ASSESSMENT RECOMMENDATIONS. ARE

00:12:21.941 --> 00:12:23.609
KEY RECOMMENDATION HERE IS OF

00:12:23.676 --> 00:12:25.344
THE LEGISLATURE TAKE A DIFFERENT

00:12:25.411 --> 00:12:26.846
APPROACH TO BUDGETING FOR YOU

00:12:26.912 --> 00:12:28.347
SEE THAN WHAT THE ADMINISTRATION

00:12:28.414 --> 00:12:30.883
PROPOSES. WE RECOMMEND THE

00:12:30.950 --> 00:12:32.818
LEGISLATURE CONSIDER. WITH THE

00:12:32.885 --> 00:12:34.453
SPECIFIC COST INCREASES IN

00:12:34.520 --> 00:12:35.254
PRIORITIES THAT WOULD LIKE TO

00:12:35.321 --> 00:12:37.289
FUND ANTI AUGMENTATIONS TO

00:12:37.356 --> 00:12:40.059
THOSE- ESTIMATED INCREASES.

00:12:40.126 --> 00:12:42.928
RATHER THAN ADOPTING ARBITRARY

00:12:42.995 --> 00:12:44.330
5% OR SOME OTHER PERCENT

00:12:44.396 --> 00:12:47.266
INCREASE WE THINK THAT APPROACH.

00:12:47.333 --> 00:12:48.567
WOULD OFFER MORE TRANSPARENCY

00:12:48.634 --> 00:12:49.802
INTO THE LEGISLATURE GREATER

00:12:49.869 --> 00:12:51.203
CONFIDENCE AS TO WHAT IT

00:12:51.270 --> 00:12:53.139
SPECIFICALLY FUNDING. WOULD ALSO

00:12:53.205 --> 00:12:56.242
THINK IT WOULD JUST LINE FOR

00:12:56.308 --> 00:12:58.477
MORE RATIONAL BUDGET DISCUSSION

00:12:58.544 --> 00:12:59.945
. THE PLACE TO START WITH-

00:13:00.012 --> 00:13:01.647
DECIDING BASED INCREASES WITH

00:13:01.714 --> 00:13:04.483
UC'S OPERATING COSTS- YOU SEE

00:13:04.550 --> 00:13:06.418
HAS WHAT YOU MIGHT CONSIDER SOME

00:13:06.485 --> 00:13:08.154
VERY BASIC OPERATING COST

00:13:08.220 --> 00:13:09.588
INCREASES. BUT IT WOULD STILL

00:13:09.655 --> 00:13:11.624
HAVE TO PAY FOR REGARDLESS OF

00:13:11.690 --> 00:13:13.225
HOW MUCH FUNDING IT GETS THESE

00:13:13.292 --> 00:13:14.727
ARE THINGS LIKE EMPLOYEE BENEFIT

00:13:14.793 --> 00:13:17.563
COST INCREASES INCREASES TO ITS

00:13:17.630 --> 00:13:18.030
OPERATING EXPENSES AND

00:13:18.097 --> 00:13:19.965
EQUIPMENT. BY DEBT SERVICE COST

00:13:20.032 --> 00:13:21.734
INCREASES AND THEN ON TOP OF

00:13:21.800 --> 00:13:23.836
THAT THE UNIVERSITY ALSO FEATURE

00:13:23.903 --> 00:13:26.071
FACES DECISIONS AROUND HOW MUCH

00:13:26.138 --> 00:13:27.706
YOU SUPPORT IN FACT AND-

00:13:27.773 --> 00:13:30.309
FOUNDRESSES FOR FACULTY AND

00:13:30.376 --> 00:13:33.245
STAFF. NO I WANT TO EMPHASIZE

00:13:33.312 --> 00:13:35.381
THAT WE DON'T HAVE A HARD

00:13:35.447 --> 00:13:36.815
RECOMMENDATION ON THE EXACT

00:13:36.882 --> 00:13:38.551
BASED INCREASED PROVIDE YOU SEE

00:13:38.617 --> 00:13:41.554
IN. THE BUDGET YEAR THAT'S NOT

00:13:41.620 --> 00:13:43.556
REALLY FALL ON THE LEGISLATURE'S

00:13:43.622 --> 00:13:45.991
PRIORITIES FOR YOU SEE AND THE

00:13:46.058 --> 00:13:46.992
SPECIFIC COST INCREASES WOULD

00:13:47.059 --> 00:13:49.595
LIKE TO SUPPORT. ALSO EMPHASIZED

00:13:49.662 --> 00:13:51.197
THAT. IT A LITTLE LEGISLATURE

00:13:51.263 --> 00:13:52.198
AFTER LOOKING AT UC'S COST

00:13:52.264 --> 00:13:55.134
INCREASES. WE MIGHT LOOK AT THE

00:13:55.201 --> 00:13:56.302
GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED BASE

00:13:56.368 --> 00:13:58.137
AUGMENTATION WHICH WE ESTIMATE

00:13:58.204 --> 00:14:00.706
WOULD COVER A UC'S BASIC

00:14:00.773 --> 00:14:02.708
OPERATING COST INCREASES AND

00:14:02.775 --> 00:14:05.277
CLOSE TO A 4% INCREASE AT ITS-

00:14:05.344 --> 00:14:08.347
ALWAYS SELL RIPPLE. I THINK THAT

00:14:08.414 --> 00:14:10.883
AUGMENTATION IS REASONABLE OUR

00:14:10.950 --> 00:14:12.017
POINT IS THAT OF THOSE COSTS

00:14:12.084 --> 00:14:13.252
SHOULD BE DRIVING THE DECISIONS

00:14:13.319 --> 00:14:16.455
NOT SOME ARBITRARY PERCENT THAT

00:14:16.522 --> 00:14:18.123
THE ADMINISTRATION HAS PROPOSED

00:14:18.190 --> 00:14:19.158
. THE LEGISLATURE SHOULD BE

00:14:19.225 --> 00:14:21.393
CAUTIOUS ABOUT. COMMITTING TO

00:14:21.460 --> 00:14:23.762

00:23:04.516 --> 00:23:07.319
INDEPENDENTLY ADOPTED- LAST YEAR

00:23:07.385 --> 00:23:10.122
AND IT TO BEGIN IN BUDGET YEAR.

00:23:10.188 --> 00:23:13.225
I THAT THAT IS PART OF THE

00:23:13.291 --> 00:23:16.094
CONTACT THE PREMISE IS THAT DAY

00:23:16.161 --> 00:23:17.462
ARE MOVING FORWARD WITH THAT-

00:23:17.529 --> 00:23:19.064
AND THE RESOURCES THEY WOULD

00:23:19.131 --> 00:23:21.399
GAIN FROM THAT I WOULD HELP

00:23:21.466 --> 00:23:25.203
ACHIEVE ALL THE AGREED UPON

00:23:25.270 --> 00:23:26.571
EXPECTATIONS THERE IS NOT A- I

00:23:26.638 --> 00:23:30.642
HAD TO WISHIN HIATUS. OF PRESUME

00:23:30.709 --> 00:23:32.878
BY- HOW THE CONTRA OF CONTACT

00:23:32.944 --> 00:23:34.713
WOULD BE AGREED TO THAT'S

00:23:34.780 --> 00:23:37.082
CORRECT YOU SEE IS NOT UP TO

00:23:37.149 --> 00:23:39.084
DATE- A COHORT BASED MODEL THAT

00:23:39.151 --> 00:23:41.586
THEY WILL ESSENTIALLY RISE WITH

00:23:41.653 --> 00:23:45.357
INFLATION. AND THEN- LET ME JUST

00:23:45.423 --> 00:23:48.493
MAKE A COMMENT BECAUSE- WE'RE

00:23:48.560 --> 00:23:50.162
EXPECTED TO APPROPRIATE MONEY

00:23:50.228 --> 00:23:52.364
BASED ON THE COMPACT AND WE

00:23:52.430 --> 00:23:54.299
HAVEN'T SEEN THE SPECIFICS OF

00:23:54.366 --> 00:23:56.468
THE COMPACT ACTUALLY AS THEY ARE

00:23:56.535 --> 00:23:58.403
GOING TO BE LAID OUT AN AGREED

00:23:58.470 --> 00:24:00.639
TO. AND I THINK WE RESERVE THE

00:24:00.705 --> 00:24:02.741
RIGHT TO ADHERE TO WHAT THE

00:24:02.808 --> 00:24:04.342
LEGISLATIVE ANALYSTS SAID OR

00:24:04.409 --> 00:24:06.978
ANYONE ELSE WITH REGARD TO OR

00:24:07.045 --> 00:24:09.247
RIGHT TO APPROPRIATE UNTIL WE

00:24:09.314 --> 00:24:10.749
HAVE SEEN THE SPECIFICS OF THE

00:24:10.816 --> 00:24:12.751
COMPACT AND I JUST WANNA MAKE

00:24:12.818 --> 00:24:15.053
THAT CLEAR I DON'T WANT TO BE

00:24:15.120 --> 00:24:16.454
ANY SURPRISE. A AND IT WILL BE

00:24:16.521 --> 00:24:18.824
CONCERNING IF IT JUST COMES OUT

00:24:18.890 --> 00:24:19.825
IN A MAY REVISE AND WE'RE

00:24:19.891 --> 00:24:22.060
SUPPOSED TO ACT IN A MATTER OF

00:24:22.127 --> 00:24:23.328
DAYS AND THERE STILL A LACK OF.

00:24:23.395 --> 00:24:25.030
THE SOME SO I JUST WANT TO BE

00:24:25.096 --> 00:24:27.866
CLEAR. WE WANT TO KNOW WE WANT

00:24:27.933 --> 00:24:30.535
CLARITY ARE WE DON'T WANT TO ACT

00:24:30.602 --> 00:24:32.370
ON THE APPROPRIATION AND TELL

00:24:32.437 --> 00:24:34.272
THAT EXISTS IN SO I JUST WANT TO

00:24:34.339 --> 00:24:36.374
MAKE THAT REALLY CLEAR FOR IT IN

00:24:36.441 --> 00:24:39.077
THE PROCESS AND- THERE IS ALSO

00:24:39.144 --> 00:24:41.046
LOTS OF CONVERSATION OUT THERE.

00:24:41.112 --> 00:24:42.480
AS IF THIS IS A FOREGONE

00:24:42.547 --> 00:24:44.883
CONCLUSION AND IT MAY WELL BE

00:24:44.950 --> 00:24:47.986
SOMETHING THAT WE AGREE WITH BUT

00:24:48.053 --> 00:24:49.888
WE WANT TO SEE IT BEFORE WE

00:24:49.955 --> 00:24:51.523
AGREE AND I DON'T THINK ANYBODY

00:24:51.590 --> 00:24:53.058
SHOULD ASSUME THAT IT IS

00:24:53.124 --> 00:24:54.726
AUTOMATICALLY BEEN AGREED TO AT

00:24:54.793 --> 00:24:59.130
THE LEGISLATIVE LEVEL UNTIL. WE

00:24:59.197 --> 00:25:00.832
CAN HAVE THE COMPLETE DETAILS-

00:25:00.899 --> 00:25:07.505
SO I JUST TO DO THAT AND THEN-

00:25:07.572 --> 00:25:11.276
IT LET ME ASK YOU SEE- IT. A. N.

00:25:11.343 --> 00:25:12.844
THIS ACTUALLY GOES TO ONE OF THE

00:25:12.911 --> 00:25:14.112
COMMENTS THAT THE LEGISLATIVE

00:25:14.179 --> 00:25:16.448
ANALYST'S MADE IT SEEMS TO BE

00:25:16.514 --> 00:25:18.917
THAT WE SHOULD ALL BE HAPPY THAT

00:25:18.984 --> 00:25:21.219
THERE'S A 5% OUT THE GATE. OUR

00:25:21.286 --> 00:25:24.089

INFLATION AND INCREASE COSTS-

00:25:28.827 --> 00:25:31.062
I'M NOT SURE 5% MEETS THE

00:25:31.129 --> 00:25:32.964
CURRENT LEVEL OF SERVICE SAID AT

00:25:33.031 --> 00:25:36.801

THAT BUT- I UNDERSTAND. THAT TO

00:28:11.022 --> 00:28:13.591
THE CAMPUSES DID NOT MEET THE

00:28:13.658 --> 00:28:15.927
NONRESIDENT ENROLLMENT CAP THAT

00:28:15.994 --> 00:28:18.663
WAS SET UP FOR FALL OF TWENTY

00:28:18.730 --> 00:28:20.632
TWENTY ONE. AND THAT PRESIDENT

00:28:20.698 --> 00:28:24.736
DRAKE IS PLANNING ON. THE WORD

00:28:24.803 --> 00:28:26.438
WAS PROVIDED TO ME PENALIZING I

00:28:26.504 --> 00:28:28.306
DON'T WANNA THROW SOMEBODY IN

00:28:28.373 --> 00:28:30.141
THE DOCK BUT THAT THERE WOULD BE

00:28:30.208 --> 00:28:35.046
SOME ACTIONS TAKEN FOR THE TWO-

00:28:35.113 --> 00:28:37.115
THAT THAT DID NOT COMPLY THAT

00:28:37.182 --> 00:28:39.651
INVOLVES. DEALING WITH THE MONEY

00:28:39.717 --> 00:28:41.753
THAT THAT IS INVOLVED THERE SO I

00:28:41.820 --> 00:28:42.587

00:28:46.558 --> 00:28:48.860
AGREEMENT AND DESCRIBED WHAT THE

00:28:48.927 --> 00:28:51.729
SITUATION IS WITH REGARD TO

THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION THE

00:28:56.334 --> 00:28:58.136
PERCENTAGES THAT YOU READ

00:28:58.203 --> 00:28:59.904
REPRESENTING YOU DO UNIVERSITY

NONRESIDENT ENROLLMENT AT THOSE

00:29:05.910 --> 00:29:09.547
SPECIFIC CAMPUSES. UP FOR FALL

00:29:09.614 --> 00:29:12.684
TWENTY TWENTY ONE- A FEW THREE

00:29:12.750 --> 00:29:15.820
CAMPUSES DID EXCEED THEIR CAPS

00:29:15.887 --> 00:29:18.389
UP BECAUSE THEY HAVE TO STAY

00:29:18.456 --> 00:29:20.925
WITHIN THE REGION'S CAP. AND THE

00:29:20.992 --> 00:29:24.729
UNIVERSITY DOES NOT WANT TO-

00:29:24.796 --> 00:29:27.065
CREATE ANY INCENTIVE FOR THESE

00:29:27.132 --> 00:29:30.168
CAMPUSES TO COPE OVER TAX CAP.

00:29:30.235 --> 00:29:32.036
PRESIDENT DRAKE HAS MADE THE

00:29:32.103 --> 00:29:34.339
DECISION THAT HE WILL REMOVE ALL

00:29:34.405 --> 00:29:36.074
OF THE NONRESIDENT SUPPLEMENTAL

00:29:36.141 --> 00:29:39.878
TUITION ABOVE THE CAP FROM THOSE

00:29:39.944 --> 00:29:41.713
CAMPUSES THAT WENT OVER TO CAP

00:29:41.779 --> 00:29:44.549
I'M PROVIDED TWO CAMPUSES THAT

00:29:44.616 --> 00:29:47.819
HAVE FEWER RESOURCES PER STUDENT

00:29:47.886 --> 00:29:50.054
TO USE AS ONE TIME REVENUE-

00:29:50.121 --> 00:29:51.623
THOSE CAMPUSES THAT WILL RECEIVE

00:29:51.689 --> 00:29:55.793
THE FUNS ARE. UC SANTA CRUZ UC

00:29:55.860 --> 00:29:57.562
MERCED UC RIVERSIDE AND THE

00:29:57.629 --> 00:29:59.764
TOTAL ALLOCATION BEING TAKEN

00:29:59.831 --> 00:30:03.067
AWAY FROM OUR LA SAN DIEGO AND

00:30:03.134 --> 00:30:06.538
IRVINE IS ABOUT TWENTY MILLION

00:30:06.604 --> 00:30:09.541
DOLLARS. AND THEN WHAT YES A

00:30:09.607 --> 00:30:11.442
FOLLOW UP QUESTION. THERE'S SOME

00:30:11.509 --> 00:30:13.878
SITUATION AND I NEVER REMEMBER

00:30:13.945 --> 00:30:15.880
WHAT IT'S ACTUALLY CALLED. WHERE

00:30:15.947 --> 00:30:18.149
THERE ARE THREE CAMPUSES THAT

00:30:18.216 --> 00:30:20.285
WERE SORT OF UNDER RESOURCE TO

00:30:20.351 --> 00:30:22.387
HISTORICALLY COMPARED TO OTHER

00:30:22.453 --> 00:30:25.256
CAMPUSES AND AT THAT PRESIDENT

00:30:25.323 --> 00:30:27.425
DRACO SAID AS A LONG TERM GOAL

00:30:27.492 --> 00:30:30.695
TO REDRESS THAT. INEQUITY TO

00:30:30.762 --> 00:30:31.996
THOSE HAPPEN TO BE THE THREE

00:30:32.063 --> 00:30:34.766
CAMPUSES TO WHICH THIS MORNING

00:30:34.832 --> 00:30:38.603
WAS JUST DIRECTED TO. THAT THAT

00:30:38.670 --> 00:30:41.940
IS CORRECT SO- WHILE OUR

00:30:42.006 --> 00:30:45.410
CAMPUSES ALL RECEIVE THE SAME

00:30:45.476 --> 00:30:48.246
DOLLARS PER STUDENT UNDER OUR

00:30:48.313 --> 00:30:50.782
RETENTION FORMULA. BECAUSE THEY

00:30:50.848 --> 00:30:52.784
HAVE A DIFFERENT MIX OF STUDENTS

00:30:52.850 --> 00:30:54.586
AND GRADUATE STUDENT MEDICAL

00:30:54.652 --> 00:30:57.088
STUDENTS AN UNDERGRADUATE

00:30:57.155 --> 00:31:00.425
STUDENT- THE AMOUNT OF MONEY

00:31:00.491 --> 00:31:02.527
NEEDED FOR DIFFERENT LEVELS OF

00:31:02.594 --> 00:31:05.330
EDUCATION VARIES. SO SOME OTHER

00:31:05.396 --> 00:31:08.933
CAMPUSES- THAT JOINT DON'T IN

00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:10.168
MORE DOLLARS FOR MEDICAL

00:31:10.235 --> 00:31:11.936
STUDENTS HAVE TRADITIONALLY

00:31:12.003 --> 00:31:13.771
RECEIVED HELPS A LITTLE BIT

00:31:13.838 --> 00:31:16.507
LESS. PER STUDENT ON THE WHOLE

00:31:16.574 --> 00:31:18.109
ON THE AVERAGE ACROSS STOCK

00:31:18.176 --> 00:31:21.613
FORMULA. WE HAVE NOW TAKEN STEPS

00:31:21.679 --> 00:31:24.515
TO CORRECT THAT. WHERE TO REAP

00:31:24.582 --> 00:31:27.018
BENCHING FORMULA OUR HUSBAND

00:31:27.085 --> 00:31:29.954
WHERE REWRITING IT TO- STATE

00:31:30.021 --> 00:31:31.489
THAT NO CAMPUS WILL GET LESS

00:31:31.556 --> 00:31:36.094
THAN 95% OF THE- AVERAGE FOR THE

00:31:36.160 --> 00:31:37.362
CAMPUS DOES. SO THIS SHOULD

00:31:37.428 --> 00:31:39.764
BEGIN CORRECTING SOME OF THOSE

00:31:39.831 --> 00:31:45.870
HISTORICAL- BUILT IN. BOB INEC

00:31:45.937 --> 00:31:50.408
THERE ISN'T IT NEVER ASSUME OF-

00:31:50.475 --> 00:31:52.410
HOT STUDENTS THAT WE WERE

00:31:52.477 --> 00:31:55.413
WAITING AS- HAS BEEN AND IF I

00:31:55.480 --> 00:31:57.215
ASK YOU THIS QUESTION HOPEFULLY

00:31:57.282 --> 00:31:58.182
BY THE THIRD YEAR I WILL

00:31:58.249 --> 00:32:00.551
REMEMBER WHAT'S THE NAME OF THIS

00:32:00.618 --> 00:32:02.420
PROGRAM. HOW DO YOU DESCRIBE

00:32:02.487 --> 00:32:03.921
THIS WHEN YOU'RE TO LOOK AT

00:32:03.988 --> 00:32:06.591
THESE BEING ADDRESSED YEAH WE

00:32:06.658 --> 00:32:10.128
CALL IT OUR RETENTION PROGRAM

00:32:10.194 --> 00:32:12.063
OKAY RETENTION. I'M SURE IS

00:32:12.130 --> 00:32:16.034
THERE SOME. SPORTS POND TO BE

00:32:16.100 --> 00:32:18.269
MADE IN CONJUNCTION WITH THAT

00:32:18.336 --> 00:32:20.805
BUT THE THREE ARE JUST

00:32:20.872 --> 00:32:22.507
COINCIDENTALLY OR THREE THAT

00:32:22.573 --> 00:32:25.743
DON'T HAVE A MEDICAL FACILITIES

00:32:25.810 --> 00:32:28.513
RIGHT OR- IS THAT ONE OF THE

00:32:28.579 --> 00:32:30.315
DISTINCTIONS THAT CAUSES FOR THE

00:32:30.381 --> 00:32:33.084
DIFFERENCE. BUT THAT THAT IS

00:32:33.151 --> 00:32:35.553
CORRECT CENTER LAYERED WHILE UC

00:32:35.620 --> 00:32:37.722
RIVERSIDE NOW HAS A MEDICAL

00:32:37.789 --> 00:32:39.590
SCHOOL THAT IS A RELATIVELY

00:32:39.657 --> 00:32:43.194
RECENT ADDITION TO THAT CAMPUS-

00:32:43.261 --> 00:32:46.497
AND UC SANTA CRUZ AND UC MERCED

00:32:46.564 --> 00:32:47.498
DO NOT CURRENTLY HAVE MEDICAL

00:32:47.565 --> 00:32:51.135
SCHOOLS- AND THEN- DOES THAT

00:32:51.202 --> 00:32:53.971
MEAN THAT. IF THE CAMPUSES IN

00:32:54.038 --> 00:32:56.007
QUESTION THAT WERE OVER THE CAP

00:32:56.074 --> 00:32:57.975
THIS YEAR ARE OVER THE CAP NEXT

00:32:58.042 --> 00:32:59.977
YEAR THERE WILL BE SOME SIMILAR

00:33:00.044 --> 00:33:01.979
THING THAT HAPPENS THAT THAT'S

00:33:02.046 --> 00:33:03.681
THE ENFORCEMENT MECHANISM THAT

00:33:03.748 --> 00:33:05.016
THE PRESIDENT IS USING AGAINST

00:33:05.083 --> 00:33:09.187
CAMPUSES THAT THE DUMP ME TO CAP

00:33:09.253 --> 00:33:10.688
. THAT DECISION IS UP TO

00:33:10.755 --> 00:33:14.058
PRESIDENT DRAKE- FOR NEXT YEAR

00:33:14.125 --> 00:33:17.562
FALL TWENTY TWENTY TWO- UCLA AND

00:33:17.628 --> 00:33:20.398
UC SAN DIEGO WE NEED TO REDUCE

00:33:20.465 --> 00:33:23.234
THE LOAD THE REGION'S TOP FIVE

00:33:23.301 --> 00:33:24.135
THREE HUNDRED STUDENTS WILL

00:33:24.202 --> 00:33:25.303
SPEAK ABOUT THAT IN THE NEXT

00:33:25.370 --> 00:33:29.874
ITEM. IN SOME MORE DETAIL I KNOW

00:33:29.941 --> 00:33:30.742
THE NEXT I'D MISS IN ROMA TO.

00:33:30.808 --> 00:33:32.610
PROBABLY SHOULD HAVE A DEFERRED

00:33:32.677 --> 00:33:34.812
TILL THEN AND THEN LET ME ASK

00:33:34.879 --> 00:33:36.581
ABOUT ONE OF OUR FAVORITE TOPICS

00:33:36.647 --> 00:33:39.484
BUXBAUM- THE SUBJECT OF

00:33:39.550 --> 00:33:41.719
CONTRACTING OUT IN THE LETTER

00:33:41.786 --> 00:33:44.889
WAS PROVIDED THE LEGISLATURE.

00:33:44.956 --> 00:33:48.192

LAST AND IT WITH US FOR

00:33:57.869 --> 00:34:00.238
INSTANCES IN WHICH- THERE WAS

00:34:00.304 --> 00:34:02.573
SOME SPECIAL CONTRACTING OUT

00:34:02.640 --> 00:34:05.843
THAT NEEDED TO BE CALLED OUT.

00:34:05.910 --> 00:34:09.447
AND IF THOSE FOR INSTANCES ALL

00:34:09.514 --> 00:34:10.448
HAPPENED IN THIS PAST FISCAL

00:34:10.515 --> 00:34:13.084
YEAR BUT THE LETTER DOESN'T GIVE

00:34:13.151 --> 00:34:15.486
A FULLER PICTURE OF WHAT DID

00:34:15.553 --> 00:34:17.021
HAPPEN UNDER THE AGREEMENT IT

SUCCESSFUL THE UNIVERSITY OF

00:34:26.597 --> 00:34:30.535
CALIFORNIA HAS BEEN IN-

CAME IN TWENTY TWENTY WITH

00:34:34.872 --> 00:34:38.676
REGARD TO THE SUBJECT. THANK YOU

EIGHT TWENTY REQUIRED THAT FOR

00:34:44.782 --> 00:34:46.784
THOSE BUILDINGS THAT RECEIVE

STATE GENERAL FUND FOR A CAPITAL

00:34:50.054 --> 00:34:52.657
OUTLAY PROJECT ONCE THAT PROJECT

CERTIFY ON THAT BUILDING GOING

00:34:57.562 --> 00:35:00.298
BACK TO TWENTY SEVENTEEN. IF

00:35:00.364 --> 00:35:04.368
THERE HAD BEEN ANY CONTRACTS-

00:35:04.435 --> 00:35:08.105
FOR OUTSIDE WORK TO BE PERFORMED

00:35:08.172 --> 00:35:11.809
BY- NON UNIVERSITY EMPLOYEES FOR

00:35:11.876 --> 00:35:13.511
WORK THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN

00:35:13.578 --> 00:35:15.279
OTHERWISE TRADITIONALLY

00:35:15.346 --> 00:35:17.648
PERFORMED BY ASKS ME AS SEX

00:35:17.715 --> 00:35:22.420
BARGAINING UNIT. AND WE HAVE

00:35:22.487 --> 00:35:25.189
BEEN REPORTING ON THOSE- ARE

00:35:25.256 --> 00:35:26.824
THOSE INSTANCES THAT HAVE

00:35:26.891 --> 00:35:29.293
OCCURRED AS NEW BUILDINGS HAVE

00:35:29.360 --> 00:35:31.462
COME ONLINE THE KEY UNDER THE S.

00:35:31.529 --> 00:35:35.666
B. EIGHT TWENTY RUBRIC- AND WE

00:35:35.733 --> 00:35:37.702
HAVE BEEN AS THOSE BUILDINGS

00:35:37.768 --> 00:35:39.203
HAVE BEEN COMING ONLINE WE HAVE

00:35:39.270 --> 00:35:41.172
BEEN ELIMINATING OUR FUTURE

00:35:41.239 --> 00:35:44.041
CONTRACTS IN THOSE BUILDINGS. SO

00:35:44.108 --> 00:35:45.710
IN THE MOST RECENT REPORT THAT

00:35:45.776 --> 00:35:49.046
YOU SAW THE FOR EXCEPTIONS- TWO

00:35:49.113 --> 00:35:51.916
OF THEM ARE ON TRACK TO BE

00:35:51.983 --> 00:35:54.652
ELIMINATED ONE MAY NOT HAVE BEEN

00:35:54.719 --> 00:35:56.454
UNNECESSARY REPORTING TO BE CAN

00:35:56.521 --> 00:35:59.090
WEST AND THE OTHER WE ARE

00:35:59.156 --> 00:36:01.726
EXAMINING THOSE ARE THOSE ARE

00:36:01.792 --> 00:36:03.327
THE EXCEPTIONS CURRENTLY. AND

00:36:03.394 --> 00:36:05.630
THAT MEANS THAT THERE SOMEPLACE

00:36:05.696 --> 00:36:08.332
THAT IT'S POSTED. ARE WHAT YOU

00:36:08.399 --> 00:36:09.834
MENTIONED WITH THE GENERAL

00:36:09.901 --> 00:36:12.603
COMPLIANCE THAT EXIST SOMEWHERE

00:36:12.670 --> 00:36:16.274
THAT PEOPLE CAN ACCESS. THERE

00:36:16.340 --> 00:36:19.544
REQUIREMENTS REMEASUREMENT ONLY

00:36:19.610 --> 00:36:23.147
THE EXCEPTIONS BE REPORTED. YES

00:36:23.214 --> 00:36:25.550
SO THEIR STATUTE REQUIRES THAT

00:36:25.616 --> 00:36:28.819
ONLY BE EXCEPTIONS ARE REPORTED

00:36:28.886 --> 00:36:32.023
. THANK YOU. I'M GOING TO GO TO

00:36:32.089 --> 00:36:34.492
PASS UNDER A CHOI BOGUE AND

00:36:34.559 --> 00:36:35.993
FENNEL ASSESS WEST WHETHER

00:36:36.060 --> 00:36:37.828
SENATOR MEANS TO QUESTIONS ON

00:36:37.895 --> 00:36:39.764
THIS I HAVE BEEN ASKED WHEN

00:36:39.830 --> 00:36:44.602
SHE'S DONE SENATOR OCHO BOOK-

00:36:44.669 --> 00:36:47.171
SENATOR. THERE'D THIS WAS WITH

00:36:47.238 --> 00:36:49.640
THE TO OF. WHAT IS THE REASON

00:36:49.707 --> 00:36:50.808
FOR PROVIDING THE UC

00:36:50.875 --> 00:36:53.477
UNRESTRICTED BASE GROWTH GIVEN

00:36:53.544 --> 00:36:55.813
THE L. A. O.'S COMMENT THAT THEY

00:36:55.880 --> 00:36:57.682
BELIEVE IT IS A POOR APPROACH TO

00:36:57.748 --> 00:37:01.652
BUDGETING FOR OPERATING COST.

00:37:01.719 --> 00:37:02.620
THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION

00:37:02.687 --> 00:37:05.056
CENTER. SO FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE

00:37:05.122 --> 00:37:07.191
THIS- THERE'S A COUPLE REASONS-

00:37:07.258 --> 00:37:09.927
THE FIRST IS THAT THE STATE HAS

00:37:09.994 --> 00:37:11.562
TAKEN THIS APPROACH IN THE PAST

00:37:11.629 --> 00:37:13.030
. SAMPLE THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE

00:37:13.097 --> 00:37:16.701
BUDGET ACT PROVIDED A 5%

00:37:16.767 --> 00:37:18.869
FLEXIBLE BASE AUGMENTATION. I

00:37:18.936 --> 00:37:20.471
WAS A HUNDRED AND SEVENTY THREE

00:37:20.538 --> 00:37:22.039
POINT TWO LAST YEAR WE'RE

00:37:22.106 --> 00:37:24.575
PROPOSING A TWO HUNDRED POINT

00:37:24.642 --> 00:37:26.177
FIVE VERSION OF THAT THIS YEAR

00:37:26.243 --> 00:37:28.579
AS THE- FIRST OF SEVERAL SO IN

00:37:28.646 --> 00:37:30.147
OUR VIEW IT'S A CONTINUATION UP

00:37:30.214 --> 00:37:32.116
APPROVING PRACTICE THAT THE

00:37:32.183 --> 00:37:35.820
STATE HAS USED. AB ALL I WILL

00:37:35.886 --> 00:37:36.854
JUST KNOW THAT ON THE

00:37:36.921 --> 00:37:38.389
PERSPECTIVE THAT IT'S ARBITRARY

00:37:38.456 --> 00:37:40.391
WE JUST DON'T WE DON'T SHARE

00:37:40.458 --> 00:37:42.226
THAT PERSPECTIVE FROM THE

00:37:42.293 --> 00:37:44.895
STATE'S VIEW THERE'S- THERE'S

00:37:44.962 --> 00:37:48.733
AVAILABLE RESOURCES SO WE CAN'T

00:37:48.799 --> 00:37:51.302
ALWAYS THINK ABOUT BUDGETS ONE

00:37:51.369 --> 00:37:53.137
TO ONE DOWN THE LINE BUT FROM A

00:37:53.204 --> 00:37:55.573
UC BUDGETING PERSPECTIVE WE HAVE

00:37:55.640 --> 00:37:57.575
WORKED WITH THE UC TO ADDRESS

00:37:57.642 --> 00:37:59.443
THEIR NEEDS THAT'S PART OF

00:37:59.510 --> 00:38:01.479
NEGOTIATING THE CONTRACT OR THE-

00:38:01.545 --> 00:38:03.981
MULTI YEAR COMPACT. AND THEN

00:38:04.048 --> 00:38:04.849
ULTIMATELY THE BIGGEST ONE FROM

00:38:04.915 --> 00:38:06.851
OUR VIEW THAT I THINK WE HAVE

00:38:06.917 --> 00:38:08.953
TYPICALLY HAD A DIFFERENT VIEW

00:38:09.020 --> 00:38:11.455
OF THE L. L. IS THAT FLEXIBILITY

00:38:11.522 --> 00:38:13.324
IS THE BEST WAY WE BELIEVE FOR

00:38:13.391 --> 00:38:17.361
THE UC TO ACHIEVE THE GOALS THAT

00:38:17.428 --> 00:38:18.929
THAT THE ADMINISTRATION HAS FOR

00:38:18.996 --> 00:38:21.599
THIS THIS TWENTY TWO TWENTY

00:38:21.666 --> 00:38:23.467
THREE BUDGET ACT OR GOVERNOR'S

00:38:23.534 --> 00:38:25.603
BUDGET ALSO THE MULTI YEAR

00:38:25.670 --> 00:38:28.205
COMPACT AND IN GENERAL THAT'S

00:38:28.272 --> 00:38:31.075
THAT'S WORKED IN THE PAST WHERE-

00:38:31.142 --> 00:38:34.612
NOT A ONE TO ONE. WE DON'T WE'RE

00:38:34.679 --> 00:38:36.147
NOT TRYING TO TIE THE HANDS OF

00:38:36.213 --> 00:38:39.183
YOU SEE TO SAY. X. WAS WITH WITH

00:38:39.250 --> 00:38:40.418
THESE EGGS AMOUNTS BECAUSE WE

00:38:40.484 --> 00:38:41.919
RECOGNIZE THAT AS KOBE

00:38:41.986 --> 00:38:43.220
DEMONSTRATED THERE'S A LOT OF

00:38:43.287 --> 00:38:45.122
THINGS THAT ARE SHIPPED AROUND

00:38:45.189 --> 00:38:51.896
YEAR TO YEAR. OKAY WITH THE L.

00:38:51.962 --> 00:38:57.435
A- LIKE TO RESPOND. SURE SO AS

00:38:57.501 --> 00:38:59.003
THE RESTORATION NOTES THIS HAS

00:38:59.070 --> 00:39:01.138
BEEN A LONG STANDING UP A

00:39:01.205 --> 00:39:02.606
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN US AND THE

00:39:02.673 --> 00:39:04.942
ADMINISTRATION AND ALSO THE

00:39:05.009 --> 00:39:06.477
PREVIOUS ADMINISTRATION TO. ON

00:39:06.544 --> 00:39:07.812
THE STATE HISTORICALLY HAS

00:39:07.878 --> 00:39:11.082
PROVIDED- YOU KNOW BASICALLY

00:39:11.148 --> 00:39:12.550
SAYS BASED ON A CERTAIN PERCENT

00:39:12.616 --> 00:39:13.718
THAT WAS DECIDED BY THE

00:39:13.784 --> 00:39:15.519
ADMINISTRATION SOME YEARS IT WAS

00:39:15.586 --> 00:39:17.922
FIVE PERCENT. SOME YEARS IT WAS

00:39:17.988 --> 00:39:19.690
FOUR PERCENT- I ACTUALLY WE

00:39:19.757 --> 00:39:21.158
ACTUALLY HAVE A FIGURE IN THEIR

00:39:21.225 --> 00:39:28.232
AGENDA- ON PAGE- FIVE FIGURE ONE

00:39:28.299 --> 00:39:29.533
THAT THAT JUST THAT'S SOME RISE

00:39:29.600 --> 00:39:31.535
ALL THE BASE INCREASES. THERE

00:39:31.602 --> 00:39:34.205
WAS ONE YEAR WHERE THE STATE DID

00:39:34.271 --> 00:39:35.840
. ARE CONNECTED TO SPECIFIC COST

00:39:35.906 --> 00:39:37.675
INCREASES THAT WAS IN NINETEEN

00:39:37.742 --> 00:39:38.876
TWENTY SO THE STATE HAS DONE

00:39:38.943 --> 00:39:40.745
THAT BEFORE THAT THAT SEEM TO

00:39:40.811 --> 00:39:43.247
WORK WELL- THE STATED THAT.

00:39:43.314 --> 00:39:44.582
UNDER FUNDAMENTAL CONCERN AGAIN

00:39:44.648 --> 00:39:46.283
IS THAT THE LEGISLATURE REALLY

00:39:46.350 --> 00:39:47.785
HAS VERY LITTLE INFORMATION WHEN

00:39:47.852 --> 00:39:49.920
IT TEXAS BASED INCREASE APPROACH

00:39:49.987 --> 00:39:50.588
AS TO WHAT SPECIFICALLY

00:39:50.654 --> 00:39:52.389
SUPPORTING. AND THIS IS IN PART

00:39:52.456 --> 00:39:56.460
BECAUSE THE UNIVERSITY DOESN'T-

00:39:56.527 --> 00:39:58.696
YOU KNOW. ALL HER BUDGET PLAN

00:39:58.763 --> 00:40:00.731
UNTIL OUT THE AND ACTED. THE

00:40:00.798 --> 00:40:02.133
LEGISLATURE REALLY DOESN'T KNOW

00:40:02.199 --> 00:40:03.367
WHAT IS GOING FOR COST INCREASES

00:40:03.434 --> 00:40:04.835
WHAT IS GOING FOR SALARY

00:40:04.902 --> 00:40:06.670
INCREASES- IF THE LEGISLATURE

00:40:06.737 --> 00:40:08.205
HAS SPECIFIC PRIORITIES LIKE IT

00:40:08.272 --> 00:40:09.673
WANTS TO SUPPORT CERTAIN STUDENT

00:40:09.740 --> 00:40:11.876
SUCCESS INITIATIVES THAT HAS.

00:40:11.942 --> 00:40:13.244
VERY LITTLE CONFIDENCE JUST.

00:40:13.310 --> 00:40:14.779
PROVIDING A BASE INCREASING

00:40:14.845 --> 00:40:15.880
THAT'S WHAT THE FUNDING IS BEING

00:40:15.946 --> 00:40:17.081
USED FOR. THAT'S WHY WE THINK

00:40:17.148 --> 00:40:18.215
TYING IT TO SPECIFIC COST

00:40:18.282 --> 00:40:20.551
INCREASES OF A MORE EFFECTIVE

00:40:20.618 --> 00:40:22.453
APPROACH- WE CAN HEARD WITH THE

00:40:22.520 --> 00:40:23.854
MISTER. THAT THE LEGISLATURE

00:40:23.921 --> 00:40:25.156
LEGISLATORS ON THE STATE'S

00:40:25.222 --> 00:40:26.323
BUDGET SITUATIONS DIFFERENT

00:40:26.390 --> 00:40:28.192
EVERY YEAR IT'S REASONABLE THAT

00:40:28.259 --> 00:40:30.895
THE STATE WOULD- YOU KNOW

00:40:30.961 --> 00:40:32.263
REVISIT HOW MUCH FUNDING IT HAS

00:40:32.329 --> 00:40:34.965
AVAILABLE FOR ON GOING BASE

00:40:35.032 --> 00:40:36.267
INCREASES THAT YOU SEE EACH YEAR

00:40:36.333 --> 00:40:37.234
. I ACTUALLY THINK THAT'S ONE

00:40:37.301 --> 00:40:38.469
REASON WHY WE WOULD CAUTION

00:40:38.536 --> 00:40:41.038
AGAINST- COMMITTING IT TOO FAR

00:40:41.105 --> 00:40:42.907
IN THE FUTURE TO THE SORT OF

00:40:42.973 --> 00:40:44.809
ARBITRARY BASE INCREASES- HAD

00:40:44.875 --> 00:40:46.877
THAT STATE TAKEN THAT APPROACH

00:40:46.944 --> 00:40:49.480
TWO YEARS AGO- IT WOULD NOT HAVE

00:40:49.547 --> 00:40:50.848
INSTEAD OF THE PANDEMIC WOULD

00:40:50.915 --> 00:40:53.017
HAVE HAD TO REACT ON THAT PRETTY

00:40:53.083 --> 00:40:54.318
QUICKLY- AND- AND REDUCE UC'S

00:40:54.385 --> 00:40:56.220
BUDGET. I'M SO WE DO THINK THAT

00:40:56.287 --> 00:40:57.388
THE BUDGET SITUATION IS

00:40:57.454 --> 00:40:58.556
SOMETHING LEGISLATURE SHOULD

00:40:58.622 --> 00:40:59.423
KEEP IN MIND THAT DOESN'T

00:40:59.490 --> 00:41:00.691
PRECLUDE THE LEGISLATURE

00:41:00.758 --> 00:41:01.492
NONETHELESS FROM UNDERSTANDING

00:41:01.559 --> 00:41:04.428
UC'S. COST DRIVERS ARE TRYING

00:41:04.495 --> 00:41:06.430
TO. TIE ITS- FUNDING

00:41:06.497 --> 00:41:09.099
AUGMENTATIONS TO THE SPECIFIC

00:41:09.166 --> 00:41:12.102
COST DRIVERS. THANK YOU. THANK

00:41:12.169 --> 00:41:16.540
YOU- SO JUST SO THAT I AM CLEAR

00:41:16.607 --> 00:41:17.942
. RIGHT NOW WITH THE WAY THAT WE

00:41:18.008 --> 00:41:20.077
SEE IT IS A IT'S A 5% INCREASE

00:41:20.144 --> 00:41:22.046
FOR THE NEXT FIVE YEARS A YEAR

00:41:22.112 --> 00:41:24.448
FIVE YEAR PER YEAR. FOR THE NEXT

00:41:24.515 --> 00:41:25.983
FIVE YEARS YES THAT'S WHAT

00:41:26.050 --> 00:41:27.051
THEY'RE PROPOSING THAT'S WHAT

00:41:27.117 --> 00:41:28.652
THEY'RE PROPOSING AND THE L. A.

00:41:28.719 --> 00:41:30.588
ALWAYS HAVING CONCERNS ABOUT

00:41:30.654 --> 00:41:33.757
COMMITTING. THAT FUNDING. FOR

00:41:33.824 --> 00:41:36.026
THE NEXT FIVE YEARS. I THINK

00:41:36.093 --> 00:41:39.163
THE- THE THIS IS US- ARE YOU

00:41:39.230 --> 00:41:40.297
PUTTING WORDS IN THE MOUTH OF

00:41:40.364 --> 00:41:41.966
FINANCE AND NOW ME PUTTING WORDS

00:41:42.032 --> 00:41:43.334
IN THE MOUTH OF THE ALLEY- BUT I

00:41:43.400 --> 00:41:47.004
THINK THAT THERE. ARE IT'S NOT

00:41:47.071 --> 00:41:48.372
THAT THAT THEY HAVE A PROBLEM

00:41:48.439 --> 00:41:50.040
WITH PUTTING THE RESOURCES TO

00:41:50.107 --> 00:41:51.876
LEGISLATIVE ANALYST IT'S JUST

00:41:51.942 --> 00:41:53.577
THAT THEY BELIEVED THAT A NUMBER

00:41:53.644 --> 00:41:55.646
5% EVERY YEAR IS ARBITRARY AND

00:41:55.713 --> 00:41:57.214
THAT YOU SHOULD TURN IT TO

00:41:57.281 --> 00:42:01.085
SPECIFIC EXPENSES OR NEEDS. AND

00:42:01.151 --> 00:42:03.087
CREATE ACCOUNTABILITY AND- ARE

00:42:03.153 --> 00:42:04.688
THERE ANY CONCERNS THAT WE WOULD

00:42:04.755 --> 00:42:05.856
BE ABLE TO MEET THAT. THAT

00:42:05.923 --> 00:42:09.293
COMMITMENT. WELL ACTUALLY LET'S

00:42:09.360 --> 00:42:11.795
DIRECT THAT THE A. I. I'M

00:42:11.862 --> 00:42:12.930
ACTUALLY HAVING A GREAT TIME

00:42:12.997 --> 00:42:14.665
RESPONDING FOR FINANCING THE L.

00:42:14.732 --> 00:42:17.601
A. OPENED A I THINK LET'S LET.

00:42:17.668 --> 00:42:21.372
OF FINANCE RESPOND TO THAT. SO

00:42:21.438 --> 00:42:22.973
THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION I DO

00:42:23.040 --> 00:42:27.244
APPRECIATE IT- SURE LAYERED- THE

00:42:27.311 --> 00:42:28.712
PRE ANSWER NO FROM FINANCES

00:42:28.779 --> 00:42:30.447
PERSPECTIVE THE MINISTRATION

00:42:30.514 --> 00:42:32.783
CONSIDER THE 5% THE RIGHT. THE

00:42:32.850 --> 00:42:35.052
RIGHT AMOUNT BECAUSE WE WERE

00:42:35.119 --> 00:42:36.520
VERY CAREFUL ABOUT LOOKING AT

00:42:36.587 --> 00:42:40.057
THE OUT YEARS- AND- WE RECOGNIZE

00:42:40.124 --> 00:42:41.659
THAT THAT SOMETHING LIKE A COVE

00:42:41.725 --> 00:42:43.694
IT IS- YOU KNOW THERE'S ECONOMIC

00:42:43.761 --> 00:42:46.397
SHOCKS THAT. CAN RESTRUCTURE

00:42:46.463 --> 00:42:48.365
THINGS BUT- THIS IS OUR ATTEMPT

00:42:48.432 --> 00:42:50.868
AT GIVEN WHAT WE KNOW AND GIVEN

00:42:50.935 --> 00:42:53.037
THE STATE'S AVAILABLE RESOURCES

00:42:53.103 --> 00:42:55.172
WE STRUCTURE THE BUDGET IN A WAY

00:42:55.239 --> 00:42:57.107
THAT'S NOT JUST LOOKING AT THE

00:42:57.174 --> 00:42:59.843
UC RISEN OVERALL FISCAL.

00:42:59.910 --> 00:43:02.012
SUSTAINABILITY ARCHITECTURE THIS

00:43:02.079 --> 00:43:03.814
ADMINISTRATION'S BEEN VERY LASER

00:43:03.881 --> 00:43:07.051
FOCUSED ON. AND SO DOES THIS 5%

00:43:07.117 --> 00:43:09.053
FOR US IS WHAT WE SEE AS THE

00:43:09.119 --> 00:43:11.388
AVAILABLE RESOURCES- THAT WE

00:43:11.455 --> 00:43:13.457
COULD CONTRIBUTE TO THE UC. AND

00:43:13.524 --> 00:43:15.893
THAT WE COULD ACHIEVE THE GOALS

00:43:15.960 --> 00:43:18.262
THAT WE AGREED UPON WITH THE UC

00:43:18.329 --> 00:43:19.530
TOWARDS TOWARDS WORKING ON. IN

00:43:19.596 --> 00:43:22.232
THE FIVE YEAR PERIOD AND- GO

00:43:22.299 --> 00:43:23.934
AHEAD MR CONTENT TO OTHERS FROM

00:43:24.001 --> 00:43:27.538
THE HELLO- I ALSO WANTED JUST A

00:43:27.604 --> 00:43:29.840
CLEAR FIVE POINT TO JUST HAVE-

00:43:29.907 --> 00:43:31.208
MAKE SURE YOU KNOW AS YOU'RE

00:43:31.275 --> 00:43:34.178
WEIGHING YOUR OPTIONS HERE- YOU

00:43:34.244 --> 00:43:35.713
KNOW THAT THE PROPOSAL BEFORE

00:43:35.779 --> 00:43:37.114
THE LITERAL COMPOSABLE FOR YOU

00:43:37.181 --> 00:43:38.916
IS A FIVE PERCENT. INCREASE IN

00:43:38.983 --> 00:43:41.185
THE BUDGET YEAR TWENTY TWO

00:43:41.251 --> 00:43:41.986
TWENTY THREE THE ADMINISTRATION

00:43:42.052 --> 00:43:44.121
HAS ANNOUNCED A COMPACT A MULTI

00:43:44.188 --> 00:43:45.456
YEAR CONTRACT THAT WOULD LIKE TO

00:43:45.522 --> 00:43:47.157
IMPLEMENT BUT A DOCTOR THE

00:43:47.224 --> 00:43:49.159
INCREASE THIS YEAR DOES THAT-

00:43:49.226 --> 00:43:50.060
NECESSARILY COMMIT THE

00:43:50.127 --> 00:43:51.829
LEGISLATURE TO THOSE INCREASES

00:43:51.895 --> 00:43:53.197
IN THE FUTURE. SO EACH YEAR THE

00:43:53.263 --> 00:43:54.465
LEGISLATURE COULD CONTINUE TO

00:43:54.531 --> 00:43:58.235
REVISIT THE CONTACT- AND- I JUST

00:43:58.302 --> 00:43:59.870
FUNDING ACCORDINGLY SO IT DOES

00:43:59.937 --> 00:44:01.572
IT'S NOT LIKE IF YOU WERE JUST

00:44:01.638 --> 00:44:02.606
AN INCREASE THIS YEAR YOU'VE

00:44:02.673 --> 00:44:06.710
YOU'VE COMMITTED DOWN THE ROAD.

00:44:06.777 --> 00:44:07.277
LEGISLATURE STILL HAS SOME.

00:44:07.344 --> 00:44:09.313
DISCRETION I THINK OUR POINT IS

00:44:09.380 --> 00:44:10.214
JUST WANT TO COST THE

00:44:10.280 --> 00:44:10.714
LEGISLATURE AGAINST FOR

00:44:10.781 --> 00:44:12.149
COMMITTING TO IT- AGAIN IT'S

00:44:12.216 --> 00:44:13.784
GONNA IT'S- POSSIBILITY TO

00:44:13.851 --> 00:44:15.753
REVISIT THINGS AND YOU. YEARS AS

00:44:15.819 --> 00:44:16.687
- BUDGET CONDITIONS CHANGE AS

00:44:16.754 --> 00:44:20.057
COST PRESSURES CHANGE. AND I

00:44:20.124 --> 00:44:22.593
THINK THIS IS WHERE I WOULD MAKE

00:44:22.659 --> 00:44:25.229
A COMMENT A- IN THAT IS AS I

00:44:25.295 --> 00:44:27.464
RECALL BEING RESOURCES SECRETARY

00:44:27.531 --> 00:44:31.635
AND- US SITTING IN THE CHAIR-

00:44:31.702 --> 00:44:35.539
BASS HAVING THEM ASK ME ABOUT A

00:44:35.606 --> 00:44:36.740
HUNDRED. I THINK IT WAS A

00:44:36.807 --> 00:44:37.474
HUNDRED MILLION DOLLAR

00:44:37.541 --> 00:44:39.276
COMMITMENT EVERY YEAR FOR FIVE

00:44:39.343 --> 00:44:40.844
YEARS OR FIVE HUNDRED FOR FIRE

00:44:40.911 --> 00:44:43.747
PREVENTION AND IT MAY BE

00:44:43.814 --> 00:44:45.682
RESPONDING THAT I LOOKED UP AT

00:44:45.749 --> 00:44:47.684
THE COMMITTEE AND I ONLY SAW ONE

00:44:47.751 --> 00:44:49.486
LEGISLATOR THAT'D BEEN THERE IN

00:44:49.553 --> 00:44:52.623
BAD ECONOMIC TIMES. AND THAT

00:44:52.689 --> 00:44:55.692
WHEN YOU COMMIT 45% A YEAR OVER

00:44:55.759 --> 00:44:58.395
FIVE YEARS. IF WE JUST HAPPEN TO

00:44:58.462 --> 00:45:00.497
HAVE SOMETHING THAT WAS EVEN

00:45:00.564 --> 00:45:02.566
HALFWAY TOWARD THE GREAT

00:45:02.633 --> 00:45:05.035
RECESSION OF TWO THOUSAND NINE

00:45:05.102 --> 00:45:07.604
TEN AND ELEVEN IT WOULD SEVERELY

00:45:07.671 --> 00:45:09.773
IMPACT THE STATE'S ABILITYTO

00:45:09.840 --> 00:45:11.742
MAKE GOOD ON THAT 5% A YEAR AND

00:45:11.809 --> 00:45:13.811
I THINK. I'M JUST PUTTING A

00:45:13.877 --> 00:45:15.646
FINER POINT ON WHAT DELAY- JUST

00:45:15.712 --> 00:45:17.481
SAID BECAUSE IT REALLY IS

00:45:17.548 --> 00:45:21.385
SUBJECT TO IT YOU KNOW BEFORE

00:45:21.452 --> 00:45:24.822
THE- ECONOMIC DOWNTURN WE WERE

00:45:24.888 --> 00:45:28.325
IN THE LARGEST CONTINUOUS PERIOD

00:45:28.392 --> 00:45:29.993
OF EXPANSION SINCE WORLD WAR

00:45:30.060 --> 00:45:31.428
TWO. HAND PEOPLE FORGOT WHAT

00:45:31.495 --> 00:45:33.263
IT'S LIKE TO HAVE THE TROUGHS OF

00:45:33.330 --> 00:45:34.898
IT GOING DOWN SO IF THERE'S A

00:45:34.965 --> 00:45:36.767
TROUGH IT GOING DOWN IN THE NEXT

00:45:36.834 --> 00:45:37.534
FIVE YEARS WILL BE VERY

00:45:37.601 --> 00:45:41.872
DIFFICULT TO BEAT UP 5% COMPARED

00:45:41.939 --> 00:45:44.374
. BUT OUR- BUT YOU'RE ASKING

00:45:44.441 --> 00:45:45.742
QUESTIONS ABOUT WHAT YOU SEE IF

00:45:45.809 --> 00:45:46.977
YOU OF ANOTHER ONE YOU WANT TO

00:45:47.044 --> 00:45:48.745
GO TO THAT I THINK YOU'RE I

00:45:48.812 --> 00:45:50.147
THINK YOU UNDERSTAND MY POINT OF

00:45:50.214 --> 00:45:51.682
YOU KNOW I THINK YOU JUST

00:45:51.748 --> 00:45:52.950
ACTUALLY ADDRESS THE CONCERN

00:45:53.016 --> 00:45:54.551
THAT I HAVE MOVING FORWARD YOU

00:45:54.618 --> 00:45:56.353
KNOW MAKING A COMMITMENT FIVE

00:45:56.420 --> 00:45:59.123
YEARS ON THE LINE- ON A GOOD

00:45:59.189 --> 00:46:01.492
YEAR. AS WE HAVE TO. THIS YEAR.

00:46:01.558 --> 00:46:03.827
JUST MAKES ME A BIT NERVOUS- AND

00:46:03.894 --> 00:46:05.329
I'VE AND I ACTUALLY APPRECIATE

00:46:05.395 --> 00:46:08.298
THE COMMENT THAT WE SHOULD- MAKE

00:46:08.365 --> 00:46:09.900
IT A PRIORITY TO HAVE THE

00:46:09.967 --> 00:46:11.969
LEGISLATURE HAS THE ABILITY TO

00:46:12.035 --> 00:46:14.605
EVALUATE OR REEVALUATE EVERY

00:46:14.671 --> 00:46:17.574
SINGLE YEAR- IN GOING BACK TO

00:46:17.641 --> 00:46:19.510
THE- THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE

00:46:19.576 --> 00:46:22.179
IS A COMMENT THAT- WITH REGARDS

00:46:22.246 --> 00:46:24.648
TO. IT HAS BEEN DONE IN THE PAST

00:46:24.715 --> 00:46:26.450
THAT IT HAS WORKED AND THAT'S

00:46:26.517 --> 00:46:28.685
WHAT SHOULD BE DONE I'M JUST

00:46:28.752 --> 00:46:30.420
ALWAYS VERY CURIOUS ABOUT. I

00:46:30.487 --> 00:46:32.556
DON'T REALLY BUY INTO THAT

00:46:32.623 --> 00:46:33.724
MINDSET JUST BECAUSE WITH THAT

00:46:33.790 --> 00:46:35.592
IN THE PAST YOU KNOW WE'RE GONNA

00:46:35.659 --> 00:46:37.761
CONTINUE TO DO IT I. I LOOK AT

00:46:37.828 --> 00:46:39.496
ALL OF YOUR FEEDBACK IN ALL OF

00:46:39.563 --> 00:46:42.132
YOUR COMMENTS AND I DO. NOT TAKE

00:46:42.199 --> 00:46:44.168
INTO CONSIDERATION THE L. A.

00:46:44.234 --> 00:46:46.937
O.'S COMMENT THAT- THEY LIKE TO

00:46:47.004 --> 00:46:49.273
HAVE IT AB PRIORITY BASED

00:46:49.339 --> 00:46:52.209
APPROACH TO THE FINANCE SO-

00:46:52.276 --> 00:46:53.744
DEPARTMENT FINEST I DISAGREE ON

00:46:53.810 --> 00:46:55.345
THAT AND JUST BECAUSE IT OUT OF

00:46:55.412 --> 00:46:57.881
THE PAST AS I MEAN. YOU KNOW IF

00:46:57.948 --> 00:46:58.916
THE BEST PLAYER OF THE ULTIMATE

00:46:58.982 --> 00:47:01.318
WEIGHT TO DO IT IN THE FUTURE-

00:47:01.385 --> 00:47:03.153
BUT I DO BUT I DO RESPECT BOTH.

00:47:03.220 --> 00:47:05.656
PERSPECTIVE I JUST WANT TO SEE.

00:47:05.722 --> 00:47:07.124
SAID THIS RESPECTFULLY-

00:47:07.191 --> 00:47:11.762
DISAGREE. I MEAN RESPECTFULLY.

00:47:11.828 --> 00:47:12.930
DISAGREE THAT'S- RESEARCH

00:47:12.996 --> 00:47:15.232
DISAGREE ON THAT IN BUT- THANK

00:47:15.299 --> 00:47:17.834

QUESTIONS AND SENATOR MAN LIFE

00:47:21.038 --> 00:47:22.206
TWO QUESTIONS THAT WERE IN THIS

00:47:22.272 --> 00:47:24.208
CATEGORY AND I'M GOING TO ASK

00:47:24.274 --> 00:47:25.642
THEM SEPARATELY AND I THINK SOME

00:47:25.709 --> 00:47:28.612
OF THE- OF THE ITEMS HAVE BEEN

00:47:28.679 --> 00:47:30.847
ADDRESSED ALREADY YOU CAN FEEL

00:47:30.914 --> 00:47:32.149
FREE TO REFER YOURSELF TO

00:47:32.216 --> 00:47:35.319
PREVIOUS ANSWER. AND JUST ADD.

00:47:35.385 --> 00:47:37.688
BUT THE FIRST ONE IS A QUESTION

00:47:37.754 --> 00:47:39.957
FOR ANY WROTE THIS IN THE THIRD

00:47:40.023 --> 00:47:42.226
PERSON SO I'M KIND OF LIKING IT

00:47:42.292 --> 00:47:44.661
ON. ME HE SAYS HE IS CONCERNED

00:47:44.728 --> 00:47:45.862
ABOUT THE PROPOSED TUITION

00:47:45.929 --> 00:47:47.798

IN A MINUTE- YOU SEE IS PLANNING

00:55:21.651 --> 00:55:22.652
TO GROW IN A RESIDENT

00:55:22.719 --> 00:55:24.988
UNDERGRADUATE BERMAN AROUND. TWO

00:55:25.055 --> 00:55:26.089
THOUSAND STUDENTS IN THE BUDGET

00:55:26.156 --> 00:55:27.557
YEAR AND THAT'S INCLUSIVE OF THE

00:55:27.624 --> 00:55:30.126
GROWTH ASSOCIATED WITH THE NON

RESIDENT REDUCTION PLANS.

00:55:31.594 --> 00:55:32.729
ACCORDING TO YOU SEE I WOULD

00:55:32.796 --> 00:55:34.130

IN TWENTY TWENTY TWENTY ONE. SH

00:55:43.139 --> 00:55:43.673
AND GIVEN THAT THE UNIVERSITY

HAS TO RESPECT THOSE

00:55:44.874 --> 00:55:46.743
EXPECTATIONS FOR ITS FALL

00:55:46.810 --> 00:55:47.677
EMISSIONS PLANNING THAT THAT IS

00:55:47.744 --> 00:55:48.945
VERY LIKELY THE MOMENT LEVEL

00:55:49.012 --> 00:55:51.715
THAT WILL OF A ROUGHLYOCCUR AT

00:56:02.525 --> 00:56:04.761
WITH UC'S PLANNED TWO THOUSAND

00:56:04.828 --> 00:56:06.696

ABOUT FORTY THREE MILLION

00:56:07.864 --> 00:56:09.599

WAS OVER THE LEVEL IN TWENTY

01:05:49.345 --> 01:05:50.479
TWENTY TWENTY ONE. AND THE

01:05:50.546 --> 01:05:52.715
LANGUAGE THERE BUT DIDN'T

01:05:52.782 --> 01:05:54.317
SPECIFY THAT IT WAS OVER A

01:05:54.383 --> 01:05:56.886
FUNDED BASELINE OR IF IT

01:05:56.952 --> 01:05:58.521
ASSEMBLY CATION IT WAS OVER SORT

01:05:58.587 --> 01:06:00.122
OF THE ACTUAL LEVEL OF

ABOVE WHAT WAS BUT THEY HAD

01:06:09.065 --> 01:06:11.901
EXPECTED AND A LOT OF THAT WAS

01:06:11.967 --> 01:06:14.804
DRIVEN BY THE PANDEMIC- IN

01:06:14.870 --> 01:06:15.805
DURING THE PANDEMIC THERE IS A

01:06:15.871 --> 01:06:18.407
HUGE GROWTH IN SUMMER ROMANCE

01:06:18.474 --> 01:06:19.975
AND THAT APPEARS TO HAVE BEEN

01:06:20.042 --> 01:06:22.278
DRIVEN BY- YOU KNOW THE

01:06:22.345 --> 01:06:23.679
AVAILABILITY OF ONLINE COURSES

01:06:23.746 --> 01:06:25.014
DURING THE SUMMER OR PERHAPS

01:06:25.081 --> 01:06:26.982
LIMITED EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES

01:06:27.049 --> 01:06:28.851
DURING THE SUMMER. AND THAT AND

01:06:28.918 --> 01:06:29.985
THAT GROWTH HAS PERSISTED INTO

01:06:30.052 --> 01:06:31.754
THE CURRENT YEAR TOO SO IT'S NOT

01:06:31.821 --> 01:06:34.023
LIKE A MOMENT WHEN DOWN THE

01:06:34.090 --> 01:06:35.825
FOLLOWING YEAR. THE UNIVERSITY

01:06:35.891 --> 01:06:37.760

01:06:37.827 --> 01:06:39.829
SIMPLIFY THIS AND SEE IF WE CAN

01:06:39.895 --> 01:06:41.630
GET A TO AN ELEVATOR SPEECH IT

01:06:41.697 --> 01:06:44.834
IS WHAT REALLY HAPPENS IS THAT

01:06:44.900 --> 01:06:47.770
UC'S INTERPRETING WHAT THE

01:06:47.837 --> 01:06:52.708
BASELINE WAS A VOTE FOR THE

01:06:52.775 --> 01:06:53.309
SIXTY FIVE HUNDRED OR WHATEVER

01:06:53.376 --> 01:06:55.778
THAT IT ADDITIONAL FUNDED GROWTH

01:06:55.845 --> 01:06:57.380
A DIFFERENT THAN WHAT MIGHT HAVE

01:06:57.446 --> 01:06:59.882
BEEN OR INTENT OR WHAT WE MIGHT

01:06:59.949 --> 01:07:02.685
HAVE THOUGHT WHEN WE DID IT- IT

01:07:02.752 --> 01:07:04.587
IS IT THAT. WE WERE REALLY

01:07:04.653 --> 01:07:06.355
LOOKING FOR SIXTY FIVE HUNDRED

01:07:06.422 --> 01:07:08.090
OVER THE CURRENT GROWTH AND DAY

01:07:08.157 --> 01:07:09.358
ADMITTED MMHM WELL IS THERE A

01:07:09.425 --> 01:07:10.526
MOMENT WAS HIGHER THAN I THOUGHT

01:07:10.593 --> 01:07:12.795
IT WAS GOING TO BE WHEN THEY DID

01:07:12.862 --> 01:07:13.596
THE ADMITTED TO THEY'RE DOING IT

THINK AS WE MOVE TOWARD THE MAY

01:09:53.255 --> 01:09:56.058
REVISE WE WOULD LIKE TO SEEK

01:09:56.125 --> 01:09:58.694
CLARITY. IN OUR HOW WE

01:09:58.761 --> 01:10:01.463
DESIGNATE- OTHER. THAN ROMAN AND

01:10:01.530 --> 01:10:04.833
I KNOW THAT THAT WE USUALLY.

01:10:04.900 --> 01:10:06.835
LIKE TO MAXIMIZE THE FUNDING AND

01:10:06.902 --> 01:10:09.138
SO I'M SURE WE WOULD LOVE TO

01:10:09.204 --> 01:10:10.806
FIGURE OUT A WAY WHAT WE THOUGHT

01:10:10.873 --> 01:10:13.442
OUR INTENT WAS IS LIFT WITH BUT

01:10:13.509 --> 01:10:15.177
I ACCEPT THE FACT THAT THERE'S

01:10:15.244 --> 01:10:17.313
COMPLEXITY TO THIS. AND I THINK

01:10:17.379 --> 01:10:18.047
WE SHOULD JUST HAVE

01:10:18.113 --> 01:10:20.683
CONVERSATIONS GOING FORWARD AND

01:10:20.749 --> 01:10:23.319
I DON'T FEEL READY TO. EXCEPT

01:10:23.385 --> 01:10:26.722
THE WHAT HAPPENED. I THINK WE

01:10:26.789 --> 01:10:28.757
JUST HAVE TO LOOK AT IT AND HAVE

01:10:28.824 --> 01:10:30.426
CONVERSATIONS OVER THE NEXT FEW

01:10:30.492 --> 01:10:33.562
MONTHS. THEN LET ME- ASK A FEW

01:10:33.629 --> 01:10:37.433
QUESTIONS. AND ONE IS FOR THE

01:10:37.499 --> 01:10:40.035
UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA. IT WAS

01:10:40.102 --> 01:10:41.670
MENTIONED I THINK IN YOUR

01:10:41.737 --> 01:10:43.839
COMMENTS THAT YOU WORK TO KEEP

01:10:43.906 --> 01:10:45.374
UP WITH THE F. ACADEMIC

01:10:45.441 --> 01:10:47.576
INFRASTRUCTURE I KNOW I TALK TO

01:10:47.643 --> 01:10:49.078
PEOPLE ON SOME CAMPUSES THAT

01:10:49.144 --> 01:10:50.479
DON'T FEEL LIKE THAT IS

01:10:50.546 --> 01:10:54.450
HAPPENING SO HOW DO YOU ENSURE.

01:10:54.516 --> 01:10:56.151
THAT YOU ADD THE ADDITIONAL AND

01:10:56.218 --> 01:10:57.853
ROMAN AND THAT THERE IS A

01:10:57.920 --> 01:11:01.123
CORRESPONDING INCREASE OF

01:11:01.190 --> 01:11:04.193
ACADEMIC INFRASTRUCTURE THAT IS

01:11:04.259 --> 01:11:06.061
THE NEED FOR WHICH IS CREATED BY

01:11:06.128 --> 01:11:07.830
THE ADDITIONAL MOMENT HOW DO YOU

01:11:07.896 --> 01:11:11.800
MAKE SURE THAT HAPPENS. THANK

01:11:11.867 --> 01:11:13.869
YOU FOR THE QUESTION SENATOR OUR

01:11:13.936 --> 01:11:15.804
CAMPUSES HAVE LONG RANGE

01:11:15.871 --> 01:11:18.073
DEVELOPMENT PLANS WHICH SET

01:11:18.140 --> 01:11:20.142
GUIDANCE FOR HOW THE CAMPUS

01:11:20.209 --> 01:11:23.445
SHOULD- DEVELOP INFRASTRUCTURE

01:11:23.512 --> 01:11:26.482
TO MATCH NEW STUDENT GROSS. OR

01:11:26.548 --> 01:11:28.150
TO GUIDE NEW STUDENT GROWTH- IN

01:11:28.217 --> 01:11:29.985
ADDITION THE REGENTS APPROVE A

01:11:30.052 --> 01:11:31.387
FIVE YEAR INFRASTRUCTURE PLAN

01:11:31.453 --> 01:11:34.056
ANNUALLY. THAT SPECIFIES THE

01:11:34.123 --> 01:11:35.824
PROJECTS OF WE WOULD LIKE TO ASK

01:11:35.891 --> 01:11:39.762
THE SYSTEM CONSTRUCT NEXT- IN

01:11:39.828 --> 01:11:41.497
TERMS OF ACTUALLY IMPLEMENTING

01:11:41.563 --> 01:11:43.832
THESE PROJECTS THE UNIVERSITY

01:11:43.899 --> 01:11:46.068
HAS NOT HAD A GENERAL OBLIGATION

01:11:46.135 --> 01:11:49.304
BOND SINCE TWO THOUSAND AND SIX.

01:11:49.371 --> 01:11:51.373
WE HAVE BEEN USING OUR OWN

01:11:51.440 --> 01:11:54.143
INTERNAL FINANCING MECHANISMS TO

01:11:54.209 --> 01:11:57.680
FIND NEW PROJECT CONSTRUCTION-

01:11:57.746 --> 01:11:59.548
BUT WHAT THIS MEANS IS THAT WE

01:11:59.615 --> 01:12:03.085
CAN ONLY FIND A FEW PROJECTS

01:12:03.152 --> 01:12:04.787
ANNUALLY. SO THE THIRD THE

01:12:04.853 --> 01:12:06.855
PROGRESS IN DEVELOPING NEW

01:12:06.922 --> 01:12:09.625
BUILDINGS ON CAMPUSES IS SLOW

01:12:09.692 --> 01:12:11.694
BECAUSE WE ARE LIMITED IN HOW

01:12:11.760 --> 01:12:13.595
MUCH FINANCING WE HAVE ACCESS

01:12:13.662 --> 01:12:18.200
TO- WE WILL BE PROVIDING THE

01:12:18.267 --> 01:12:19.635
LEGISLATURE WITH ADDITIONAL

01:12:19.702 --> 01:12:22.104
CAPITAL OUTLAY REQUESTS. AND WE

01:12:22.171 --> 01:12:23.939
ALSO HAVE THE REGION'S FIVE YEAR

01:12:24.006 --> 01:12:26.508
PLAN IF YOU WANT TO GO THROUGH

01:12:26.575 --> 01:12:28.210
IT AND SELECT SOME PROJECTS THAT

01:12:28.277 --> 01:12:30.379
SEEM. LIKE SOMETHING THE

01:12:30.446 --> 01:12:32.381
LEGISLATURE MIGHT WANT TO FIND-

01:12:32.448 --> 01:12:35.718
BUT OUR FOR OUR REQUEST IS- THAT

01:12:35.784 --> 01:12:37.453
WE ARE GOING TO BE PROVIDING

01:12:37.519 --> 01:12:40.289
VERY SOON IS FOR ONE POINT SIX

01:12:40.355 --> 01:12:42.491
BILLION DOLLARS FOR DEFERRED

01:12:42.558 --> 01:12:44.760
MAINTENANCE NEW INFRASTRUCTURE

01:12:44.827 --> 01:12:46.662
SEISMIC RENOVATION OF BUILDINGS

01:12:46.729 --> 01:12:50.833
AND SOME NEW ACADEMIC SPACE. ARM

01:12:50.899 --> 01:12:52.901
I JUST HAVE TO COMMENT ON TO AT

01:12:52.968 --> 01:12:55.804
THE END IT'S BECAUSE YOU WERE

01:12:55.871 --> 01:12:57.806
BASICALLY PUTTING IT BACK ON US

01:12:57.873 --> 01:12:59.141
AND OF COURSE I SUPPORT THE

01:12:59.208 --> 01:13:01.610
BUILDINGS ARE SUPPORTED BOND.

01:13:01.677 --> 01:13:04.146
AND EVERYTHING BUT- WHEN WE'RE

01:13:04.213 --> 01:13:05.981
DISCUSSING INCREASED ENROLLMENTS

01:13:06.048 --> 01:13:07.483
AND WHEN YOUR LONG RANGE

01:13:07.549 --> 01:13:09.218
DEVELOPMENT PLANS ARE PUT

01:13:09.284 --> 01:13:11.587
FORWARD IT SAYS STUDENTS ARE

01:13:11.653 --> 01:13:13.989
ACCEPTED AND THEN IT'S LIKE WELL

01:13:14.056 --> 01:13:16.425
IT'S ON US TO HAVE THE

01:13:16.492 --> 01:13:18.627
FACILITIES. HE IS THE STUDENTS

01:13:18.694 --> 01:13:24.399
WERE WERE OUR ACCEPTED AND SO IT

01:13:24.466 --> 01:13:26.401
SEEMS LIKE IT'S THE IT'S THE

01:13:26.468 --> 01:13:27.703
PROBLEM WITH THE LONG RANGE

01:13:27.770 --> 01:13:29.671
DEVELOPMENT PLANS THERE WAS A

01:13:29.738 --> 01:13:31.507
HUGE DISAGREEMENT OVER THE ONE

01:13:31.573 --> 01:13:34.042
IN SANTA CRUZ WHICH IS MY HOME

01:13:34.109 --> 01:13:35.911
CAMPUS. AND IT WAS A

01:13:35.978 --> 01:13:39.047
DISAGREEMENT OVER THE FAX. AND

01:13:39.114 --> 01:13:40.749
SOME OF THE ADVOCATES CONTENDED

01:13:40.816 --> 01:13:43.118
THAT A 100% OF THE ENROLLMENT

01:13:43.185 --> 01:13:46.255
WAS ADMITTED AND THAT 7% OF THE

01:13:46.321 --> 01:13:48.257
NON ENROLLMENT COMMITMENTS WERE

01:13:48.323 --> 01:13:50.559
MADE THE UNIVERSITY DISAGREE

01:13:50.626 --> 01:13:54.062
STRENUOUSLY AND SAYS IT WAS A

01:13:54.129 --> 01:13:55.264
100% OF THE- OF THE ENROLLMENT

01:13:55.330 --> 01:13:57.566
AND IT WAS CLOSE TO A 100% OF

01:13:57.633 --> 01:13:59.701
THE FACILITIES CAME WITH IT. BUT

01:13:59.768 --> 01:14:04.239
IT'S WHY THE LEGISLATURE IN TWO

01:14:04.306 --> 01:14:05.541
THOUSAND SIX IN CONJUNCTION WITH

01:14:05.607 --> 01:14:08.610
THE LAST BOND. ADOPTED LANGUAGE

01:14:08.677 --> 01:14:11.113
THAT SAID. HE WOULD NOT BE

01:14:11.180 --> 01:14:13.081
ELIGIBLE FOR THE NEXT BUILDING

01:14:13.148 --> 01:14:14.817
IN A BOND UNTIL YOU MITIGATED

01:14:14.883 --> 01:14:16.151
THE IMPACTS FROM THE

01:14:16.218 --> 01:14:17.719
CONSTRUCTION OF THE PREVIOUS

01:14:17.786 --> 01:14:19.388
BONTA BECAUSE FREQUENTLY THE

01:14:19.454 --> 01:14:20.689
UNIVERSITY WOULD ASK FOR THE

01:14:20.756 --> 01:14:21.857
COST OF THE BUILDING AND SO WE

01:14:21.924 --> 01:14:23.725
DON'T HAVE THE MONEY FOR THE-

01:14:23.792 --> 01:14:25.394
FOR THE MITIGATION. AND I THINK

01:14:25.460 --> 01:14:27.629
THE SAME THING APPLIES HERE AND

01:14:27.696 --> 01:14:29.865
I THOUGHT THE SOLUTION. TO THE

01:14:29.932 --> 01:14:32.701
CONTENTIOUS LRCP IN SANTA CRUZ

01:14:32.768 --> 01:14:34.903
LONG RANGE DEVELOPMENT PAN. WAS

01:14:34.970 --> 01:14:40.342
THAT IT'S FINE TO PROJECT-

01:14:40.409 --> 01:14:40.943
SIXTEEN THOUSAND MORE STUDENTS

01:14:41.009 --> 01:14:42.878
OVER TWENTY YEARS OR WHATEVER IT

01:14:42.945 --> 01:14:45.347
WAS. BUT DID YOU WOULD NOT

01:14:45.414 --> 01:14:47.783
ADVANCE TO DIFFERENT LEVELS OF

01:14:47.850 --> 01:14:50.018
ENROLLMENT VENTO YOU COMMITTED

01:14:50.085 --> 01:14:51.753
TO ADVANCE TO DIFFERENT ROMANCE

01:14:51.820 --> 01:14:53.655
OF THE ACADEMIC AND PHYSICAL

01:14:53.722 --> 01:14:56.925
INFRASTRUCTURE IN A PHASE FOR

01:14:56.992 --> 01:14:59.027
THAT ENROLLMENT GOING. THAT JUST

01:14:59.094 --> 01:15:00.462
DOESN'T SEEM RIGHT TO SAY WELL

01:15:00.529 --> 01:15:01.630
YOU GUYS DIDN'T FUNDED SO WE'RE

01:15:01.697 --> 01:15:03.665
JUST GONNA TAKE TO STUDENTS AND

01:15:03.732 --> 01:15:05.434
WE WON'T HAVE THE INFRASTRUCTURE

01:15:05.500 --> 01:15:07.269
TO DO IT THERE HAS TO BE A

01:15:07.336 --> 01:15:11.206
BETTER WAY. OF DOING IT AND I

01:15:11.273 --> 01:15:12.441
KNOW. EVEN THOUGH IT'S NOT ON

01:15:12.507 --> 01:15:14.877
OUR AGENDA THERE ARE PROPOSALS

01:15:14.943 --> 01:15:16.678
FOR A BOND. AND THE DIFFERENCE

01:15:16.745 --> 01:15:18.814
BETWEEN THE TWO HOUSES RIGHT NOW

01:15:18.881 --> 01:15:20.482
VISIT THE SENATE IS INTERESTED

01:15:20.549 --> 01:15:23.185
IN INCLUDING HIGHER EDUCATION

01:15:23.252 --> 01:15:24.653
BUT THE ASSEMBLY PROPOSAL DOES

01:15:24.720 --> 01:15:25.988
NOT. AND I HAPPENED TO SEE

01:15:26.054 --> 01:15:27.789
PRIVATE POLLING THAT SHOWS.

01:15:27.856 --> 01:15:29.591
THERE'S MORE SUPPORT FOR THE K.

01:15:29.658 --> 01:15:30.525
THROUGH TWELVE THEY'RE STILL

01:15:30.592 --> 01:15:32.160
SUPPORT FOR HIGHER EDUCATION BUT

01:15:32.227 --> 01:15:33.896
WE HAVE TO NAVIGATE THAT BUT IT

01:15:33.962 --> 01:15:37.099
IT. IT JUST IT IS A BONE OF

01:15:37.165 --> 01:15:40.435
CONTENTION AND SO- I THINK THOSE

01:15:40.502 --> 01:15:43.572
LONG RANGE PLANS ONLY GO SO FAR

01:15:43.639 --> 01:15:44.907
RIGHT NOW IT'S WHAT'S GOING TO

01:15:44.973 --> 01:15:46.475
HAPPEN BUT THERE'S NO COMMITMENT

01:15:46.541 --> 01:15:48.710
TO MAKE IT HAPPEN AND- AND TO

01:15:48.777 --> 01:15:50.312
CONNECT THE ENROLLMENT WITH THE

01:15:50.379 --> 01:15:51.480
ACADEMIC OR PHYSICAL

01:15:51.546 --> 01:15:54.516
INFRASTRUCTURE IN INCREMENTS.

01:15:54.583 --> 01:15:57.052
BUT THAT THAT LEADS TO THE- THE

01:15:57.119 --> 01:16:00.289
OTHER TWO QUESTIONS I HAVE BEEN

01:16:00.355 --> 01:16:01.290
MAYBE. MAYBE WE SHOULD TALK

01:16:01.356 --> 01:16:02.991
ABOUT ONE OF THEM UNDER HOUSING

01:16:03.058 --> 01:16:04.559
BUT BUT- THE UNIVERSITY OF

01:16:04.626 --> 01:16:06.228
CALIFORNIA AT SANTA CRUZ HAS

01:16:06.295 --> 01:16:07.763
SAID IN THEIR LATEST LONG RANGE

01:16:07.829 --> 01:16:09.298
DEVELOPMENT PLAN AND- THEY WILL

01:16:09.364 --> 01:16:12.734
NOT. THAT NEW HOUSING WILL COVER

01:16:12.801 --> 01:16:15.871
ALL NEW STUDENTS A. AND SORT OF

01:16:15.938 --> 01:16:18.140
BUT- I CAN'T TELL IF THERE'S AN

01:16:18.206 --> 01:16:20.909
ENFORCEMENT MECHANISM SO. SO HOW

01:16:20.976 --> 01:16:23.979
DOES THAT WORK. HOW WILL WORK TO

01:16:24.046 --> 01:16:26.048
MEET THE TERMS OF THE OUR T. PAY

01:16:26.114 --> 01:16:28.083
THAT THE KNOWN ROMAN CROSS WON'T

01:16:28.150 --> 01:16:31.219
HAPPEN UNLESS THERE'S HOUSING.

01:16:31.286 --> 01:16:33.989
AND THAT'S TO UC. THANK YOU FOR

01:16:34.056 --> 01:16:35.791
THE QUESTION SIR I THINK IT'S

01:16:35.857 --> 01:16:37.559
IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER THAT OUR

01:16:37.626 --> 01:16:39.328
RD PEACE ARE KIND OF GUIDANCE

01:16:39.394 --> 01:16:41.830
DOCUMENTS. AND THAT THEY ARE NOT

01:16:41.897 --> 01:16:46.201
INTENDED TO- STRICTLY SAY YEAR

01:16:46.268 --> 01:16:48.737
TO YEAR HOW GROSS WILL OCCUR. IN

01:16:48.804 --> 01:16:50.839
ADDITION- WE GET. OUR

01:16:50.906 --> 01:16:53.709
INVOLVEMENT GROSS NUMBERS FROM.

01:16:53.775 --> 01:16:55.911
THE LEGISLATURE AND THAT

01:16:55.978 --> 01:16:57.679
ENROLLMENT GROWTH CAN OCCUR

01:16:57.746 --> 01:16:59.681
WITHIN A SINGLE YEAR. BUT IT

01:16:59.748 --> 01:17:02.718
TAKES A THREE YEARS SOMETIMES

01:17:02.784 --> 01:17:06.221
LONGER TO BUILD A NEW BUILDING

01:17:06.288 --> 01:17:09.191
TO ACCOMMODATE GROWTH SO. THE

01:17:09.257 --> 01:17:11.259
ACADEMIC BUILDING SPACE ARE

01:17:11.326 --> 01:17:14.296
ADDITIONS AND IN ROMAN GROWS ARE

01:17:14.363 --> 01:17:16.398
MOVING ON PARALLEL TRACKS BUT

01:17:16.465 --> 01:17:19.334
NOT ALWAYS AND- STEADY

01:17:19.401 --> 01:17:22.437
ALIGNMENT- CAPITAL SPACE IS

01:17:22.504 --> 01:17:25.874
OFTEN A LAGGING. INDICATOR TO

01:17:25.941 --> 01:17:30.212
THE ENROLLMENT GROSS- THE CAMPUS

01:17:30.278 --> 01:17:31.813
OF CENTER IF THEY ARE ABLE TO

01:17:31.880 --> 01:17:34.916
CONSTRUCT THEIR NEW FACILITIES-

01:17:34.983 --> 01:17:36.385
THEY WILL BE ABLE TO ACCOMMODATE

01:17:36.451 --> 01:17:38.553
THE ENROLLMENT GROSS THAT THEY

01:17:38.620 --> 01:17:40.622
WANT TO TAKE ON THAT CAMPUS- BUT

01:17:40.689 --> 01:17:42.958
THAT ABILITY FOR THAT CAMPUS TO

01:17:43.025 --> 01:17:44.192
MOVE FORWARD WITH THOSE NEW

01:17:44.259 --> 01:17:47.963
PROJECTS. IS OF COURSE DEPENDENT

01:17:48.030 --> 01:17:50.932
ON A MULTITUDE OF FACTORS. I

01:17:50.999 --> 01:17:55.604
AGREE BUT IT IT IS ALWAYS. A

01:17:55.670 --> 01:17:57.339
WHAT WAS JUST REFERRED TO AS A

01:17:57.406 --> 01:17:59.107
GUIDANCE DOCUMENT IS NOT

01:17:59.174 --> 01:18:01.076
ACCEPTED ALL THE TIME BY COURTS

01:18:01.143 --> 01:18:02.711
AS BEING A GUIDE GUIDANCE

01:18:02.778 --> 01:18:05.213
DOCUMENT- ARE THERE LOOKING FOR

01:18:05.280 --> 01:18:07.916
ACTUAL. IMPLEMENTATION AND I

01:18:07.983 --> 01:18:11.386

01:18:11.453 --> 01:18:14.723
DIFFICULT RELATIONS WITH OTHER

01:18:14.790 --> 01:18:18.226

01:18:19.895 --> 01:18:21.797
GUIDANCE DOCUMENT. AND THEREFORE

01:18:21.863 --> 01:18:23.065
THINGS WILL HAPPEN THAT AREN'T

01:18:23.131 --> 01:18:26.201

POSSIBLE STUDENT HOUSING FUNDING

01:20:45.106 --> 01:20:46.575
MECHANISMS. THAT WOULD ALLOW TO

01:20:46.641 --> 01:20:47.776
UNIVERSITY TO ACCESS THE

01:20:47.842 --> 01:20:50.412
FINANCING NECESSARY TO CONSTRUCT

01:20:50.478 --> 01:20:59.621

STANISLAUS STATE THEY'RE GOING

01:21:05.994 --> 01:21:08.597
TO DO A CENTERED STOCKTON THAT

01:21:08.663 --> 01:21:10.098
WAS FUNDED BY THE LEGISLATURE

01:21:10.165 --> 01:21:12.701
LAST YEAR THAT WHILE COMMITTED

01:21:12.767 --> 01:21:14.536

COLLEGE ACQUISITION WHICH SEEMS

01:21:20.642 --> 01:21:22.110
LIKE IT MIGHT HAVE PROBLEMS

01:21:22.177 --> 01:21:24.613
THESE DAYS BUT IT SEEMS TO ME

PERMEATE BECAUSE I ACTUALLY HAVE

01:22:01.082 --> 01:22:04.819
ABOUT. I'VE ACTUALLY WE THINK

01:22:04.886 --> 01:22:06.721
HOW DO I. THERE WERE THE

01:22:06.788 --> 01:22:07.956
UNIVERSE TO HAVE A CERTAIN

01:22:08.023 --> 01:22:12.794
AMOUNT OF GROWTH AND AB AND IT.

01:22:12.861 --> 01:22:14.095
BASICALLY PLACE IT ON THE

01:22:14.162 --> 01:22:18.099
UNIVERSITIES TO FACILITATE THE

01:22:18.166 --> 01:22:20.468
INFRASTRUCTURE BOTH WITH HE AT

01:22:20.535 --> 01:22:22.937
TEACHER AND THE INFRASTRUCTURE

01:22:23.004 --> 01:22:24.439
AND I TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION IS

01:22:24.506 --> 01:22:25.774
THINKING ABOUT AND THE REASON I

01:22:25.840 --> 01:22:27.542
WAS THINKING ABOUT IT I WAS

01:22:27.609 --> 01:22:30.445
THINKING ABOUT THE- THE- MY

01:22:30.512 --> 01:22:32.914
GOODNESS I JUST. LOST MY TRAIN

01:22:32.981 --> 01:22:36.551
OF THOUGHT THE- THE DEFER THEIR

01:22:36.618 --> 01:22:39.487
DEFERRED MAINTENANCE COST OF THE

01:22:39.554 --> 01:22:41.589
INFRASTRUCTURE THAT IS JUST. IN

01:22:41.656 --> 01:22:43.158
MY OPINION JUST GROWING

01:22:43.224 --> 01:22:44.326
EXPONENTIALLY IN BUT WE'RE

01:22:44.392 --> 01:22:45.760
ALLOCATING TOWARDS A DEFERRED

01:22:45.827 --> 01:22:48.630
PAYMENT AND I THOUGHT WE'RE NOT

01:22:48.697 --> 01:22:50.598
MAINTAINING THE STRUCTURES AND-

01:22:50.665 --> 01:22:51.633
FOR THE DAY INTERPRETERS THAT WE

01:22:51.700 --> 01:22:54.135
CURRENTLY HAVE. HOW DO WE EXPECT

01:22:54.202 --> 01:22:56.604
THAT THESE STUDENTS TO COME IN

01:22:56.671 --> 01:23:00.208
AND ACTUALLY- HAVE BOTH TEACHERS

01:23:00.275 --> 01:23:02.177
AND CLASSES COURSES OFFERED IN A

01:23:02.243 --> 01:23:03.278
FACILITY TO ATTEND BUT I CAN

01:23:03.345 --> 01:23:05.513
UNDERSTAND THE ONLINE ENROLLMENT

01:23:05.580 --> 01:23:08.049
PROCESS AND HOW THAT WOULD BE

01:23:08.116 --> 01:23:10.652
BENEFICIAL- IN. IN MITIGATING

01:23:10.719 --> 01:23:13.021
THE NEW AND ROMAN BUT- I AM

01:23:13.088 --> 01:23:14.522
STILL VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THE

01:23:14.589 --> 01:23:17.125
DEFERRED MAINTENANCE- ASPECT OF

01:23:17.192 --> 01:23:19.527
OUR UNIVERSITIES- OUR WHOLE

01:23:19.594 --> 01:23:20.028
INFRASTRUCTURE ACTUALLY

01:23:20.095 --> 01:23:21.563
THROUGHOUT YOU KNOW OUR OUR

01:23:21.629 --> 01:23:24.899
FROM. K. ALL THE WAY TO. OUR OUR

01:23:24.966 --> 01:23:26.868
UNIVERSITIES AND THEY THE FOR

01:23:26.935 --> 01:23:28.636
PAYMENTS ARE DUE FOR MAINTENANCE

01:23:28.703 --> 01:23:31.639
ON THAT ASPECT SO. MY CONCERN

01:23:31.706 --> 01:23:34.309
WAS WERE EXPECTING THESE

01:23:34.376 --> 01:23:36.811
UNIVERSITIES TO ENROLL AN X.

01:23:36.878 --> 01:23:38.780
AMOUNT OF STUDENTS. AND YET

01:23:38.847 --> 01:23:40.815
WE'RE NOT OUT ARE WE'RE NOT OUT

01:23:40.882 --> 01:23:43.618
OF ALLOTTING. A SPECIFIC AMOUNT

01:23:43.685 --> 01:23:46.221
ARE ENOUGH IN MY OPINION- TO THE

01:23:46.287 --> 01:23:47.622
DEFERRED MAINTENANCE RICHEST

01:23:47.689 --> 01:23:49.557
INFRASTRUCTURE BUT THEN AGAIN. I

01:23:49.624 --> 01:23:57.198
TOOK NOTE IN HERE THAT- THE NEAR

01:23:57.265 --> 01:23:58.800
ROMAN FUNDING WOULD GO TOWARDS

01:23:58.867 --> 01:24:01.836
NEW HIRING WHICH WOULD BE

01:24:01.903 --> 01:24:03.772
HELPFUL IN COURSE- AVAILABILITY

01:24:03.838 --> 01:24:05.473
BECAUSE THAT IS ONE OF THE

01:24:05.540 --> 01:24:06.775
CONCERNS THAT I OFTEN ALSO HERE

01:24:06.841 --> 01:24:09.043
IS THAT OUR STUDENTS DON'T HAVE

01:24:09.110 --> 01:24:11.413
COURSE. AT COURSES THAT THEY

01:24:11.479 --> 01:24:13.448
HAVE ACCESS TO IN ORDER TO BE

01:24:13.515 --> 01:24:15.183
ABLE TO GRADUATE SO. IN THE BACK

01:24:15.250 --> 01:24:17.018
OF A MIND THING HOW DO WE

01:24:17.085 --> 01:24:19.020
MITIGATE THAT HOW DO WE EXPECT

01:24:19.087 --> 01:24:21.423
YOU TO GROW. BUT YET. THERE

01:24:21.489 --> 01:24:22.757
ISN'T THERE DOESN'T SEEM TO BE

01:24:22.824 --> 01:24:24.793
CURRENTLY ENOUGH CLASSES OUR

01:24:24.859 --> 01:24:27.262

01:24:27.328 --> 01:24:29.431
TO HAVE THE ABILITY TO GRADUATE

01:24:29.497 --> 01:24:30.865

01:27:47.929 --> 01:27:49.130
ESTIMATES IT WOULD HAVE TO SPEND

01:27:49.197 --> 01:27:50.498
AROUND ONE POINT TWO BILLION

MILLION ANNUALLY ON MAINTENANCE.

01:28:02.443 --> 01:28:02.844

ISSUE- WE RAISE CONCERNS WITH

01:37:27.474 --> 01:37:28.609
JUST ONE PROPOSAL AND THAT IS

01:37:28.676 --> 01:37:30.911

NOTED OF THE STATE HAS PROVIDED

01:37:44.425 --> 01:37:45.593
ONE TIME FUNDING IN PREVIOUS

01:37:45.659 --> 01:37:46.560
YEARS FOR THE CENTER ARE

01:37:46.627 --> 01:37:48.662
PRIMARILY AROUND A DEVELOPING

01:37:48.729 --> 01:37:52.866
NEW SCREENING TOOLS THAT- OFF A

01:37:52.933 --> 01:37:54.034
FLAG REALLY INDICATIONS OF

01:37:54.101 --> 01:37:55.603
LEARNING CHALLENGES AMONG

01:37:55.669 --> 01:37:56.503
KINDERGARTEN AND FIRST GRADE

01:37:56.570 --> 01:37:58.872
STUDENTS- THE IDEA HERE IS THAT

01:37:58.939 --> 01:38:00.374
THE SCREENING TOOLS WILL ALLOW

01:38:00.441 --> 01:38:01.942
FOR EARLY INTERVENTIONS. ARE

01:38:02.009 --> 01:38:03.677
POTENTIALLY IMPROVING-

01:38:03.744 --> 01:38:04.845
EDUCATIONAL OUTCOMES FOR

01:38:04.912 --> 01:38:06.413
STUDENTS IN THE LONG RUN AND

01:38:06.480 --> 01:38:07.915
EVEN POTENTIALLY PREVENTING SOME

01:38:07.982 --> 01:38:10.117
STUDENTS FROM HAVING TO BE

01:38:10.184 --> 01:38:12.453
REFERRED FOR SPECIAL EDUCATION.

01:38:12.519 --> 01:38:14.054
THIS OVERALL OBJECTIVE- SEEMS

01:38:14.121 --> 01:38:15.656
REASONABLE TO US- BUT WE'RE

01:38:15.723 --> 01:38:18.525
CONCERNED WITH SOME OF THE

01:38:18.592 --> 01:38:19.026
SPECIFIC ELEMENTS OF THE

01:38:19.093 --> 01:38:21.228
PROPOSAL. FRANKLY WE'RE

01:38:21.295 --> 01:38:23.764
CONCERNED THAT THE I TO DATE THE

01:38:23.831 --> 01:38:25.566
LEGISLATURE REALLY HASN'T SET

01:38:25.633 --> 01:38:27.735
STATUTORY- GUIDELINES ARE

01:38:27.801 --> 01:38:29.236
FRAMEWORK AROUND THE INITIATIVE

01:38:29.303 --> 01:38:31.238
IT'S REALLY BEEN DRIVEN BY THE

01:38:31.305 --> 01:38:32.106
ADMINISTRATION AND THE

01:38:32.172 --> 01:38:34.942
UNIVERSITY. AND WE'RE CONCERNED

01:38:35.009 --> 01:38:36.277
THAT WITHOUT SOME GUIDELINES THE

01:38:36.343 --> 01:38:37.911
LEGISLATURE COULD RUN THE RISK

01:38:37.978 --> 01:38:39.847
OF FACING UP UNLESS YOU LIVE

01:38:39.913 --> 01:38:41.081
WITH. A GROWING SCOPE AND

01:38:41.148 --> 01:38:43.384
GROWING COSTS THAT IT DIDN'T

01:38:43.450 --> 01:38:45.552
NECESSARILY INTEND TO COMMIT TO

01:38:45.619 --> 01:38:47.288
- OF FOR THE PROPOSED- FUNDING

01:38:47.354 --> 01:38:48.722
IN THIS YEAR'S BUDGET- YOU CAN

01:38:48.789 --> 01:38:50.524
TURN TO PAGE TWENTY ONE THE

01:38:50.591 --> 01:38:52.626
FIGURE ON THAT. IT SHOWS HOW THE

01:38:52.693 --> 01:38:54.962
CENTER WOULD BE- SPEND THE FUNDS

01:38:55.029 --> 01:38:57.331
AND EVEN SUSPENDED YOUR PLAN-

01:38:57.398 --> 01:38:58.532
YOU KNOW THERE DOES SEEM TO BE A

01:38:58.599 --> 01:39:00.301
BIT OF A BROAD IN SCOPE- THE-

01:39:00.367 --> 01:39:01.335
PLAN IS TO ADD MORE

01:39:01.402 --> 01:39:03.370
FUNCTIONALITY TO THE- ABSURD

01:39:03.437 --> 01:39:05.306
EXISTING TOOLS IN PLACE. AND

01:39:05.372 --> 01:39:08.842
THEN ALSO TO. FUND OTHER

01:39:08.909 --> 01:39:10.844
ACTIVITIES LIKE BASIC RESEARCH.

01:39:10.911 --> 01:39:12.079
OUR SECOND CONCERN IS THE

01:39:12.146 --> 01:39:13.180
ADMINISTRATION TO DATE HASN'T

01:39:13.247 --> 01:39:15.082
PROVIDED THE LEGISLATURE A LONG

01:39:15.149 --> 01:39:19.386
TERM PLAN TO SCALE- THE- POLLS.

01:39:19.453 --> 01:39:20.688
THE LEGISLATURE REALLY DOESN'T

01:39:20.754 --> 01:39:22.256
HAVE A GOOD SENSE OF WHAT THE

01:39:22.323 --> 01:39:25.592
LONG TERM PLAN IS TO. IMPLEMENT

01:39:25.659 --> 01:39:27.761
THE CENTERS SCHOOLS STATEWIDE-

01:39:27.828 --> 01:39:30.264
AND ALSO DISCUSS UNIT COSTS WITH

01:39:30.331 --> 01:39:31.765
FURTHER DEVELOPMENT WITH

PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT FOR

01:39:32.700 --> 01:39:35.636

01:39:35.703 --> 01:39:37.171
RECOMMEND OF THE LEGISLATURE IS

01:39:37.237 --> 01:39:37.905

01:48:08.949 --> 01:48:10.650
THAT FOCUS ON AGRICULTURAL AND

01:48:10.717 --> 01:48:12.452
NATURAL RESOURCE ISSUES THE

01:48:12.519 --> 01:48:13.920
FIRST IS CALLED THE AGRICULTURAL

01:48:13.987 --> 01:48:15.922
EXPERIMENT STATIONS THIS

01:48:15.989 --> 01:48:18.692
PROVIDES BASIC RESEARCH. ON THAT

01:48:18.758 --> 01:48:20.160
THREE UC CAMPUSES ON

01:48:20.227 --> 01:48:20.794
AGRICULTURAL AND NATURAL

01:48:20.861 --> 01:48:22.629
RESOURCE ISSUES. AND THE SECOND

01:48:22.696 --> 01:48:24.130
PROGRAM IS CALLED COOPERATIVE

01:48:24.197 --> 01:48:25.932
EXTENSION THIS IS MORE ENGAGED

01:48:25.999 --> 01:48:27.234
IN TRANSLATIONAL APPLIED

01:48:27.300 --> 01:48:28.969
RESEARCH AND ALSO DIRECT

ACTIVITIES ACROSS MANY COMMUNITY

01:48:33.940 --> 01:48:36.977
BASED SITES AND ON UC CAMPUSES

01:48:37.043 --> 01:48:38.812
THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA. BUT YOU

01:48:38.879 --> 01:48:40.180
CAN IMAGINE THE TWO PROGRAMS ARE

01:48:40.247 --> 01:48:41.982
INTENDED TO WORK TOGETHER WITH

01:48:42.048 --> 01:48:42.949
THE AGRICULTURE EXPERIMENT

01:48:43.016 --> 01:48:44.417
STATION IS REALLY FOCUSED ON

01:48:44.484 --> 01:48:45.852

INTO THEIR BROADER COMMUNITY

01:48:55.095 --> 01:48:58.098
ACROSS THE STATE. I'M I'M JUST

01:48:58.164 --> 01:48:59.199
ANOTHER ASPECT ABOUT THESE

01:48:59.266 --> 01:49:00.267
PROGRAMS TO KEEP IN MIND OF

ON THE PROGRAM TOO SO I THINK WE

01:56:23.643 --> 01:56:24.977

FOR. ARE YOU SEE A IN OUR AND

01:56:40.960 --> 01:56:41.527
GIVEN THE FACT THAT IT'S ONLY

RECENTLY STARTED A LINE ITEM

01:56:43.296 --> 01:56:46.999

SPEND THE MOST TIME ON OUR FIRST

01:56:54.440 --> 01:56:55.341
RECOMMENDATION GIVEN THAT THE

01:56:55.408 --> 01:56:56.976
AGENDA ASKS US TO ELABORATE A

01:56:57.043 --> 01:56:58.277
LITTLE MORE ON IT AND THEN ALL

01:56:58.344 --> 01:57:00.279
OF. LEAVE THE OTHER TWO

01:57:00.346 --> 01:57:01.848
RECOMMENDATIONS JUST AT A HIGH

01:57:01.914 --> 01:57:03.616
LEVEL. THE AVAILABLE FOR Q. NA-

01:57:03.683 --> 01:57:05.785
EACH STORE FIRST RECOMMENDATION

01:57:05.852 --> 01:57:07.387
IS THAT THE LEGISLATURE

01:57:07.453 --> 01:57:09.455
INCORPORATE STATE FUNDING FOR

01:57:09.522 --> 01:57:10.823
THE AGRICULTURAL EXPERIMENT

01:57:10.890 --> 01:57:12.392
STATION PROGRAMMED INTO THE LINE

01:57:12.458 --> 01:57:14.761
ITEM. CURRENTLY THE LINE ITEM

01:57:14.827 --> 01:57:16.329
PROVIDES FUNDING FOR YOU SEE A

01:57:16.396 --> 01:57:19.132
IN OUR WHICH- REALLY ESSENTIAL

01:57:19.198 --> 01:57:20.400
EFFECTIVELY PROVIDES FUNDING FOR

01:57:20.466 --> 01:57:22.402
COOPERATIVE EXTENSION. YOU SEE

01:57:22.468 --> 01:57:25.004
STILL HAS FLEXIBILITY TO

01:57:25.071 --> 01:57:28.508
DETERMINE FUNDING FOR THE

01:57:28.574 --> 01:57:29.942
EXPERIMENT STATION PROGRAM. OUR

01:57:30.009 --> 01:57:31.177
REASONING WE HAVE TWO REASONS

01:57:31.244 --> 01:57:32.612
WHY WE THINK THIS APPROACH WOULD

01:57:32.678 --> 01:57:34.847
MAKE SENSE LOOKING FORWARD. THE

01:57:34.914 --> 01:57:37.283
FIRST IS IT WOULD IT- AND- MORE

01:57:37.350 --> 01:57:38.985
TRANSPARENCY AND CLARIFY HOW

01:57:39.051 --> 01:57:40.520
MUCH THE FUNDING IS GOING FOR

01:57:40.586 --> 01:57:41.788
THE EXPERIMENT STATIONS. AT THE%

01:57:41.854 --> 01:57:44.424
MOMENT THERE IS A LOT LESS

01:57:44.490 --> 01:57:46.125
INFORMATION AVAILABLE OF. THE

01:57:46.192 --> 01:57:47.660
LEGISLATURE ON THE EXPERIMENT

01:57:47.727 --> 01:57:50.363
STATIONS BUDGET RELATIVE TO THE-

01:57:50.430 --> 01:57:51.097
MUCH MORE CONSIDERABLE

01:57:51.164 --> 01:57:52.932
INFORMATION AVAILABLE ON YOU SEE

01:57:52.999 --> 01:57:54.801
AN ARTS BUDGET. WE THINK WE'RE

01:57:54.867 --> 01:57:56.269
GOING FORWARD THE LEGISLATURE

01:57:56.335 --> 01:57:57.703
WOULD HAVE- JUST BETTER CLARITY

01:57:57.770 --> 01:58:01.207
AS TO HOW MUCH FUNDING IS

01:58:01.274 --> 01:58:02.074
PROVIDING FOR THE PROGRAM. THE

01:58:02.141 --> 01:58:03.276
REASON IS WE THINK WOULD ALLOW A

01:58:03.342 --> 01:58:04.544
LITTLE BIT MORE CONSISTENCY IN

01:58:04.610 --> 01:58:06.612
HOW THE PROGRAMS ARE BUDGETED-

01:58:06.679 --> 01:58:08.147
CURRENTLY THE PROGRAMS HAVE BEEN

01:58:08.214 --> 01:58:09.348
TREATED A LITTLE. SOMEWHAT

01:58:09.415 --> 01:58:11.384
DIFFERENTLY IN TERMS OF THEIR OF

01:58:11.451 --> 01:58:13.820
A BUDGETS. UNTIL RECENTLY

01:58:13.886 --> 01:58:15.655
COOPERATIVE EXTENSION AND THE

01:58:15.721 --> 01:58:16.889
FACT OF WHERE YOU SEE A AND R'S

01:58:16.956 --> 01:58:18.925
STATE FUNDING HAD BEEN. SOMEWHAT

01:58:18.991 --> 01:58:20.660
FLAT AND ACT AND THE DURING THE

01:58:20.726 --> 01:58:22.929
PANDEMIC WAS ACTUALLY PRODUCED

01:58:22.995 --> 01:58:26.098
BY THE STATE- AS AS- THE CHAIR

01:58:26.165 --> 01:58:28.668
NOTED- THAT BLASTERS BUDGET-

01:58:28.734 --> 01:58:30.169
REPLACE OF THAT REDUCTION AND

01:58:30.236 --> 01:58:31.804
PROVIDED A- NONTRADITIONAL

01:58:31.871 --> 01:58:34.240
AUGMENTATION TO HIRE MORE STAFF

01:58:34.307 --> 01:58:36.108
. BUT COMPARISON THE EXPERIMENT

01:58:36.175 --> 01:58:39.011
STATION PROGRAM HAS RECEIVED A

01:58:39.078 --> 01:58:40.613
COST OF LIVING ADJUSTMENTS EACH

01:58:40.680 --> 01:58:41.881
YEAR IN THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS

01:58:41.948 --> 01:58:43.449
AND ACCORDING TO THE UNIVERSITY

01:58:43.516 --> 01:58:45.251
WAS LARGELY PRODUCTIVE FROM

01:58:45.318 --> 01:58:46.919
ADOPTIONS DURING THE PANDEMIC.

01:58:46.986 --> 01:58:48.387
THERE DOESN'T SEEM TO BE A CLEAR

01:58:48.454 --> 01:58:49.689
BOB POLICY RATIONALE FOR THIS

01:58:49.755 --> 01:58:50.857
DIFFERENCE IN TREATMENT IT'S

01:58:50.923 --> 01:58:53.059
BASICALLY REFLECTING CAN YOU SEE

01:58:53.125 --> 01:58:55.261
THE CURRENT BUDGET PRACTICES. WE

01:58:55.328 --> 01:58:57.430
THINK I KEEPING OF THE FUNDS

01:58:57.497 --> 01:58:58.431
TOGETHER WOULD ALLOW THE

01:58:58.498 --> 01:59:00.166
LEGISLATURE TO LOOK MORE

01:59:00.233 --> 01:59:01.534
HOLISTICALLY AT BOTH PROGRAMS

01:59:01.601 --> 01:59:03.402
AND CONSIDER FUNDING FOR BOTH

01:59:03.469 --> 01:59:04.837
PROGRAMS NEED MOVING FORWARD AND

01:59:04.904 --> 01:59:06.339
HOW WAS YOUR WAY THE TRADEOFFS

01:59:06.405 --> 01:59:10.376
OF THE FUNDING MORE RESEARCH.

01:59:10.443 --> 01:59:10.943
VERSUS APPLIED RESEARCH NOT

01:59:11.010 --> 01:59:12.512
REACH. I'M SURE THAT YOU

01:59:12.578 --> 01:59:14.113
RECOMMEND ARE REALLY AROUND JUST

01:59:14.180 --> 01:59:15.681
ADDING MORE ACCORDING THE AIM OF

01:59:15.748 --> 01:59:17.550
IMPROVING- THE LEGISLATURE'S

02:02:17.229 --> 02:02:19.765
FOLKS THAT WORK WITH US TWENTY

02:02:19.832 --> 02:02:21.701
THIRTY EVEN FORTY YEARS WHEN WE

02:02:21.767 --> 02:02:23.569
HAVE SOME FOLKS THAT LONG. IS

02:02:23.636 --> 02:02:26.872
THAT- IN A CHANGING SITUATION

02:02:26.939 --> 02:02:28.174
SUCH AS CALIFORNIA. SOMEBODY

02:02:28.240 --> 02:02:30.042
WHO'S BEEN WORKING ON A CROP IN

02:02:30.109 --> 02:02:31.944
ONE COUNTY FOR FORTY YEARS IT'S

02:02:32.011 --> 02:02:33.345
POSSIBLE THAT CROSSES AND EVEN

02:02:33.412 --> 02:02:35.347
GROWN IN THAT COUNTY ANYMORE. SO

02:02:35.414 --> 02:02:36.716
THAT'S WHY WE DO OUR POSITION

02:02:36.782 --> 02:02:38.284
CALL PROCESS AND MAKE SURE THAT

02:02:38.350 --> 02:02:40.486
WE'RE SERVING FOR TODAY'S AND

02:02:40.553 --> 02:02:42.421
TOMORROW'S NEEDS TO HAVE IT AND

02:02:42.488 --> 02:02:44.156
LET ME SAY I TOTALLY APPRECIATE

02:02:44.223 --> 02:02:45.758
THAT THAT MAKES TOTAL SENSE I

02:02:45.825 --> 02:02:48.427
SUPPORT THAT. I JUST KNOW THAT

02:02:48.494 --> 02:02:50.196
IN ONE OF THE COUNTIES IN MY

02:02:50.262 --> 02:02:51.363
DISTRICT. ARE ARE THEY HAVE A

02:02:51.430 --> 02:02:53.399
NUMBER OF EMPLOYEES AND ALL BUT

02:02:53.466 --> 02:02:54.900
TWO WERE RETIREMENT AGE AND SO

02:02:54.967 --> 02:02:57.336
THEY WERE FREAKING OUT DID THAT

02:02:57.403 --> 02:02:59.438
THOSE POSITIONS WON'T BE FILLED.

02:02:59.505 --> 02:03:01.207
AND IF IT TURNS OUT THAT A CROP

02:03:01.273 --> 02:03:02.475
ISN'T GROWN ANYMORE AND

02:03:02.541 --> 02:03:03.743
SOMEBODY'S ROTATED OUT FOR THAT

02:03:03.809 --> 02:03:05.745
TOTALLY UNDERSTANDABLE I THINK

02:03:05.811 --> 02:03:06.912
IT'S JUST MAKING SURE THAT

02:03:06.979 --> 02:03:08.781
THERE'S- THERE'S STILL ONE

02:03:08.848 --> 02:03:10.683
BEHIND IN THE MIDST OF THIS. AND

02:03:10.750 --> 02:03:13.018
THEN LET ME ASK A QUESTION A

02:03:13.085 --> 02:03:16.522
FINANCE. FIRM ONE OF THE REASONS

02:03:16.589 --> 02:03:18.858
THAT. THAT WE DID THIS

02:03:18.924 --> 02:03:21.427
RESTORATION LAST YEAR. WAS IT

02:03:21.494 --> 02:03:23.429
WAS AS DALY- JUST SAID THERE

02:03:23.496 --> 02:03:24.663
WERE A NUMBER OF YEARS IN WHICH

02:03:24.730 --> 02:03:26.265
FUNDING FOR THIS PROGRAM WAS

02:03:26.332 --> 02:03:29.602
FLAT. AND THEN LO AND BEHOLD. OF

02:03:29.668 --> 02:03:30.903
THIS YEAR FINANCE DID NOT

02:03:30.970 --> 02:03:34.006
PROPOSE A COLA A AND I CAN

02:03:34.073 --> 02:03:35.841
IMAGINE THAT IT'S AN EXPECTATION

02:03:35.908 --> 02:03:37.877
THAT THE MONEY WOULD BE FULLY

02:03:37.943 --> 02:03:40.446
SPENT BUT- IT SEEMS TO ME LIKE

02:03:40.513 --> 02:03:42.515
IT'S A REAL PRECEDENT OR COULD

02:03:42.581 --> 02:03:44.583
WE JUST NOT FALL BEHIND AGAIN

02:03:44.650 --> 02:03:48.154
AND- SO. NOW THAT I'VE STATED A

02:03:48.220 --> 02:03:49.889
VERY FIRM A PEN AND PUSHED YOU

02:03:49.955 --> 02:03:53.259
INTO THE CORNER WOULD YOU LIKE

TO MAKE A COMMENT. I WANT TO

02:03:54.727 --> 02:03:57.129
CHURCH A YOU. SO THE GOVERNOR'S

02:03:57.196 --> 02:03:59.999
BUDGET DOES NOT INCLUDE A COLA

02:04:00.065 --> 02:04:04.136
FOR YOU SEE IN OUR- THAT'S

02:04:04.203 --> 02:04:05.738
THAT'S WHERE WE STAND RIGHT NOW.

02:04:05.805 --> 02:04:07.573
OKAY MORE THAN I WILL SAY I

02:04:07.640 --> 02:04:09.074
STAND DIFFERENTLY SO I HOPE BY

02:04:09.141 --> 02:04:10.442
THE TIME WE GET TO THE MARKET

02:04:10.509 --> 02:04:12.444
MAY REVISE YOU CAN FIGURE OUT A

02:04:12.511 --> 02:04:14.914
CALL US SO WE JUST DON'T FALL

02:04:14.980 --> 02:04:16.816

IT TURNS OUT THEY'RE NOT GOING

02:04:18.184 --> 02:04:19.351
TO SPEND ALL OF THIS YEAR'S

02:04:19.418 --> 02:04:21.353
MONEY BECAUSE IT TAKES SO LONG

02:04:21.420 --> 02:04:23.422
TO RECRUIT AND GET COMPLETELY OP

02:04:23.489 --> 02:04:25.391

TWENTY TWENTY UC CAMPUSES WERE

02:25:18.609 --> 02:25:20.845
HOUSING ABOUT HUNDRED EIGHTY

02:25:20.912 --> 02:25:23.014
THOUSAND STUDENTS OR 87% OF THE

02:25:23.081 --> 02:25:25.016
STUDENT POPULATION. SOME OF OUR

02:25:25.083 --> 02:25:26.350
CAMPUSES WOULD LIKE THE HOUSE

ANNUALLY AND AS WE INCREASE

02:25:35.726 --> 02:25:37.528
GRADUATE STUDENT ENROLLMENT WE

02:25:37.595 --> 02:25:39.030
WILL NEED MORE HOUSING TO ENSURE

02:25:39.097 --> 02:25:40.631
WE CONTINUE TO MAKE SAFE AND

02:25:40.698 --> 02:25:43.434
AFFORDABLE HOUSING. AVAILABLE

THANK YOU AND LET ME JUST CUT TO

02:25:48.339 --> 02:25:51.876
THE CHASE WITH A QUESTION- THE

02:25:51.943 --> 02:25:54.779
OF. LEGISLATURE AND GOVERNOR

02:25:54.846 --> 02:25:58.449
LAST YEAR- DID TWO BILLION

02:25:58.516 --> 02:26:01.085
DOLLARS FOR HIGHER EDUCATION

02:26:01.152 --> 02:26:04.188

COMMUNITY COLLEGE HEARING NEXT

02:26:17.068 --> 02:26:19.804
WEEK A. N. IT IT SEEMS TO ME

02:26:19.871 --> 02:26:21.405
THAT IT'S JUST DRAMATICALLY

02:26:21.472 --> 02:26:23.474
OVERSUBSCRIBED FROM THE START

02:26:23.541 --> 02:26:27.612
SO. DID I UNDERSTAND THAT THE

02:26:27.678 --> 02:26:32.183
UNIVERSITY HAS- AN AGGREGATE OF

02:26:32.250 --> 02:26:33.384

HUNDRED MILLION WORTH OF

02:26:47.331 --> 02:26:49.467
PROJECTS AND DOES THAT MEAN THAT

EXPECTING THE STATE TO DO THAT

02:26:56.974 --> 02:26:58.709
AND HOW THE APPLICATIONS COME.

02:26:58.776 --> 02:27:00.678
WE ARE ANTICIPATING THE STATE

02:27:00.745 --> 02:27:02.847
THE SELECT WHICH PROGRAMS WHICH

02:27:02.914 --> 02:27:05.283
PROJECTS THEY WANT TO FIND- AND

02:27:05.349 --> 02:27:06.784
SHOULD THERE BE MORE FUNDING

02:27:06.851 --> 02:27:08.519

OPENS UP THE NEXT ROUND OF

02:27:28.005 --> 02:27:30.508

ADDITIONAL CAMPUSES TO APPLY FOR

THAT IS THAT BASICALLY TO

02:28:11.549 --> 02:28:14.418
DEMONSTRATE THE NEED EVEN IF

02:28:14.485 --> 02:28:15.419
IT'S NOT CLEAR THAT THERE'S

02:28:15.486 --> 02:28:17.255
MONEY AVAILABLE. WHERE WE WANT

02:28:17.321 --> 02:28:18.422
TO MAKE CERTAIN THAT OUR

02:28:18.489 --> 02:28:20.091

COMPETE WE DON'T WANT TO TELL

02:28:23.227 --> 02:28:24.662
THEM THEY CAN'T COMPETE BUT I

02:28:24.729 --> 02:28:27.832
MEAN ARE YOU IF THE FOUR HUNDRED

02:28:27.898 --> 02:28:28.966
MILLION WAS GIVEN TO THE

02:28:29.033 --> 02:28:31.369
UNIVERSITY. IN GRANTS IN THE

02:28:31.435 --> 02:28:34.005
FIRST YEAR- AND THEN PEOPLE ARE

STILL APPLYING YOU'RE SAYING YOU

02:28:36.073 --> 02:28:37.775
WANT THEM TO KNOW THEY CAN

02:28:37.842 --> 02:28:38.676
COMPETE BUT THE MONEY WOULD HAVE

02:28:38.743 --> 02:28:40.177
ALREADY BEEN SUBSCRIBE FOR THE

02:28:40.244 --> 02:28:42.747
FULL UC PORTION FOR THE THREE

02:28:42.813 --> 02:28:44.482
YEARS IS THAT CORRECT. THAT

02:28:44.548 --> 02:28:46.517
THAT'S CORRECT IT IS IT IS IT

02:28:46.584 --> 02:28:47.385
THAT JUST SEEMS LIKE A WEIRD

02:28:47.451 --> 02:28:50.288
PROCESS. IT A. N. I'M NOT I

02:28:50.354 --> 02:28:52.823
MEAN. IT'S YOUR ABILITY TO DO

02:28:52.890 --> 02:28:55.459
WHATEVER YOU WANT BURKE BUT IT

02:28:55.526 --> 02:28:56.694
SEEMS LIKE IT'S RAISING FALSE

02:28:56.761 --> 02:28:59.130
HOPES IN LESS WE DO. WHAT I

02:28:59.196 --> 02:29:00.765
WOULD HOPE WE WOULD DO IS FIGURE

02:29:00.831 --> 02:29:01.932
OUT HOW TO APPROPRIATE

02:29:01.999 --> 02:29:04.368
ADDITIONAL MONEY BECAUSE THEY

02:29:04.435 --> 02:29:05.736
NEED TO SPEND DEMONSTRATE. THIS

02:29:05.803 --> 02:29:10.007
IS SO- BUT I A N. DOT. N. I KNOW

02:29:10.074 --> 02:29:11.842
THAT WITHIN THE SIX HUNDRED

02:29:11.909 --> 02:29:14.845
MILLION. IT'S DIFFERENT CAMPUSES

02:29:14.912 --> 02:29:17.048
IT'S WHERE IT SHOVEL READY I

02:29:17.114 --> 02:29:18.749

THEIR MAJOR PROJECT AND THAT'S A

02:29:21.485 --> 02:29:22.887
VERY SIGNIFICANT PROJECT FOR

02:29:22.953 --> 02:29:30.194
THEM. AND SO- D. I. A. IN OUR-

02:29:30.261 --> 02:29:31.462
YOU'RE LOOKING TENSE I THINK I

02:29:31.529 --> 02:29:33.130
WOULD JUST MAKE THE STATEMENT

02:29:33.197 --> 02:29:36.334
THAT ARM. THAT I AGREE FOR ONE

02:29:36.400 --> 02:29:38.135
COMMITTEE MEMBER AND OTHERS CAN

02:29:38.202 --> 02:29:40.371
SPEAK FOR THEMSELVES THAT IT ALL

02:29:40.438 --> 02:29:42.340
THINGS BEING EQUAL BE NICE IF WE

02:29:42.406 --> 02:29:43.774
DID MORE FOR THIS OVER THE THREE

02:29:43.841 --> 02:29:45.609
YEARS TO ACCOMMODATE THE NEEDS

02:29:45.676 --> 02:29:47.445
THAT ACTUALLY EXISTS AND IT'S-

02:29:47.511 --> 02:29:49.180
IF YOU'VE GOT SOME CAMPUSES

02:29:49.246 --> 02:29:50.648
SAYING THEY DON'T WANT TO ADMIT

02:29:50.715 --> 02:29:51.549
STUDENTS IN LEICESTER'S HOUSING

02:29:51.615 --> 02:29:53.284
AND THEN. THERE'S NOT ENOUGH

02:29:53.351 --> 02:29:55.786
GRANTS FOR HOUSING AND IF YOU

02:29:55.853 --> 02:29:57.888

02:29:57.955 --> 02:29:59.390
CALIFORNIA HOUSING MARKET IS

02:29:59.457 --> 02:30:00.758
IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO GET

02:30:00.825 --> 02:30:04.495
HOUSING AND SOME. SOME CAMPUSES-

02:30:04.562 --> 02:30:07.765

PLACE TO LIVE AFTER ACCEPTANCE

02:30:13.738 --> 02:30:15.072

02:30:15.139 --> 02:30:17.007
OF THEIR EDUCATION THIS IS

02:30:17.074 --> 02:30:20.277
OBVIOUSLY A REAL ISSUE SO. I

02:30:20.344 --> 02:30:21.579
THINK WITHOUT GOING BACK AND

02:30:21.645 --> 02:30:23.948

MORE FOR THIS AND I DON'T KNOW

02:30:32.957 --> 02:30:34.825
IF THAT'S GOING TO WORK. BUT

02:30:34.892 --> 02:30:35.659

220% BELOW THE MARKET LEVEL.

02:31:21.272 --> 02:31:23.073
