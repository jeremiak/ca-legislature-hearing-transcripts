TODAY -- BUT

00:21:54.479 --> 00:21:54.980
PROBABLY NOT FOR SOME OF THE

00:21:55.047 --> 00:21:56.314
REASONS THAT MANY OF YOU MIGHT

00:21:56.381 --> 00:21:57.249
THINK YEAH --

00:21:57.315 --> 00:21:57.883
I DON'T KNOW IF I WOULD CALL

00:21:57.949 --> 00:22:00.585

00:22:00.652 --> 00:22:02.587
LIKE IS WHAT HAS BEEN WRITTEN

00:22:02.654 --> 00:22:05.057
ABOUT THE PURPOSE OF OUR OF OF

00:22:05.123 --> 00:22:06.291
OF TAXING.

00:22:06.358 --> 00:22:07.626
OF CITIZENS IS TO PROVIDE

00:22:07.693 --> 00:22:09.761
NECESSARY OF SERVICES --

00:22:09.828 --> 00:22:11.697
TO THE TO THE PUBLIC AND EVERY

00:22:11.763 --> 00:22:13.532
TIME YOU HAVE ONE CREDIT OR

00:22:13.598 --> 00:22:14.599
ANOTHER YOU ARE IN ESSENCE

00:22:14.666 --> 00:22:16.968
PICKING WINNERS AND LOSERS --

00:22:17.035 --> 00:22:18.036
AND IF WE DON'T HAVE SOME

00:22:18.103 --> 00:22:19.237
MECHANISM BUT PLACE IT SAYS

00:22:19.304 --> 00:22:20.972
THERE'S SOME REALLY REALLY

00:22:21.039 --> 00:22:24.810
REALLY GOOD REASON. FOR THAT

00:22:24.876 --> 00:22:27.012
THEN I'M NOT SURE THAT WE SHOULD

00:22:27.079 --> 00:22:28.346
IN THE COUNTRY I THINK THAT'S

00:22:28.413 --> 00:22:30.415
UNACCEPTABLE HE AT THE SAME TIME

00:22:30.482 --> 00:22:31.450
WE HAVE ALL THESE OTHER.

00:22:31.516 --> 00:22:33.552
CREDITS AND SO FORTH SO I THINK

00:22:33.618 --> 00:22:34.319
THIS MAKES A AN AWFUL LOT OF

00:22:34.386 --> 00:22:37.122
SENSE A PROBABLY FOR DIFFERENT

00:22:37.189 --> 00:22:37.389
REASONS --

00:22:37.456 --> 00:22:39.524
BUT I'LL BE SUPPORTING IT TODAY.

00:22:39.591 --> 00:22:41.493
THEY GIVE US MAYES WAS COURT --

00:22:41.560 --> 00:22:42.360
I TAKE THE POSITION THERE SHOULD

00:22:42.427 --> 00:22:46.264
BE NO TAX DEDUCTIONS.

00:22:46.331 --> 00:22:47.733
TAX DEDUCTIONS.

00:22:47.799 --> 00:22:50.435
FAVOR PEOPLE WHO HAVE.

00:22:50.502 --> 00:22:52.337
FAVOR THE RICH.

00:22:52.404 --> 00:22:54.072
IF YOU HAVE A MULTI MILLION

00:22:54.139 --> 00:22:56.274
DOLLAR HOME AND YOU'RE BEING

00:22:56.341 --> 00:22:57.876
TAXED AT 13%.

00:22:57.943 --> 00:22:59.678
YOU GET A LOT MORE MONEY BACK

00:22:59.745 --> 00:23:01.980
THAN SOMEBODY WHO A BARELY PAYS

00:23:02.047 --> 00:23:05.650
TAXES ALL THIS PAIN IT 23%.

00:23:05.717 --> 00:23:07.953
SO IN MY OPINION THE ULTIMATE

00:23:08.019 --> 00:23:09.588
REFORM WOULD BE TO GET RID OF

00:23:09.654 --> 00:23:11.056
ALL TAX DEDUCTIONS.

00:23:11.123 --> 00:23:12.591
NOW I'M SURE CHAD YOU'D WANT

00:23:12.657 --> 00:23:15.060
THAT TO BE REVENUE NEUTRAL WE

00:23:15.127 --> 00:23:16.294

TRYING TO DO HERE HOWEVER.

00:35:04.535 --> 00:35:05.970
LIKE ALL TAX DEDUCTIONS AND IN

00:35:06.037 --> 00:35:07.939
FACT THIS IS A DEDUCTION YOU'RE

00:35:08.005 --> 00:35:09.173
GETTING TO DEDUCT.

00:35:09.240 --> 00:35:12.009
FROM YOUR DO TAXES WHAT YOU WERE

00:35:12.076 --> 00:35:14.378
PAID BY THE DISTRICT.

00:35:14.445 --> 00:35:15.646
IN AFFECTED TO DEDUCTION WHICH

00:35:15.713 --> 00:35:17.114
AT ANY RATE SOMEBODY EARNING A

00:35:17.181 --> 00:35:18.749
MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR IS GOING

00:35:18.816 --> 00:35:20.985
TO GET 13% BENEFIT.

00:35:21.052 --> 00:35:23.387
SOMEBODY EARNING THIRTY EIGHT

00:35:23.454 --> 00:35:24.622
THOUSAND GETS 4% TALK ABOUT

00:35:24.689 --> 00:35:25.890
MARRIED COUPLES.

00:35:25.957 --> 00:35:28.292
I JUST WHAT I WOULD RATHER SEE

00:35:28.359 --> 00:35:31.162
YOU DO IF YOU WANT TO ENCOURAGE

00:35:31.229 --> 00:35:32.663
THIS SORT OF WORK.

00:35:32.730 --> 00:35:34.966
IS IT WOULD MAKE MORE SENSE

00:35:35.032 --> 00:35:37.335
FRANKLY FOR THE STATE. TO

00:35:37.401 --> 00:35:40.304
SUBSIDIZE THE DISTRICTS OF THAT

00:35:40.371 --> 00:35:42.106
THEY COULD GIVE SOMEWHAT HIGHER --

00:35:42.173 --> 00:35:44.008
REBATES BUT THEN YOU'D BE GIVING

00:35:44.075 --> 00:35:47.178
THE SAME REBATE. TO A PERSON WHO

00:35:47.245 --> 00:35:51.282
MADE YOU MADE A MILLION.

00:35:51.349 --> 00:35:53.084
THAT THAT'S MY CONCERN HERE

00:35:53.150 --> 00:35:54.218
YOU'RE YOU'RE BASICALLY GIVING

00:35:54.285 --> 00:35:57.021
THEM A BETTER BREAK TO THE

00:35:57.088 --> 00:36:01.025
PEOPLE WHO EARN MORE.

00:36:01.092 --> 00:36:01.826
I WENT OVER AND TURNED TO MISS

00:36:01.893 --> 00:36:04.996
FUTILITY TO RESPOND I

00:36:05.062 --> 00:36:06.864
RESPECTFULLY DISAGREE BUT I

00:36:06.931 --> 00:36:07.198
THINK THAT --

00:36:07.265 --> 00:36:09.867
WILL HAVE A MORE DETAILED

00:36:09.934 --> 00:36:11.869
RESPONSE IN MISTER --

00:36:11.936 --> 00:36:12.870
MISTER PARK ASSEMBLY MEMBER

00:36:12.937 --> 00:36:14.639
QUIRK I RESPECTFULLY DISAGREE AS

00:36:14.705 --> 00:36:15.606
WELL THESE ARE ACTUALLY

00:36:15.673 --> 00:36:17.575
EXEMPTIONS THESE ARE NOT CREDITS.

00:36:17.642 --> 00:36:19.410
SO THE WAY THE PROGRAM WORKS IS

00:36:19.477 --> 00:36:20.978
THAT A HOUSEHOLD WOULD ENROLL IN

00:36:21.045 --> 00:36:21.846
OUR TURF REPLACE.

00:36:21.913 --> 00:36:22.113
REBATE --

00:36:22.179 --> 00:36:23.881
REPLACEMENT PROGRAM AND THEN

00:36:23.948 --> 00:36:25.216
UPON SUBMITTING INFORMATION TO

00:36:25.283 --> 00:36:26.183
US THAN THEY WOULD RECEIVE A

00:36:26.250 --> 00:36:28.252
REBATE SO THEY ARE REIMBURSED

00:36:28.319 --> 00:36:29.987
ACTUALLY SO IT'S ESSENTIALLY

00:36:30.054 --> 00:36:31.322
IT'S LIKE A GRANT --

00:36:31.389 --> 00:36:32.823
THAT WE ARE PROVIDING TO THEM

00:36:32.890 --> 00:36:35.126
WHAT HAPPENS IS THEN THEY GET A

00:36:35.192 --> 00:36:36.394
TEN NINETY NINE A FEDERAL TEN

00:36:36.460 --> 00:36:36.961
NINETY NINE AND THEN THEY

00:36:37.028 --> 00:36:38.062
REALIZE THAT THAT AMOUNT THAT

00:36:38.129 --> 00:36:39.397
WE'VE GRANTED TO THEM AS THE

00:36:39.463 --> 00:36:40.231
REBATE.

00:36:40.298 --> 00:36:41.966
IS THEN SUBJECT TO INCOME TAX

00:36:42.033 --> 00:36:43.301
AND THAT'S WHERE THE ISSUE COMES

00:36:43.367 --> 00:36:44.635
UP SO WE'RE NOT TREATING THEM AS

00:36:44.702 --> 00:36:45.570
CREDITS.

00:36:45.636 --> 00:36:48.506
ON THIS IS ACTUALLY THIS IS --

00:36:48.573 --> 00:36:50.808
SO IT'S NOT INCOME PER SE WELL

00:36:50.875 --> 00:36:53.010
AT ANY RATE YOU ARE GIVING THE

00:36:53.077 --> 00:36:54.478
BIGGEST BREAK TO THE PEOPLE WHO

00:36:54.545 --> 00:36:57.248
MAKE THE MOST MONEY.

00:36:57.315 --> 00:36:59.417
THAT'S MY CONCERN.

00:36:59.483 --> 00:37:01.552
YOU'RE GIVING THEM 13% BACK THEY

00:37:01.619 --> 00:37:04.055
WOULD ORDINARILY PAY 13% ON SAY

00:37:04.121 --> 00:37:05.289
A HUNDRED DOLLARS THEY'D BE

00:37:05.356 --> 00:37:07.758
PAYING THIRTEEN DOLLARS IN TAX.

00:37:07.825 --> 00:37:10.161
WHERE SOMEBODY WHO MADE SIXTEEN

00:37:10.227 --> 00:37:11.395
THOUSAND WOULD BE PAYING TWO

00:37:11.462 --> 00:37:12.863
DOLLARS IN TAX SO YOU'RE GIVING

00:37:12.930 --> 00:37:14.665
THE BIGGEST BREAK TO THE PERSON

00:37:14.732 --> 00:37:16.100
WHO MAKES THE MOST MONEY?

00:37:16.167 --> 00:37:18.102
THAT'S MY CONCERN AND I WOULD

00:37:18.169 --> 00:37:20.071
RATHER SEE A PROGRAM THAT GIVES

00:37:20.137 --> 00:37:22.273
THE SAME BREAK TO EVERYBODY AND

00:37:22.340 --> 00:37:23.841
THERE ARE WAYS TO DESIGN THAT.

00:37:23.908 --> 00:37:25.309
BUT NOT THIS NOT SOMETHING

00:37:25.376 --> 00:37:28.546
THAT'S GOING MAKE MORE MONEY.

00:37:28.613 --> 00:37:30.881
THIS IS A CONCERN I HAVE WITH

00:37:30.948 --> 00:37:31.515

00:37:40.925 --> 00:37:42.126
I DON'T THINK YES.

00:37:42.193 --> 00:37:43.961
AND AND BECAUSE HE'S HAD A

00:37:44.028 --> 00:37:45.363

IN OPPOSITION TO THIS MEASURE --

00:59:10.113 --> 00:59:11.781
IT IS ANTICIPATED TO REDUCE THE

00:59:13.449 --> 00:59:14.651

THAT HAS SUCH A LARGE PRICE TAG

00:59:25.228 --> 00:59:26.763
CERTAINLY WE WOULD URGE THAT THE

LEGISLATURE WAYS THE BENEFITS --

00:59:28.631 --> 00:59:30.733

00:59:34.003 --> 00:59:34.837
EVIDENCE THAT THE MINIMUM

00:59:34.904 --> 00:59:36.973

00:59:37.040 --> 00:59:38.174
BUSINESS FORMATION.

THAT INDIVIDUAL DOESN'T EVEN

OPEN A BUSINESS AS A SOLE

RISKING INFECTION.

01:28:12.186 --> 01:28:13.521
AT A MINIMUM AND WORSE FROM

01:28:13.588 --> 01:28:15.723
THERE WE FOR FROM YOUNG GIRLS IN

01:28:15.790 --> 01:28:17.058
COLLEGE STUDENTS TO MISS SCHOOL

OF FOR THESE PRODUCTS.

01:28:22.597 --> 01:28:24.432
WE'VE HEARD FROM --

01:28:24.499 --> 01:28:25.667
HOW HOMELESS WOMAN REPEALING THE

01:28:25.733 --> 01:28:27.168
TAX WOULD MAKE THESE PRODUCTS A

01:28:27.235 --> 01:28:28.569
LITTLE MORE AFFORDABLE FOR THOSE

01:28:28.636 --> 01:28:31.139
GROUPS FOR LOW INCOME HOUSEHOLD?

01:28:31.205 --> 01:28:33.074
FOR COLLEGE STUDENTS FOR THE

01:28:33.141 --> 01:28:34.308
HOMELESS.

01:28:34.375 --> 01:28:35.209
BUT THIS ISN'T JUST ABOUT

01:28:35.276 --> 01:28:36.444
PUTTING A LITTLE BIT MORE MONEY

01:28:36.511 --> 01:28:37.845
IN OUR POCKETS OF THE MEN AND

01:28:37.912 --> 01:28:39.647
WOMEN.

01:28:39.714 --> 01:28:40.915
BUT IT'S ABOUT MAKING SURE THAT

01:28:40.982 --> 01:28:42.917
WE HAVE A TAX CODE THAT'S

01:28:42.984 --> 01:28:44.652
REFLECTIVE OF A VALLEY'S ATTACKS

01:28:44.719 --> 01:28:46.421
WITH THE DOESN'T SINGLE OUT HALF

01:28:46.487 --> 01:28:47.655
OF THE POPULATION.

01:28:47.722 --> 01:28:49.457
THE TAX SO THAT THE SOME BALANCE

01:28:49.524 --> 01:28:51.025
THE BUDGET ON OUR UTERUS ON A

01:28:51.092 --> 01:28:52.593
REGULAR BASIS.

01:28:52.660 --> 01:28:54.262
AND SO THE ANSWER TO DAY I HOPE

01:28:54.328 --> 01:28:57.465
FROM ALL OF US THE TAX WITH

01:28:57.532 --> 01:29:00.068
THAT'S FAIR AND GENDER NEUTRAL.

01:29:00.134 --> 01:29:01.102
WHEN WE STARTED --

01:29:01.169 --> 01:29:02.837
WILL BE VERY TAXING PRODUCTS IT

01:29:02.904 --> 01:29:04.305
WAS A TIME WHERE THE LEGISLATURE

01:29:04.372 --> 01:29:07.041
WAS COMPLETELY COMPRISED OF MEN.

01:29:07.108 --> 01:29:07.975
IT'S AN ISSUE THAT WE WEREN'T

01:29:08.042 --> 01:29:08.876
TALKING ABOUT THEN AND UNTIL

01:29:08.943 --> 01:29:10.378

01:29:10.445 --> 01:29:11.345
ANYWHERE.

01:29:11.412 --> 01:29:12.747
SO NOT SURPRISING THAT THIS IS

01:29:12.814 --> 01:29:15.717
FOR GOD AND AND OUR TAX CODE.

01:29:15.783 --> 01:29:17.218
AND SO I HOPE THAT TODAY OR NOT

01:29:17.285 --> 01:29:18.853
TO DAVE IN THE NEAR FUTURE WE

01:29:18.920 --> 01:29:20.488

REFORM ASSOCIATION IN OPPOSITION

01:40:11.238 --> 01:40:12.673
I THINK OF ALL OF THE BILLS THAT

01:40:12.740 --> 01:40:14.541
WE OPPOSE IN THIS COMMITTEE THIS

01:40:14.608 --> 01:40:15.976
ONE MIGHT MAKE ME THE MOST

01:40:16.043 --> 01:40:17.544
UNPOPULAR OF ALL OF THEM --

01:40:17.611 --> 01:40:19.446
BUT THAT SAID LET'S TALK IT

01:40:19.513 --> 01:40:20.681
THROUGH A LITTLE BIT.

01:40:20.748 --> 01:40:22.216
WINDS IN CALIFORNIA'S TAX CODE

01:40:22.282 --> 01:40:23.951
ARE ARE FREQUENTLY AND OFTEN

01:40:24.017 --> 01:40:25.986
ARBITRARILY DOT DRAWN EVEN IN

01:40:26.053 --> 01:40:27.988
INSTANCES OF SO CALLED NECESSITY

01:40:28.055 --> 01:40:28.555
AND I'LL GIVE YOU A COUPLE

01:40:28.622 --> 01:40:30.824
EXAMPLES. FOR EXAMPLE WE DON'T

01:40:30.891 --> 01:40:31.592
TAX FOOD IN THE STATE OF

01:40:31.658 --> 01:40:32.860
CALIFORNIA BUT THAT ALSO

01:40:32.926 --> 01:40:34.461
INCLUDES CANDY WHICH ARGUABLY

01:40:34.528 --> 01:40:36.864
NOT A NECESSITY WE DO HOWEVER

01:40:36.930 --> 01:40:39.166
TAX TOILET PAPERS.

01:40:39.233 --> 01:40:41.101
AS ANOTHER EXAMPLE WE DON'T TAX

01:40:41.168 --> 01:40:42.836
PRESCRIPTION MEDICATION IF THE

01:40:42.903 --> 01:40:44.271
DOCTOR HAS PRESCRIBED IT BUT THE

01:40:44.338 --> 01:40:45.939
SAME MEDICATION IF PURCHASED

01:40:46.006 --> 01:40:47.908
OVER THE COUNTER WE WOULD IN

01:40:47.975 --> 01:40:49.009
FACT TAX --

01:40:49.076 --> 01:40:50.477
SO THERE'S A LOT OF THINGS THAT

01:40:50.544 --> 01:40:52.646
DON'T MAKE A LOT OF SENSE IN

01:40:52.713 --> 01:40:54.148
CALIFORNIA'S TAX CODE.

01:40:54.214 --> 01:40:55.616
THIS WOULD BE THE FIRST MEASURE

01:40:55.682 --> 01:40:58.452
THAT WE AND THAT WAS ON THE

01:40:58.519 --> 01:41:00.687
BASIS OF GENDER SPECIFICALLY AND

01:41:00.754 --> 01:41:02.222
INTENTIONALLY BUT THEN IT ALSO

01:41:02.289 --> 01:41:04.391
BEGS A LOT OF OTHER QUESTIONS.

01:41:04.458 --> 01:41:05.959
ABOUT THE POSSIBILITIES FOR

01:41:06.026 --> 01:41:07.327
EXEMPTIONS THAT FOLLOW FOR

01:41:07.394 --> 01:41:09.530
EXAMPLE COSMETICS CLOTHING

01:41:09.596 --> 01:41:11.265
CLOTHING ARGUABLY BRAS ARE

01:41:11.331 --> 01:41:12.766
SOMETHING THAT WOMEN DO IN FACT

01:41:12.833 --> 01:41:14.668
NEED -- BUT

01:41:14.735 --> 01:41:16.236
THEY ARE TAXED.

01:41:16.303 --> 01:41:16.703
AND THEN --

01:41:16.770 --> 01:41:18.038
OTHER OVER THE COUNTER --

01:41:18.105 --> 01:41:19.873
PHARMACEUTICALS --

01:41:19.940 --> 01:41:21.275
THINGS LIKE CONTRACEPTIVES

01:41:21.341 --> 01:41:22.676
CONDOMS OVER THE COUNTER BIRTH

01:41:22.743 --> 01:41:24.945
CONTROL ARGUABLY SHOULD THESE BE

01:41:25.012 --> 01:41:26.480
TAXED -- IN

01:41:26.547 --> 01:41:28.715
ADDITION TO THAT.

01:41:28.782 --> 01:41:30.284
LET'S WALK THROUGH.

01:41:30.350 --> 01:41:32.986
THE SAVINGS I'M SO WAIT A FIFTY

01:41:33.053 --> 01:41:35.422
CAL BOX OF TAMPONS ASSUMING IT'S

01:41:35.489 --> 01:41:37.357
A REGULAR SIZE TAMPON TAMPAX

01:41:37.424 --> 01:41:38.759
PEARL TODAY WOULD COST NINE

01:41:38.826 --> 01:41:40.360
DOLLARS AND THIRTY NINE CENTS AT

01:41:40.427 --> 01:41:41.528
TARGET.

01:41:41.595 --> 01:41:44.198
AIMING A 6% STATE SALES TAX THIS

01:41:44.264 --> 01:41:45.699
MEASURE IF PASSED WOULD SAVE

01:41:45.766 --> 01:41:48.368
REGARDLESS OF NEED FIFTY SIX

01:41:48.435 --> 01:41:48.802
CENTS.

01:41:48.869 --> 01:41:51.438
PER BOX ASSUME ONE BOX PER MONTH

01:41:51.505 --> 01:41:53.040
IT WOULD SAVE UNDER SEVEN

01:41:53.106 --> 01:41:55.075
DOLLARS A YEAR FOR YOUR PROBABLY

01:41:55.142 --> 01:41:57.144
AVERAGE CONSUMER SO IN ESSENCE

01:41:57.211 --> 01:41:59.580
NOT ENOUGH TO BUY ANOTHER BOX OF

01:41:59.646 --> 01:42:00.948
TAMPONS --

01:42:01.014 --> 01:42:03.183
HOWEVER THE COST TO THE STATE OF

01:42:03.250 --> 01:42:04.852
IMPLEMENTING SUCH A MEASURE

01:42:04.918 --> 01:42:06.353
WOULD BE ABOUT APPROXIMATELY

01:42:06.420 --> 01:42:07.754
TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR

01:42:07.821 --> 01:42:09.456
EIGHT MILLION OF WHICH ANNUALLY

01:42:09.523 --> 01:42:11.391
WOULD BE A DIRECT HIT TO PUBLIC

01:42:11.458 --> 01:42:13.827
EDUCATION --

01:42:13.894 --> 01:42:14.995
THE ASSEMBLY WOMAN OBVIOUSLY IS

01:42:15.062 --> 01:42:16.463
WORKING ON THIS ISSUE FOR A LONG

01:42:16.530 --> 01:42:19.867
TIME HER A. B. TEN ON TWO

01:42:19.933 --> 01:42:20.501
THOUSAND SEVENTEEN I THINK IS A

01:42:20.567 --> 01:42:22.069
GREAT EXAMPLE OF HOW.

01:42:22.135 --> 01:42:23.437
YOU CAN.

01:42:23.504 --> 01:42:25.339
REDUCE THE BURDEN ON CERTAIN

01:42:25.405 --> 01:42:26.840
POPULATIONS OF WOMEN --

01:42:26.907 --> 01:42:28.141
THAT MEASURE --

01:42:28.208 --> 01:42:28.942
FOR THOSE WHO ARE UNFAMILIAR

01:42:29.009 --> 01:42:32.279
WITH IT ACTUALLY THAT PUBLIC

01:42:32.346 --> 01:42:34.047
SCHOOLS CERTAIN PUBLIC SCHOOLS

01:42:34.114 --> 01:42:34.548

STUDENTS IN NEED --

01:42:40.387 --> 01:42:41.388

WE DO APPRECIATE THE AUTHOR FOR

01:42:44.558 --> 01:42:46.627
BRINGING IT FORWARD BUT WOULD

01:42:46.693 --> 01:42:47.861
ENCOURAGE HER --

01:42:47.928 --> 01:42:50.230
TO CONTINUE TO CONSIDER OPTIONS

01:42:50.297 --> 01:42:51.932
SIMILAR TO AB TEN WHERE THOSE

01:42:51.999 --> 01:42:53.133
MOST IN NEED --

01:42:53.200 --> 01:42:54.735
CAN NOT ONLY GET A BENEFIT BUT A

01:42:54.801 --> 01:42:56.103
BENEFIT THAT WOULD REALLY BE

01:42:56.169 --> 01:42:57.504
MEANINGFUL --

01:42:57.571 --> 01:42:59.072
RATHER THAN ONE THAT WOULD SAVE

01:42:59.139 --> 01:43:00.340
WOMEN ACROSS THE STATE THE

01:43:00.407 --> 01:43:02.242

01:43:52.726 --> 01:43:53.961
DECIDING IF EIGHTY SENSITIVE

01:43:54.027 --> 01:43:55.662
ENOUGH OR NOT I HAVE FOLKS OUT

01:43:55.729 --> 01:43:57.197
THERE WAS JUST.

01:43:57.264 --> 01:43:58.365
ACTUALLY HAVING A DISCUSSION

01:43:58.432 --> 01:43:59.466
WITH.

01:43:59.533 --> 01:44:00.534
SOMEBODY ABOUT HOW WHEN I WAS

01:44:00.601 --> 01:44:03.704
SICK MY SISTER NICE TO PULL OUR

01:44:03.770 --> 01:44:06.006
MONEY TOGETHER TO BUY WHEN THOSE

01:44:06.073 --> 01:44:07.174
LITTLE TINY BAGS OF CHIPS AND

01:44:07.240 --> 01:44:09.142
WITH A QUARTER --

01:44:09.209 --> 01:44:10.077
AND SO.

01:44:10.143 --> 01:44:11.345
PICK UP PENNIES WHATEVER I WAS

01:44:11.411 --> 01:44:12.412
LIKE WE'RE GONNA HAVE THIS KNACK

01:44:12.479 --> 01:44:14.014
INSTILLED THAT TWENTY FIVE CENTS

01:44:14.081 --> 01:44:15.182
AND LIKE THE WORLD TO AS IT ALSO

01:44:15.248 --> 01:44:16.083
MEANT THAT MAYBE I GOT TWO OF

01:44:16.149 --> 01:44:17.217
THE PULL THAT DAY YOU KNOW AND

01:44:17.284 --> 01:44:17.718
SO.

01:44:17.784 --> 01:44:18.452
I THINK IT'S UP TO THE

01:44:18.518 --> 01:44:20.320
INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE ON A LIMITED

01:44:20.387 --> 01:44:21.355
BUDGET FOR THEM THAT EIGHTY

01:44:21.421 --> 01:44:22.723
SINCE MY MEAN A LOT AND EIGHTY

01:44:22.789 --> 01:44:23.256
CENTS.

01:44:23.323 --> 01:44:25.492
A DOLLAR I MEAN IT VARIES BY

01:44:25.559 --> 01:44:27.060
EIGHT BY HELPFUL INDIVIDUALS.

01:44:27.127 --> 01:44:28.028
I DON'T THINK WE SHOULD BE

01:44:28.095 --> 01:44:29.730
DRAWING THE LINE OF WHAT CAN

01:44:29.796 --> 01:44:30.697
HAPPEN IF I WOULD USE THAT SAME

01:44:30.764 --> 01:44:32.766
LOT LOGIC TO SAY THAN THE TWENTY

01:44:32.833 --> 01:44:33.834
MILLION DOLLARS THAT WE USE IS

01:44:33.900 --> 01:44:35.202
THE PORTABLE.

01:44:35.268 --> 01:44:37.971
BUT THIS IS ABOUT ON THE LINE I

01:44:38.038 --> 01:44:38.805
WANNA I WANNA TALK THAT THE

01:44:38.872 --> 01:44:40.440
OPPOSITION THEY TALKED ABOUT.

01:44:40.507 --> 01:44:42.275
DRAWING THE LINE IN IN A GENDER

01:44:42.342 --> 01:44:44.511
SPECIFIC THIS IS THE ONLY GENDER

01:44:44.578 --> 01:44:46.813
SPECIFIC ITEM IN OUR TAX CODE.

01:44:46.880 --> 01:44:48.382
THIS IS THE ONLY THING THAT SAYS

01:44:48.448 --> 01:44:50.117
THAT MY UTERUS ON BORN WITH THE

01:44:50.183 --> 01:44:51.385

IS A LUXURY THERE'S NOTHING ELSE

01:44:55.255 --> 01:44:56.390
AND I THOUGHT SELECT THAT AND WE

01:44:56.456 --> 01:44:58.725
TALKED ABOUT COSMETICS AND

01:44:58.792 --> 01:45:00.627
CLOTHING NOT ESSENTIALS.

01:45:00.694 --> 01:45:02.696
PLACENTALS IKE ADVOCATE DISS HAS

01:45:02.763 --> 01:45:04.998
BEEN DOING THE MEDICAL NECESSITY

01:45:05.065 --> 01:45:06.199
AND NOW HE SOUTH LOOKS LET'S

01:45:06.266 --> 01:45:08.301
TAKE A MONTH FOR THE NEXT MONTH

01:45:08.368 --> 01:45:09.369
EVERYONE THE MINISTRY SO THAT

01:45:09.436 --> 01:45:10.137
WHICH OPERATING GO AHEAD AND

01:45:10.203 --> 01:45:10.704
HAVE THAT BLOOD.

01:45:10.771 --> 01:45:13.340
STAIN EVERYWHERE ON AND YOU KNOW

01:45:13.407 --> 01:45:14.908
LET'S ALSO NOT SHAVER LIFT UP

01:45:14.975 --> 01:45:16.243
AND MAKE UP THE EFFECTS ARE NOT

01:45:16.309 --> 01:45:17.911
THE SAME THE REALITY IS NOT THE

01:45:17.978 --> 01:45:19.746
SAME OUT THERE WE SHOULD HAVE A

01:45:19.813 --> 01:45:21.248
GENERAL INTEREST TAX CODE AND

01:45:21.314 --> 01:45:22.783
IT'S ALSO ABOUT SAVINGS FOR

01:45:22.849 --> 01:45:24.151
THOSE FOLKS AND THEY COULD DIEM

01:45:24.217 --> 01:45:24.484
HOW TO BEST.

01:45:24.551 --> 01:45:32.059
USE WHETHER IT'S A QUARTER OR

01:45:32.125 --> 01:45:36.263
TWO DOLLARS YEP LOOKS AT THE

01:45:36.329 --> 01:45:37.497
TIME BUT THEY'RE BUYING

01:45:37.564 --> 01:45:39.066
INDIVIDUAL TAMPONS OUR PRODUCT

01:45:39.132 --> 01:45:39.900
OF THE TIMES THAT'S ALL THEY

01:45:39.966 --> 01:45:41.902
COULD AFFORD THAT AND THEY HAVE

01:45:41.968 --> 01:45:43.370
TO STRETCH OUT I TO MAKE IT WORK.

01:45:43.437 --> 01:45:44.938
AND CITING COMING FROM A

01:45:45.005 --> 01:45:45.605
POSITION OF PRIVILEGE AND SAYING

01:45:45.672 --> 01:45:46.273
EIGHTY CENTS IS NOT A LOT IS NOT

01:45:46.339 --> 01:45:49.109
A GOOD ENOUGH EXCUSE FOR ME NOT

01:45:49.176 --> 01:45:50.444
TO GET RID OF THIS TAX.

01:45:50.510 --> 01:45:51.445
NOT YET IN A DEBATE ON THE

01:45:51.511 --> 01:45:52.979
CONVERSATION BUT I MEAN.

01:45:53.046 --> 01:45:54.648
WE DO WORK IN PA I WILL WORK AND

01:45:54.715 --> 01:45:56.450
POVERTY REGULARLY AND IT'S NOT A

01:45:56.516 --> 01:45:58.218
COMMENTED AS TOO LATE WHETHER

01:45:58.285 --> 01:46:00.287
SIXTY OR FORTY OR FIFTY CENTS OR

01:46:00.353 --> 01:46:01.722
EIGHTY CENTS IS ENOUGH.

01:46:01.788 --> 01:46:04.658
THE QUESTION IS IS THAT.

01:46:04.725 --> 01:46:07.594
IS THAT FOR A YOU OR ME OR OR AB

01:46:07.661 --> 01:46:09.730
MIDDLE CLASS INDIVIDUAL ENOUGH

01:46:09.796 --> 01:46:10.931
TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE.

01:46:10.997 --> 01:46:12.866
AND ARE WE BEING TARGETED ABOUT

01:46:12.933 --> 01:46:14.267
THIS CONVERSATION.

01:46:14.334 --> 01:46:16.036
I AND THAT'S WHY MY QUESTION IS

01:46:16.103 --> 01:46:17.504
VERY GENUINELY.

01:46:17.571 --> 01:46:19.906
IS IS THIS ABOUT THE FACT THAT

01:46:19.973 --> 01:46:21.241
THIS IS THE ONLY PRODUCT.

01:46:21.308 --> 01:46:23.443
THAT IS TAX THAT IS A WOMAN ONLY

01:46:23.510 --> 01:46:28.215
PRODUCT OR IS THIS ABOUT THE

01:46:28.281 --> 01:46:29.282
TWENTY FOUR IN TO EIGHTY CENTS --

01:46:29.349 --> 01:46:30.584
BECAUSE FOR A LARGE PORTION OF

01:46:30.650 --> 01:46:32.586
THE POPULATION AND YOU KNOW I I

01:46:32.652 --> 01:46:34.421
IT IS THAT THAT SIXTY CENTS

01:46:34.488 --> 01:46:35.489
DOESN'T MEAN ANYTHING THAT

01:46:35.555 --> 01:46:36.189
EIGHTY CENTS DOESN'T MEAN

01:46:36.256 --> 01:46:36.890
ANYTHING.

01:46:36.957 --> 01:46:38.225
I UNDERSTAND THAT THERE ARE

01:46:38.291 --> 01:46:40.360
THOSE WHO BY INDIVIDUAL TAMPONS

01:46:40.427 --> 01:46:42.062
ARE BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT THEY CAN

01:46:42.129 --> 01:46:43.463
AFFORD AT THAT MOMENT.

01:46:43.530 --> 01:46:44.965
HOWEVER I THINK THAT THE

01:46:45.031 --> 01:46:48.301
CONVERSATION DIFFICULTY WITH

01:46:48.368 --> 01:46:49.870
THIS PARTICULAR BILL IS THAT IT

01:46:49.936 --> 01:46:51.638
DOESN'T IT ISN'T JUST FOR THOSE

01:46:51.705 --> 01:46:53.006
INDIVIDUALS IT'S FOR EVERYBODY.

01:46:53.073 --> 01:46:55.475
AND IS NOT JUST A CHAIR BUT AS A

01:46:55.542 --> 01:46:57.778
WOMAN CHAIR I CAN UNDERSTAND.

01:46:57.844 --> 01:46:59.713
THAT THIS THAT THERE IS AN ISSUE

01:46:59.780 --> 01:47:01.448
WITH THE FACT THAT THIS IS A

01:47:01.515 --> 01:47:03.049
PRODUCT THAT ONLY WOMEN USE AND

01:47:03.116 --> 01:47:04.651
THAT IT IS NOT SHOCKING TO ME ON

01:47:04.718 --> 01:47:05.752
ANY LEVEL.

01:47:05.819 --> 01:47:07.087
THAT THIS WOULD BE THE ONE

01:47:07.154 --> 01:47:09.523
PRODUCT THAT WOULD BE TAXED AND

01:47:09.589 --> 01:47:10.624
WE'RE OTHERS WOULDN'T BUT I

01:47:10.690 --> 01:47:11.658
WANTED TO KNOW WHAT YOUR

01:47:11.725 --> 01:47:13.093
INTENTION WAS AND I WANT TO MAKE

01:47:13.160 --> 01:47:14.394
SURE I UNDERSTAND IT.

01:47:14.461 --> 01:47:17.264
CLEARLY BOTH I HAVE A HASHTAG

01:47:17.330 --> 01:47:18.932
GENDER EQUITY AS IT IS ABOUT

01:47:18.999 --> 01:47:20.667
GENDER EQUITY AND THE TAX CODE --

01:47:20.734 --> 01:47:22.202
AND SO I WOULD LIKE A TAX CODE

01:47:22.269 --> 01:47:23.837
THAT.

01:47:23.904 --> 01:47:25.705
REFLECTS THE VALUES THAT.

01:47:25.772 --> 01:47:26.907
NO MATTER IF I'M LOW INCOME

01:47:26.973 --> 01:47:28.141
MIDDLE INCOME OR HIGH INCOME MY

01:47:28.208 --> 01:47:29.810
UTERUS IS NOT A LUXURY.

01:47:29.876 --> 01:47:31.211
ADMINISTRATION IS NOT A LUXURY

01:47:31.278 --> 01:47:32.846
THERE'S NOT A HAPPY HOUR I WOULD

01:47:32.913 --> 01:47:34.848
LOVE TO TAX CANDY AND SNACKS

01:47:34.915 --> 01:47:36.249
I'VE TRIED IT MULTIPLE TIMES

01:47:36.316 --> 01:47:37.484
THAT WOULD LOVE TO TAX.

01:47:37.551 --> 01:47:39.119
COCKTAILS --

01:47:39.186 --> 01:47:40.921
BUT IN THE MEANTIME WHILE WE GET

01:47:40.987 --> 01:47:42.355
THE POLITICAL WILL OF HOW WE

01:47:42.422 --> 01:47:47.627
REFORM ARE GROW THE TAX BASE.

01:47:47.694 --> 01:47:48.995
I WOULD LIKE.

01:47:49.062 --> 01:47:50.096
FIRST AND FOREMOST IMMEDIATELY

01:47:50.163 --> 01:47:51.364
PRESS TO HAVE A GENERAL NEUTRAL

01:47:51.431 --> 01:47:53.366
TAX CODE IT'S ABOUT THE MESSAGES

01:47:53.433 --> 01:47:54.534
VERY SENDING ABOUT WOMEN'S

01:47:54.601 --> 01:47:55.802
HEALTH AND WOMEN'S BIOLOGY ASAL

01:47:55.869 --> 01:47:57.737
HOLE A RESPECTIVE OF OUR INCOME.

01:47:57.804 --> 01:47:59.606
THANK IN PEACE IS ALSO IMPORTANT

01:47:59.673 --> 01:48:01.441
TO ME AND SO FROM IS ABOUT TO

01:48:01.508 --> 01:48:02.242
SEE ONE OR THE OTHER AND I

01:48:02.309 --> 01:48:05.245
HAVEN'T BEEN SHY ABOUT TALKING

01:48:05.312 --> 01:48:06.479
ABOUT GENDER EQUITY.

01:48:06.546 --> 01:48:08.548
AROUND THIS ISSUE AND THE AND

01:48:08.615 --> 01:48:09.883
COMMISSION ALSO COMES INTO PLAY

01:48:09.950 --> 01:48:11.084
BUT IF YOU WANT ME TO BREAK IT

01:48:11.151 --> 01:48:12.986
DOWN TO ONE I THINK EITHER

01:48:13.053 --> 01:48:15.255
MERITS A YES VOTE WHEN THIS IS

01:48:15.322 --> 01:48:16.656
UP FOR A VOTE --

01:48:16.723 --> 01:48:18.158

DR COURT DID YOU HAVE A QUESTION

01:48:24.731 --> 01:48:26.766

01:48:26.833 --> 01:48:28.668
SUPPOSE WE WERE TO JUST TAX MORE

01:48:28.735 --> 01:48:30.904
MALE PRODUCTS IN THAT WOULD EVEN

01:48:30.971 --> 01:48:34.941

01:48:44.517 --> 01:48:45.819
THAT THAT INNOVATIVE.

01:48:45.886 --> 01:48:47.754
IN ALL FAIRNESS I DON'T THINK

01:48:47.821 --> 01:48:50.190
IT'S FAIR TO ME TO SAY SUDDENLY

01:48:50.257 --> 01:48:51.591
IN THE SAME WAY THAT I'M ASKING

01:48:51.658 --> 01:48:52.926

SITUATIONS I MEAN WE SEE THIS --

01:56:53.539 --> 01:56:55.808
ON THE HEALTH COMMISSION THAT A

01:56:55.875 --> 01:56:58.745
NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO --

01:56:58.811 --> 01:57:01.414
YOU JUST CAN'T GET TO THE THEN

01:57:01.481 --> 01:57:03.716
BECOMES A LARGER SITUATION THE

01:57:03.783 --> 01:57:05.618
COSTS MORE MONEY FOR THE STATE

01:57:05.685 --> 01:57:07.387
MORE MONEY FOR OUR LOCAL

01:57:07.453 --> 01:57:09.222
GOVERNMENT BECAUSE NOW YOU GET

01:57:09.288 --> 01:57:10.823
INTO A SITUATION WHERE THERE ARE

01:57:10.890 --> 01:57:12.859
EMERGENCY --

01:57:12.925 --> 01:57:15.194
ISSUES THAT COME UP SO --

01:57:15.261 --> 01:57:17.797
IT DEFINITELY CAN I MEAN. THREE

01:57:17.864 --> 01:57:18.431
HUNDRED NINETY SEVEN DOLLARS OR

01:57:18.498 --> 01:57:21.334
EVEN FORTY SEVEN DOLLARS EVEN A

01:57:21.401 --> 01:57:22.135
HUNDRED DOLLARS FOR SOME OF MY

01:57:22.201 --> 01:57:23.503
CLIENTS --

01:57:23.569 --> 01:57:25.071
CAN MEAN A LOT IT CAN MEAN A LOT

01:57:25.138 --> 01:57:27.173
IN TERMS OF GROCERIES I HAVE A

01:57:27.240 --> 01:57:29.008
NUMBER OF CLIENTS WHO.

01:57:29.075 --> 01:57:31.711
ARE ON CAL FRESH AND AFTER TWO

01:57:31.778 --> 01:57:33.613
WEEKS THEY RUN OUT IN THE HAVE

01:57:33.679 --> 01:57:35.148
TO GET TO FOOD BANKS.

01:57:35.214 --> 01:57:37.150
AND NOT ALL RQUIRES MONEY AND

01:57:37.216 --> 01:57:38.618
IT SEEMS LIKE SUCH A LITTLE

01:57:38.684 --> 01:57:40.953
AMOUNT FOR A LOT OF FOLKS ARE IN

01:57:41.020 --> 01:57:42.355
THE MIDDLE CLASS OR UPPER MIDDLE

01:57:42.422 --> 01:57:43.489
CLASS.

01:57:43.556 --> 01:57:45.525
BUT THIS REALLY IS IT'S JUST

01:57:45.591 --> 01:57:47.960
CRITICAL I MEAN I I MEAN WE'RE

01:57:48.027 --> 01:57:49.362

FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE AT THIRTY

01:57:56.469 --> 01:57:58.171
THOUSAND DOLLARS AND BELOW IN

01:57:58.237 --> 01:57:58.638
TERMS OF THEIR INCOME

01:57:59.005 --> 01:58:00.440
THANK YOU.

01:58:00.506 --> 01:58:03.409
ANY ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS.

01:58:03.476 --> 01:58:05.178
YES ASSEMBLY MEMBER JIM NORTON

01:58:05.244 --> 01:58:06.279
WORTH THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR.

01:58:06.345 --> 01:58:09.782
I'M SU WE ARE CONTEMPLATING.

01:58:09.849 --> 01:58:11.217
AS A BODY AND AS CAL FOR

01:58:11.284 --> 01:58:12.885
GOVERNMENT AND NUMBER AS

01:58:12.952 --> 01:58:14.387
PROGRAMS THAT ARE YOU WOULD

01:58:14.454 --> 01:58:16.422
ADDRESS THE SAME POPULATION IN

01:58:16.489 --> 01:58:17.390
INCLUDING.

01:58:17.457 --> 01:58:19.459
CONVERSATION ON THE EXPANSION OF

01:58:19.525 --> 01:58:21.194
THE EARNED INCOME TAX CREDIT.

01:58:21.260 --> 01:58:22.929
IS THERE A REASON FOR WHY IT

01:58:22.995 --> 01:58:26.165
ADVOCATE IN SORT OF THIS

01:58:26.232 --> 01:58:27.333
STRATEGY.

01:58:27.400 --> 01:58:27.934
RATHER THAN SOMETHING THAT'S

01:58:28.000 --> 01:58:33.306
TAKES MORE BROAD BASED APPROACH.

01:58:33.372 --> 01:58:34.874
I CAN START AND THEN IF YOU IF

01:58:34.941 --> 01:58:36.375
YOU HAVE --

01:58:36.442 --> 01:58:37.743
FIRST OF ALL I THINK THEM MORE

01:58:37.810 --> 01:58:39.745
NUMBER OF TOOLS WE HAVE

01:58:39.812 --> 01:58:41.514
AVAILABLE TO US --

01:58:41.581 --> 01:58:45.518
GIVES US THE OPPORTUNITY --

01:58:45.585 --> 01:58:47.820
TO GO A CERTAIN PATH IF ANOTHER

01:58:47.887 --> 01:58:51.057
PATH THAT WE WERE PLACING A LOT

01:58:51.123 --> 01:58:52.825
OF OUR HOPES ON DIDN'T WORK.

01:58:52.892 --> 01:58:55.027
SO I THINK THIS ALLOWS US TO

01:58:55.094 --> 01:58:57.263
HAVE AN EXPANDED REPERTOIRE OF

01:58:57.330 --> 01:58:58.998
UP OF PATHWAYS.

01:58:59.065 --> 01:59:03.369
THAT'S ONE OF TO I I'M I'M

01:59:03.436 --> 01:59:05.505
ALWAYS WONDERING THE QUESTION OF

01:59:05.571 --> 01:59:06.806
ALSO IF THIS IS GOING TO COST

01:59:06.873 --> 01:59:08.808
THE STATE LET'S SEE UPWARDS OF

01:59:08.875 --> 01:59:10.543
HALF A BILLION --

01:59:10.610 --> 01:59:12.745
BUT THEN INDIVIDUALLY SOMEWHERE

01:59:12.812 --> 01:59:15.348
ROUGHLY AROUND THERE --

01:59:15.414 --> 01:59:21.120
I'M SORRY. ONE ONE BILLION.

01:59:21.187 --> 01:59:25.625
THIS IS THE WHAT ABOUT --

01:59:25.691 --> 01:59:26.926
IF WE ARE THE SAME WAY ABOUT IT

01:59:26.993 --> 01:59:27.527
IF IT WAS PLANTED A. B. AND

01:59:27.593 --> 01:59:28.895
BILLION REGARDLESS OF THE AMOUNT

01:59:28.961 --> 01:59:30.229
BECAUSE RIGHT NOW I THINK THE

01:59:30.296 --> 01:59:32.632
THE THE TARGET AUDIENCE IS THE

01:59:32.698 --> 01:59:33.499
MAXIMUM.

01:59:33.566 --> 01:59:35.701
POSSIBLE WHICH THEN ALLOWS FOR

01:59:35.768 --> 01:59:37.904
THERE TO BE A CONVERSATION OF

01:59:37.970 --> 01:59:39.672
WHERE DO WE WANTED TO GO WHO WE

01:59:39.739 --> 01:59:41.173
WANTED TO IMPACT.

01:59:41.240 --> 01:59:43.643
THAT'LL HAVE THE MOST

01:59:43.709 --> 01:59:44.844
SIGNIFICANT.

01:59:44.911 --> 01:59:46.546
OPPORTUNITY OF THIS OFFERING

01:59:46.612 --> 01:59:47.613
ASSISTANCE OR HELP.

01:59:47.680 --> 01:59:48.981
LET'S NOT FORGET ALSO THIS

01:59:49.048 --> 01:59:50.216
PROGRAM ENDED UP GETTING THE

01:59:50.283 --> 01:59:52.151
FUNDED AT THE MOST CRITICAL TIME

01:59:52.218 --> 01:59:53.986
AS WELL.

01:59:54.053 --> 01:59:54.587
IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHT WHEN WE

01:59:54.654 --> 01:59:56.222
WERE.

01:59:56.289 --> 01:59:58.624
A HIT WITH A CONFLUENCE OF

01:59:58.691 --> 02:00:01.093
DIFFERENT ECONOMIC IMPACTS

02:00:01.160 --> 02:00:02.295
INCLUDING THE HOUSING BUBBLE.

02:00:02.361 --> 02:00:03.663
WHEN PEOPLE WERE LOSING THEIR

02:00:03.729 --> 02:00:06.499
HOUSES --

02:00:06.566 --> 02:00:08.000
THERE WASN'T SOME TYPE OF A

02:00:08.067 --> 02:00:10.236
SMALL VERY SMALL RELIEF THAT

02:00:10.303 --> 02:00:13.272
THIS OFFERS. FOR THEM TO BE ABLE

02:00:13.339 --> 02:00:14.440
TO BE ABLE TO FIGURE OUT A WAY

02:00:14.507 --> 02:00:15.308
OF YOU KNOW.

02:00:15.374 --> 02:00:17.043
APPLYING AND GETTING SOME

02:00:17.109 --> 02:00:18.210
ADDITIONAL SUPPORT.

02:00:18.277 --> 02:00:20.179
AGAIN SMALL AMOUNT AND THE

02:00:20.246 --> 02:00:21.714
QUESTION GOES.

02:00:21.781 --> 02:00:22.682
TO YOU KNOW HOW MUCH ARE WE

02:00:22.748 --> 02:00:24.784
INVESTING AND PER UNIT

02:00:24.850 --> 02:00:26.819
CALIFORNIAN PER CAPITA WHAT IS

02:00:26.886 --> 02:00:29.622
IT GOING TO MEAN FOR THEM --

02:00:29.689 --> 02:00:31.757
THOSE ARE THINGS THAT I THINK WE

02:00:31.824 --> 02:00:33.726
CAN DISCUSS.

02:00:33.793 --> 02:00:35.695
OF MORE AS THIS BILL CONTINUES

02:00:35.761 --> 02:00:37.763
AND WE WE HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY

02:00:37.830 --> 02:00:38.030
TO MAYBE.

02:00:38.097 --> 02:00:42.602
LOOK AT WHAT VERSION OF IT.

02:00:42.668 --> 02:00:43.569
COMES OUT.

02:00:43.636 --> 02:00:45.037
SO THAT'S THAT'S WHAT I WANT TO

02:00:45.104 --> 02:00:46.772
LEAVE WITH.

02:00:46.839 --> 02:00:48.140
SO I DON'T SEE IT AS AN EITHER

02:00:48.207 --> 02:00:50.543
OR I THINK THAT WE NEED TO DO

02:00:50.610 --> 02:00:52.211
EVERYTHING WE CAN TO PROVIDE

02:00:52.278 --> 02:00:53.813
HELP AND ASSISTANCE FOR PEOPLE

02:00:53.879 --> 02:00:55.581
WHO ARE LOW INCOME --

02:00:55.648 --> 02:00:58.684
I WAS ONE OF THE DRAFTERS FOR S.

02:00:58.751 --> 02:00:59.552
EIGHTY WHICH IS OUR HOUSING

02:00:59.619 --> 02:01:00.519
FIRST BILL.

02:01:00.586 --> 02:01:02.688
AND THE REASON BASICALLY THAT

02:01:02.755 --> 02:01:03.889
THE GOVERNOR GAVE US THAT HE

02:01:03.956 --> 02:01:05.691
SIGNED THAT BILL WITH BECAUSE IT

02:01:05.758 --> 02:01:07.593
WAS A FISCAL BILL --

02:01:07.660 --> 02:01:08.828
WHICH BASICALLY MEANS THAT ONCE

02:01:08.894 --> 02:01:11.797
PEOPLE BECOME HOMELESS IT COST

02:01:11.864 --> 02:01:12.331
TWENTY FIVE TO THIRTY FIVE

02:01:12.398 --> 02:01:13.466
THOUSAND DOLLARS ANNUALLY FOR US

02:01:13.532 --> 02:01:14.934
TO SERVICE THAT POPULATION.

02:01:15.001 --> 02:01:16.469
THAT MEANS TO THE EXTENT THAT WE

02:01:16.535 --> 02:01:18.638
CAN HELP LOW INCOME HOMEOWNERS

02:01:18.704 --> 02:01:19.839
AND LOW INCOME RENTERS YOU'RE

02:01:19.905 --> 02:01:22.141
SAVING MONEY AT THE STATE LEVEL

02:01:22.208 --> 02:01:25.011
AND AT THE COUNTY LEVEL --

02:01:25.077 --> 02:01:26.445
AT THE CITY LEVEL --

02:01:26.512 --> 02:01:28.214
WITH ALL OF THE SERVICES AND WE

02:01:28.280 --> 02:01:29.348
SEE THIS AT THE HEALTH

02:01:29.415 --> 02:01:31.150
COMMISSION WE HAVE OUR ANNUAL

02:01:31.217 --> 02:01:33.386
REPORT WHICH SHOWS EXACTLY HOW

02:01:33.452 --> 02:01:34.954
MUCH WE ARE SPENDING AND

02:01:35.021 --> 02:01:36.489
SERVICES --

02:01:36.555 --> 02:01:37.556
WHETHER IT'S PARAMEDICS

02:01:37.623 --> 02:01:40.960
EMERGENCY ROOMS EMTS --

02:01:41.027 --> 02:01:42.895
THAT THE COST IS THERE --

02:01:42.962 --> 02:01:44.296
I NEVER WE'VE NEVER WOULD HAVE

02:01:44.363 --> 02:01:46.065
HAD THAT BILL SIGNED HAD WE NOT

02:01:46.132 --> 02:01:47.099
BEEN ABLE TO SHOW THAT IT WAS A

02:01:47.166 --> 02:01:48.834
FISCAL BILL AND I THINK IT'S THE

02:01:48.901 --> 02:01:50.536
SAME THING HERE. TO ANY EXTENT

02:01:50.603 --> 02:01:52.271
THAT YOU CAN GIVE HELP TO PEOPLE

02:01:52.338 --> 02:01:55.408
WHO ARE IN HOUSING CURRENTLY --

02:01:55.474 --> 02:01:56.842
TO STAY THERE AND TO PROVIDE

02:01:56.909 --> 02:01:57.810
WHATEVER ASSISTANCE YOU CAN

02:01:57.877 --> 02:02:00.379
YOU'RE ACTUALLY SAVING MONEY ON

02:02:00.446 --> 02:02:02.548
THE OTHER END.

02:02:02.615 --> 02:02:04.517
ANY OTHER COMMENTS QUESTIONS.

02:02:04.583 --> 02:02:07.687

02:02:07.753 --> 02:02:08.320

PROGRAM THAT WAS DE FUNDED IN

02:02:14.427 --> 02:02:14.994
TWO THOUSAND EIGHT SO WHAT IS

02:02:15.061 --> 02:02:17.730
KIND OF THE PLAN FOR THIS BILL.

02:02:17.797 --> 02:02:19.899
WHEN IS YOUR PLAN FOR THIS YOU

02:02:19.965 --> 02:02:21.167
MEAN AS FOR WHERE THE FUNDING

02:02:21.233 --> 02:02:23.269
WILL COME FROM YES?

02:02:23.335 --> 02:02:25.771
WELL IT DEPENDS.

02:02:25.838 --> 02:02:27.740

02:02:33.112 --> 02:02:34.714
BUT BUT GIVEN TO WHAT EXTENT

02:02:34.780 --> 02:02:37.383
THAT'S A POPULAR OPTION RIGHT

02:02:37.450 --> 02:02:39.819

TO BE THE VIABLE.

02:02:43.856 --> 02:02:45.524
OPTION MOVING FORWARD WHEN IT

02:02:45.591 --> 02:02:46.926
COMES TO HOUSING.

02:02:46.992 --> 02:02:50.496

THIS IS GONNA BE SOMETHING THAT --

02:02:55.501 --> 02:02:57.002
MAKES SENSE RATHER THAN SOME OF

02:02:57.069 --> 02:02:58.437
THE OTHER OPTIONS THAT ARE BEING

02:02:58.504 --> 02:02:59.705

TO SEE WHAT WHAT MOVES FORWARD --

02:03:06.011 --> 02:03:07.780
OTHERWISE.

02:03:07.847 --> 02:03:10.449
THE LAST OPTION IS TO PUT IN A

02:03:10.516 --> 02:03:12.852
REQUEST FOR FUNDING AS WELL.

02:03:12.918 --> 02:03:14.253

02:03:25.698 --> 02:03:27.233
THE CONVERSATION ON IT I'M

02:03:27.299 --> 02:03:28.701
SOMEWHAT SURPRISED THAT THIS HAD

02:03:28.768 --> 02:03:31.103
OF THIS HAD BEEN DEFINED IT AT

02:03:31.170 --> 02:03:32.972
THE TIME THAT IT DID.

GIVEN THE CIRCUMSTANCES I

02:03:48.387 --> 02:03:49.655
THOUGHT THAT THIS MIGHT BE.

02:03:49.722 --> 02:03:55.694
