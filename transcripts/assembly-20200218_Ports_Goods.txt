THE ASSEMBLY SELECT COMMITTEE ON PORTS AND GOODS MOVEMENT TO ORDER. THANK EVERYONE FOR BEING HERE TODAY A SPECIAL THANKS TO KILEY FROM FROM MY OFFICE TO PUT A LOT OF THIS IF NOT ALMOST ALL OF IT TOGETHER AND THIS ALL CAME ABOUT THROUGH A CONVERSATION WITH- MICHELLE GRUBS I DON'T KNOW SHE'S HERE. NO SHE MADE A PLANE THIS MORNING AND WAS VERY LONG AT THE AIRPORT I KNOW THAT BUT EITHER WAY- SO I WANT I WANT TO THANK THOSE TO SPECIFICALLY BUT ALSO EVERYONE IS HERE TODAY- THANK YOU- AS MANY OF YOU KNOW I REPRESENT THE PORTS OF LONG BEACH AND LOS ANGELES UP HERE. BUT THE TENTACLES OF THE PORTS GO FAR BEYOND THAT ONE THING I'M A I OFTEN SAY APPEARS OR SUPPORT IN EVERY DISTRICT. EVERY ASSEMBLY MEMBER EVERY STATE SENATOR RELIES. ON THE PORTS. BE IT TO MOVE THE GOODS OUT OF THEIR DISTRICT OR TO MOVE GOODS IN TO THEIR DISTRICTS SO AGAIN. OTHER PORTS ARE ARE KEY TO THE CALIFORNIA ECONOMY- THE EMPLOYEE OVER HALF A MILLION CALIFORNIANS AND GENERATE OVER NINE BILLION IN STATE AND LOCAL. ATTACK REVENUE EACH YEAR. AND THE ON THEIR ECONOMIC IMPACT PORTS ARE ALSO LEADING THE WORLD IN ENVIRONMENTAL INNOVATION. I REMEMBER A FEW YEARS BACK I WAS GOING TO THE PORT OF DUBLIN- AND- IN AS YOU ENTER THE PORTER DUBLIN SAID THE GREEN PART OF DUBLIN WOULDN'T SAY THE GREEN PORT OF DUBLIN BECAUSE THE PORT. WAS IN IRELAND CAME MY PEOPLE BUT I'M- IT SAID THE GREEN PORT OF IRELAND. BECAUSE THAT PART WAS GOING GREEN. AND THAT ALL STARTED IN LONG BEACH IN THE PORTS OF LOS ANGELES. HAS GROWN INTO REALLY- A WORLDWIDE CALL- TO GREEN IN OUR OUR PORTS BUT I WAS IN THE PORT CITY TO GO GREEN BUT THEY NEED TO MAKE GREEN. WELL THEY GO GREEN. BECAUSE THEY ARE INTEGRAL TO OUR ECONOMY THERE CERTAINLY ARE INTEGRAL TO MY DISTRICT. AND SO ALL ALL OF THAT IS. SO OVER THE PAST DECADE THE PORTS TO AND FREEDOM TO MOVE AN INDUSTRY AS HELP ACHIEVE MAJOR AIR QUALITY IMPROVEMENTS. OF THAT IS TRUE THERE IS MUCH CLEANER. THERE AT THE AT THE MISSIONS ARE MUCH REDUCE TO WE HAVE MORE TO DO YES BUT- SOMEONE SAY THE LOW HANGING FRUIT IT IS KIND OF BEEN. PULLED OFF THE TREE BUT I WOULD SAY WHEN THAT STARTED THAT WASN'T LOW HANGING FRUIT FOR THOSE OF US WHO LIVED THROUGH THOSE. EXPERIENCES IN THE THEN AGAIN THE WORK IS NOT DONE YET WE HAVE MORE TO DO. SO TODAY I KNOW SENATOR LOW- LEANING GONZALEZ IS GOING TO COME IN- SHE'S AT LEAST ON THE SENATE FLOOR SO WE'RE GONNA GO AHEAD INSTEAD OF WAITING- WE'RE GO HEAD FOR SEE BECAUSE I KNOW PEOPLE OF SCHEDULES THEY HAVE COMMITMENTS. AND COMMITTED TO BE HERE SO I WANT TO CERTAINLY- APPRECIATE EVERYBODY'S TIME HERE TODAY- I DO WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE ASSEMBLY MEMBER ELOISE REYES. WHO IS FROM THE SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA INLAND EMPIRE IF YOU WANT TO TAKE A MINUTE OR TWO JUST SHARE SOME THOUGHTS. RIGHT YEAH. THANK YOU MICHAEL DONALD AND HIS OTHER TODAY'S HEARING WHEN I THINK ABOUT PORTS I THINK ABOUT LONG BEACH. AND WE KNOW THAT PORT LONG BEEN GATEWAYS FOR GLOBAL TRADE ARE CRITICAL TO ECONOMIES AROUND THE WORLD. THEY ARE WITHOUT A DOUBT HUBS OF ECONOMIC ACTIVITY. BUT THEY'RE ALSO MAJOR SOURCE ESPECIALLY FOR MY COMMUNITY MAJOR SOURCE OF POLLUTION VEHICLE EMISSIONS. PORTS RELY ON A WIDE RANGE OF VEHICLES WITH ENGINES WHICH ARE A SOURCE OF GREENHOUSE GAS. AND CONTRIBUTE TO CLIMATE CHANGE. THE GOODS ARRIVING AT THE SPORTS THEN HAVE TO BE TRANSPORTED IN OFTEN THESE GOODS WILL GO THROUGH COMMUNITIES IN THE INLAND EMPIRE. TO THE CLUSTERS OF WAREHOUSES AND RAIL YARDS BEFORE BEING DISTRIBUTED TO THE REST OF THE COUNTRY. NOT ONLY THAT BUT THE POLLUTANTS CREATED LONG BEACH ARE THEN BLOWN EAST INTO THE NLAND VALLEYS AND ARE TRAPPED BY THE VALLEY CREATED BY THE MOUNTAIN RANGES. COMPOUNDING THE POLLUTION LEVELS TWO HORRENDOUS LEVELS THAT DISPROPORTIONATELY AFFECT THE INLAND EMPIRE COMMUNITIES. WITHOUT A DOUBT MY COMMUNITY. EXPERIENCE DISPARITIES IN HEALTH OUTCOMES ATTRIBUTED TO THE EXPOSURE THREE MISSIONS FROM THESE OPERATIONS. I REALLY APPRECIATE HOWEVER AND I STARTED ON SUCH A DOWN- BUT WE REALLY ARE SUFFERING IN THE INLAND EMPIRE BUT WE ALSO RECOGNIZE HOW IMPORTANT THE BUSINESS OF THE PORTS. HOW IMPORTANT THAT THAT BUSINESSES AND I APPRECIATE THE COMMENTS FROM MY COLLEAGUE THAT WHILE WE GO GREEN YOU ALMOST MAKE THE GREEN. AND THAT IS SOMETHING THAT I WILL KEEP IN MIND- I WANT AS A AND THE DISCUSSIONS THAT I HAVE HAD BOTH WITH MY COLLEAGUES FROM THE PORT AND WITH OTHERS IN THE TRUCKING INJURED IT INDUSTRY. AND OTHERS WITHIN THAT AREA ALL AGREE THAT WE DO NEED TO DO MORE AND I WANT YOU TO KNOW I WANT YOU TO COUNT ON ME AS A PARTNER AS WE MOVE IN THAT DIRECTION. I THINK IT'S GOOD FOR ALL OF US WHEN WE DO CONSIDER THE FACT THAT WE DO NEED TO GO GREEN BUT I WILL ALWAYS HONOR THE FACT THAT YOU WILL NEED TO MAKE THE GREEN WELL WE DO. GO GREEN. SO AS WE DISCUSSED THE IMPACT OF THE PORTS ON CALIFORNIA'S ECONOMY. I HOPE THAT WE WILL ALSO DISCUSS THE IMPACT OF THE PORTS. ON CALIFORNIA'S OUR QUALITY. AND RECOGNIZE THAT THEIR QUALITY SHOULD BE A PART OF ANY CONVERSATION WHEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE PORTS. THANK YOU. GREAT THANK YOU- IN WITH THAT WILL TURN OR PANELS AND- COVER PANELS TO DO THEIR BEST TO HAIR TO THE- TIME. THE OTHER FACTOR WE HAVE TIME CAN HERE IN THAT OUR GIVEN A CERTAIN NUMBER OF MINUTES TO SPEAK IF THEY GET KIND OF HARD TO THAT NUMBER THE BE GREATLY HELPFUL SO THAT EVERYBODY CAN HAVE A CHANCE TO PARTICIPATE EVERYBODY CAN HAVE A CHANCE TO HEAR WHAT SOME OF THE FOLKS HERE TODAY WANT TO SAY SO OUR FIRST US THE EARLY CHRISTIAN DICK SHE IS THE MEDIA PASTURE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION.

OVER SIXTEEN MILLION CONTAINERS OF AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTS. RAW MATERIALS AND FINISHED GOODS LIKE TELEVISIONS TOYS AND MORE. FLOW IN AND OUT OF CALIFORNIA PORTS EVERY YEAR. TOUCHING EVERY CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT IN THE CONTINENTAL US. CALIFORNIA'S ELEVEN COMMERCIAL PORTS ALSO PROVIDE NON CARGO RELATED SERVICES AND FACILITIES LIKE PASSENGER CRUISE AND VERY SERVICES RESTAURANT AND HOTEL ACCOMMODATIONS RECREATIONAL MARINAS PUBLIC WATERFRONT EVENTS AND TWO DOCKSIDE TOURIST ATTRACTIONS. ONE THIRD OF THE STATE'S ECONOMY RELIES ON GOODS MOVEMENT TO FACILITATED BY CALIFORNIA PORTS SUPPORTING FIVE MILLION CALIFORNIA JOBS SEVEN HUNDRED BILLION DOLLARS IN REVENUE AND NINE BILLION DOLLARS IN ANNUAL STATE TAX REVENUE. CALIFORNIA'S PUBLIC PORTS ARE ALSO COMMITTED TO MAINTAINING ENVIRONMENTALLY SUSTAINABLE OPERATIONS AND OVER THE PAST DECADE CALIFORNIA PORTS HAVE SUBSTANTIALLY REDUCED EMISSIONS ACROSS THE BOARD BETWEEN FIFTY AND NINETY PERCENT. CALIFORNIA PORTS ARE VITAL TO THE STATE'S ECONOMY AND OUR INVESTMENT IN MARITIME INFRASTRUCTURE HELPS TO CONTINUALLY GROW OUR NATION'S ECONOMY.

AND A THIRD OF ALL CALIFORNIA JOBS- DEPEND ON PORTS OF THESE ARE PRETTY BIG NUMBERS AN IMPORTANT TO POLICY DECISIONS THAT GO ON HERE IN SACRAMENTO. I MENTION THIS BRIEFLY BEFORE BUT WE ARE THE LEADERS LITERALLY THE LEADERS IN THE ENTIRE WORLD- ONLY PUSH GOT A PLUG A SHIP IN CALIFORNIA AND WE ARE LEADING THE WAY ON THAT TYPE OF TECHNOLOGY- AND AGAIN SEEING.

THAT'S MINE SHE EIGHT COMMERCE ALL THESE THINGS AND LOOK FOR THE WORKERS YEAH THE TO TAKE THANK YOU AND SO WE LOOK FORWARD TO THE NEXT COUPLE OUR WITH YOU TO TALK ABOUT THESE THINGS GREAT THAT I'LL TURN IT OVER TO THE GROUP OF RIGHT NOW BE BACK UP TO THE END THANK YOU VERY THANK I DID NOT MENTION THE BEGINNING THAT ARE MILLER- HAS BEEN VERY HELPFUL PUTTING TOGETHER AS WELL SO WE APPRECIATE HER HELP. WE'VE GOT A- WE'RE GONNA HAVE A PANEL THE- IS THE PORTS IMPACT ON CALIFORNIA'S ECONOMY ON THE CALIFORNIA ECONOMY. WELL FIRST HER FROM MIKE JACOB WHO IS VICE PRESIDENT. AND GENERAL COUNSEL THE PACIFIC MERCHANT SHIPPING ASSOCIATION. AND THE HORROR HERE FROM CHRISTIAN AUTUMN- VICE PRESIDENT GOVERNMENT AFFAIRS FOR CALIFORNIA TRUCKING ASSOCIATION CHRIS. AND THEN RAY FAMILY PRESIDENT INTERNATIONAL LONG SURE WAREHOUSE UNION LOCAL. THIRD THE MEN AND WOMEN ON THE- ON THE WATERFRONT WHO MOVED THE GOODS ON AND OFF. THE SHIPS. SO WITH THAT- WILL START WITH MISTER JACOB WHEN YOU ARE READY YOU MAY PROCEED THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN- IS THERE IS- PRETTY YOU HAVING US HERE TODAY AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR- YOUR STAFFS- WORK PUTTING THIS TOGETHER REALLY APPRECIATE. AND OF COURSE WE ALWAYS APPRECIATE ALL OF YOUR LEADERSHIP ON THESE. TOPICS THERE ARE A LOT OF OTHER ASSEMBLY MEMBERS THAT CAN START OFF A HEARING TALK ABOUT HOW THEY'RE VISITING PORTS AROUND THE WORLD BUT- YOU CAN- AND I DON'T THINK I'VE HEARD TO REPEAT THE SAME PORT. ONCE BECAUSE YOU'VE BEEN THE START. OF EVERY SHADE- YOUR INVESTMENT AND- AND EVERYTHING WITH MAKE OUR SEAPORTS WORK THE PROJECT THAT- WE DO WANT TO ADDRESS OUR QUICKLY AND I HAVE A COUPLE SLIDES AND SPEAK- RELATIVELY QUICKLY GO THROUGH. SOME OF OUR THINGS ARE GONNA BE FAMILIAR WITH- SOME OF THE NUMBERS ARE A LITTLE BIT NEW. THESE ARE OLD- SO THE CONTEXT FOR WHERE WE ARE NOW OBVIOUSLY IS THE HISTORY OF OUR GROWTH AND WHAT IT MEANS. SO FROM NINETEEN NINETY TO TWO THOUSAND SIX. LA LONG BEACH OAKLAND ALL- HAD VERY VERY ROBUST AND PROFOUND CONTINUOUS GROW PATHS. AND WHEN YOU WERE TO THOUSAND SIX REGULATOR POLICY GIRL UNDERWRITER OR REPORT I'M DOING TRANSPORTATION PLANNING- YOU PROJECTED OUT NUMBERS THAT LOOK LIKE THIS THESE ARE FROM THE- CALIFORNIA AIR RESOURCES BOARD SICA'S MOVING MISSION REDUCTION PLAN TWO THOUSAND SIX LOOKING AT CLOSE TO. A PER. OF THE WELL. A LOT MORE CONTAINERS THAN WE ACTUALLY MOVED SO WHAT ACTUALLY HAPPENED BETWEEN TWO THOUSAND SIX AND- TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN LAST YEAR'S NUMBERS. WERE LA LONG BEACH OAKLAND. ALL AROUND TOTAL THROUGHPUT. OF REPRESENTS ABOUT FIFTEEN MILLION CONTAINERS THAT WE DID NOT OF. THREE SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA- AND THAT'S REFLECTION OF. NOT JUST THE SLOWER GLOBAL ECONOMY AND TRADE BECAUSE IT DID SLOW DOWN A LITTLE BIT BUT IT'S PRIMARILY REFLECTION OF THE FACT THAT- WE'RE LOSING MARKET SHARE. AND A MACRO LEVEL WYRLEY LOSING MARKET SHARE. THIS I THINK PARAPHRASES- WHAT THE GOVERNOR TOLD CAMP. WE NEED TO BE REINVESTING IN OUR OUR INFRASTRUCTURE- BUT WHAT HAPPENS IS WHEN WE LOSE VOLUME AT THE SAME TIME WE INCREASE COSTS WHICH IS WHAT WE'VE BEEN DOING- YOUR COST PER BOX OBVIOUSLY GOES UP RELATIVE TO YOUR COMPETITION- AND WHAT HAPPENS THEN YOUR COMPETITIVENESS DECREASES YOUR VOLUMES GO DOWN WHEN YOU'RE VOLUMES GO DOWN. COST PER BOX GOES UP IT'S THE SORT OF THE VIRTUOUS CYCLE REINVESTMENT THAT WE ALL WANT. WE ALL WANT MORE CONTAINERS WHICH MAKE ADDITIONAL INVESTMENTS IN INFRASTRUCTURE ENVIRONMENTAL UPGRADES CHEAPER PER UNIT. AND WE'VE BEEN MAKING THE MORE EXPENSIVE PER UNIT. SO AS A RESULT OF ALL OF THAT IF YOU LOOK AT THAT THAT CHART THIS AGAIN FROM NINETEEN NINETY TO TWO THOUSAND SIX WE WERE STEADILY GAINING NOT JUST TOTAL THROUGHPUT BUT ALSO MARKET SHARE THIS IS A MARKET SHARE COMPARISON- FOR TOTALLY WEST CONTAINERS ON THE TOP IN TOTAL NORTH AMERICAN. PAINTERS ON THE BOTTOM- POST DOESN'T SIT GIVEN MOST OF IT BACK SO WE ARE NOT. MOVING AS MUCH AS OTHER PORTS AND WHEN YOU LOOK AT IT WILL BREAK IT DOWN THAT THE GREEN LINES AT THE BOTTOM ARE. SAN PEDRO BAY IN OAKLAND- OUR COMPETITORS SAVANNAH OTHER AT CANADIAN WEST COAST PORTS- VIRGINIA NEW YORK NEW JERSEY THERE ARE GROWING MUCH FASTER. AND SO YOU KNOW WHEN YOU LOOK AT THAT ON A ON A COASTAL BASIS THIS IS- WE TOOK THIS FROM- PRESENTATION- I JUST MARKET SHARE. I'M SORRY I AM AT MY AGE AS MARKET COMPARISON MARKET SHARE- AND YOU CAN SEE THE US WEST COAST COAST MARKET SHARE THAT GREEN BAR GOING DOWN. SINCE TWO THOUSAND EIGHT AND WE'RE LOSING- OVERALL MARKET SHARE TO EAST COAST IN A LITTLE BIT TO THE GULF COAST- SO. MOVING FORWARD WHEN WE'RE DOING PLANNING POLICY NOW THIS WAS TAKEN FROM A DRAFT SEAPORT ANY EXERCISE AT THE CDC THE BACON PROVISION BELLMAN COMMISSION THERE. LOOKING AT- FLOWS FOR PLANNING WHAT HAPPENS ON THE BAY AREA IN TERMS OF INVESTMENT AND NEW SEAPORT INFRASTRUCTURE- AND YOU CAN SEE THAT OUR OUR TOTAL COASTAL SHARES OF LOADED IMPORTS ON PACIFIC WEST THIS IS NOW BELOW 50% UP AND ALONG FOR A- YOU KNOW. FIFTH SEVEN FIFTY EIGHT PER SO THAT'S DRAMATIC AND THEN. I THINK TO THAT THE POINT OF A MADE BY BOTH AND THAT YOU'RE UP OR- THERE'S A COST TO LIEU. A SHARE THE OBVIOUSLY THEIR COSTS THE KEEPING MARKET SHARE WE- REALLY DO APPRECIATE THE FACT THAT THERE ARE NEGATIVE EXTERNALITIES WITH WHAT WE DO AND WE'RE SPENDING A LOT OF MONEY AND TIME AND ENERGY. TO ADDRESS THOSE THINGS- A HER FROM KRISTIN BECAUSE THE TOTAL OVERALL EMISSIONS REDUCTIONS WE THINK ARE ARE. SOMETHING THAT WE'RE VERY PROUD OF. THEIR SIGNIFICANT- WE'RE ALSO REALLY PROUD OF THE JOB KNOCKED BENEFITS THE COME WITH WHAT WE DO. SO IN LA EVERY FOR CONTAINERS TO COME THROUGH THAT'S A JOB. A TWO AND A FIFTY DOLLAR PER CONTAINER STAY LOW TAX. THAT IS REAL BENEFIT TO THE STATE. NOT TO MENTION THE INDIRECT BENEFITS OF ACTUALLY ALL OF THE PERSONAL INCOME THAT COMES FOR CONTAINER AND IN OAKLAND IT'S THREE JOHN- EVERY THREE CONTAINERS YOU SEE JOHN. AND SO WHAT ARE WE LOOKING AT AND WHY AS A MATTER- WELL IT IF WE'RE NOT COMPETITIVE WE'RE GONNA GROW SLOWER THAN WE NEED TO. AND WE WILL BE MISSING OUT ON ALL THESE BENEFITS WILL BE MISSING OUT ON STATE IN TAX REVENUES- WILL BE MISSING OUT ON JOBS TO BE MISSING A PERSONAL INCOME. SO THESE WERE THE LAST COUPLE OF FORECAST FROM- 200-072-0009 THAT WERE DONE- IN LA LONG BEACH- AND THEN WE'RE LOOKING AT A NEW FORECAST IN TWENTY SIXTEEN. YOU CAN SEE WHERE WE'RE TRACKING- WE MISSED OUR OUR TWO THOUSAND SEVEN FORECASTS WERE MISSING OR TWO THOUSAND NINE FOUR CATS WERE TRACKING OUR LOW FOR US. FOR TOTAL TO EAT SINCE PETER BACK THAT'S CONCERNING TO US. THE SAME- TRENDS ARE ARE PROJECTED FOR PORT OF OAKLAND YOU CAN START ON WOULD BE. FANTASTIC IF WE COULD MOVE SEVEN MILLION TEAS WITH VOCAL ABOUT MAYES. WELL MICHAEL ADELINE IT'S GOING TO FIVE MILLION T. THROUGH TWENTY WHICH IS A DOT OF TOLL THROUGHPUT RIGHT NOW ARE ABOUT POINT FIVE BUT RIGHT NOW WE'RE TRYING TO DOWN TOWARDS OUT LINE WHICH DOES NOT EVEN GETS TO THE PLACE WHERE OUR MEMBERS HAVE ALREADY THEN COSTS AND PLEASE. THAT SLOW WINE BOTH HERE IN ST PETER BAY AND IN OAKLAND DOES NOT COVER MINIMUM GAIL MINIMUM ANNUAL GUARANTEED GROWTH. IN MOST LEASE REVENUE- AT THE PORTS- AND THAT'S WHERE OUR MEMBERS ARE ARE MAKING AN INVESTMENT TOWARDS MAKING SURE WE'RE REINVESTING IN INFRASTRUCTURE- AND THEN BEFORE I TURN OVER TO- CHRISTEN RAY- JUST. TO POINT OUT SO BE CDC AND DOING THIS FOR THE PORT OF OAKLAND THIS IS ON CONTAINERIZED TRAFFIC WITH YOU FORECAST. ALSO DID A FORECAST FOR ROAD ROSE- AND US AT THE PORT OF OAKLAND BUT IT'S- A- PART OF. ALBANY JOHN RICHMOND AND OBVIOUSLY THE FLOWS ARE VERY SIMILAR AND PART OF SAN DIEGO ON WINE AMY- YOUR- CUMULATIVE GROWTH YEAR OVER YEAR AND BOTH THE SLOW. AND ME MODERATE WITH. THOSE THREE FIFTY IS JUST OVER 1% A IT IS NEW PROJECTED THE EX WERE AND SO THAT THAT'S A CHALLENGE FOR US- AND ON THE DRY BOOKS SIDE TO EVEN THOUGH THOSE THOSE CURVES GO WAY UP ON- ON DRY BULK BUT YOU'RE REALLY LOOKING AT IS A RELATIVELY SMALL. PERCENTAGE OF GROWTH OVER TIME- IF YOU ARE NOT IN A MODERATE OR HIGH GROWTH ENVIRONMENT- THESE ARE VERY LOW MARGIN ACTIVITIES WITH RESPECTABLE GOODS- BUT THEY ARE GOOD JOBS AGAIN THEY'RE VERY STUDY ONCE YOU HAVE A BALK OPERATION AND YOU CAN KEEP IT. IT'S A IT'S A STEADY SOURCE OF WORK UP AND DOWN THE SUPPLY CHAIN. SO WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THE AGAIN WE ARE GROWING- BECAUSE IT LOWERS OUR AVERAGE COST PER BOX ARE MARGINAL COST FOR OUR CUSTOMERS- IT LEADS TO A VIRTUOUS CYCLE REINVESTMENT OF FOR GROWING CONTAINERS WE HAVE MORE MONEY TO INVEST BOTH- AND THE INFRASTRUCTURE SIDE AND FOR NEW FACILITIES BUT ALSO ON THE ENVIRONMENTAL SIDE BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT IS AS WE HAVE TO INVEST IN NEW EQUIPMENT THAT'S MORE EXPENSE OVERTIME IN NEW INTEREST SUPPORT AND WE HAVE TO GROW UP AND THEN FINALLY OBVIOUSLY WE WANT TO. BESIDES ALL DAY LONG IT'S A TAX BENEFITS GROWTH WELL. SO THANK VERY. BRIDGE AND. SO GET AFTERNOON CHAIRMAN OF IN SIMILAR MEMBER IS THANK YOU FOR IT MY NAME IS CHRIS OUT OF QUE TRUCK ASSOCIATION AND THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK-HERE TODAY I'D LIKE TO ECHO MISTER JACOBS- APPRECIATION TO THE CHAIR FOR HIS LEADERSHIP ON- ISSUES RELATED TO THE PORTS AND GETS MOVEMENT- THE IMPORTANCE OF CALIFORNIA SEA PORTS TO OUR ECONOMY IN THE TRUCKING INDUSTRY CANNOT BE OVERSTATED. FOR A DEPENDENT INDUSTRIES ARE ESTIMATED TO ACCOUNT FOR ONE THIRD OF THE STATE'S ECONOMY AND JOBS AND MUCH OF THIS ACTIVITY FLOWS DIRECTLY THROUGH REPORTS WITH SANTA FE PORTS ALONE HANDLING VOLUMES APPROXIMATELY TWENTY THOUSAND TRUCKERS SERVE CALIFORNIA'S PORTS ALL IN AG EXPORTS FROM THE CENTRAL VALLEY DOZEN FOR ASIAN MARKETS. IMPORTER MATERIALS THE CALIFORNIA MANUFACTURERS IN EVERYDAY GOOD YOU'RE NOT RELY UPON. OUR TRUCK BENEFIT THE FREE FLOWING NOW ON INTERNATIONAL IT MADE POSSIBLE BY CALIFORNIA PORTS SO SIX THAT IS AN ARRAY CALIFORNIA WITH THE ONE EIGHT MILLION STAGE. LICENSED OPERATE HERE THESE TRUCKS ARE OPERATED BY THE INDUSTRY'S MOST VALUABLE ASSET THE BACK ON OF THE GOOD GOVERNMENT SYSTEM THE PROFESSIONAL TRUCK DRIVER TRUCKING IS CONSISTENTLY RANKED ONE OF THE BEST PAYING JOBS FOR WORKERS WITH COLLEGE EDUCATION PROVIDING WORKING CLASS CALIFORNIANS WITHOUT ADVANCED DEGREES A PATHWAY TO CLASS. CALIFORNIA ALSO HAS A MAJORITY MINORITY DRIVER WORK FORCE ACCORDING TO ET'S LABOR MARKET INFORMATION CALIFORNIA DRIVER WORKFORCE 52% LATINO 6% AFRICAN AMERICAN. 6% A- IN. SUPPORT THE COMPACT AND AS A BONUS PORTS SUPPORTS BLUE COLLAR MIDDLE WERE. ON THE SUSTAINABILITY FROM. ELF PORTS ARE HOME TO THE CLEANEST FLEET IN THE COUNTRY. IN TWO THOUSAND TWELVE THE ORIGINAL LOS ANGELES AND LONG BEACH CLEAN TRUCK PROGRAM BAND PRE TWO THOUSAND SEVEN TRUCKS IT TOOK SEVEN YEARS FOR SEAPORT OUTSIDE OF CALIFORNIA TO ADOPT THAT SAME REQUIREMENTS. NEARLY ONE BILLION DOLLARS HAS BEEN INVESTED TO UPGRADE TRUCKS RESULTING IN A 97% REDUCTION AND DIESEL EMISSIONS THE MOST OF ANY SECTOR SERVICING THE PORTS. PORT TRUCKERS HAVE ALSO BEEN PIONEERS IN THE TESTING OF ZERO NEAR ZERO MISSION TRUCKS FOR OVER A DECADE AND CONTINUE TO PARTNER WITH PORTS MANUFACTURES AND AGENCIES TO PUSH THESE TECHNOLOGIES FORWARD. WITH REGARDS TO THE COMPETITIVENESS OF CALIFORNIA'S PORTS OVER THE NEXT TEN YEARS AS MR JAKE POINTED OUT THERE ARE REASONS FOR CONCERN- PORT DATA INDICATES THAT CALIFORNIA'S MARKET SHARE HAS SLIPPED TO QUOTE A RECENT ECONOMIC STUDY COMMISSIONED BY THE PORTS OF LOS ANGELES. IN BEACH REGARDING TO DISCRETIONARY CONTAINER VOLUME AND I QUOTE. NUMBER AFTER THAT YOU TO KLEIN TRAFFIC MANY WHICH CAN BE EXPLICITLY. CALPERS THAT THE PORT OF LOS ANGELES AND LONG BEACH ARE UNRELIABLE. FACTOR CITED BY THE STUDY FALL INTO ROUGHLY FOUR CATEGORIES. CONGESTION OR LACK OF EFFICIENCY- LABOR UNCERTAINTY A PROLIFERATION OF FEES AND CALIFORNIA'S STRICT ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATIONS. OUR MEMBERS PROVIDED US FEEDBACK FOR THE COMMITTEE ON SOME OF THESE TOPICS. WHILE MANY EFFICIENCIES ARE AYE SILENT PRIVATESTAKEHOLDERS IN AND WE ARE COLLECTIVELY WORKING ON THESE ISSUES THERE'S BROAD SUPPORT FOR STATE AND FEDERAL INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENT. IN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN OF CALIFORNIA TRUCKING ASSOCIATED SUPPORTED SB ONE IN PART TO PROVIDE DEDICATED FUNDING FOR TRADE CORRIDORS ENHANCEMENT. THOSE FUNDS MUST CONTINUE TO BE INVESTED IN PROJECTS TO INCREASE SUPPLY CHAIN VELOCITY RELIABILITY AND THROUGHPUT. ADDITIONALLY ANY MAJOR NON MARITIME PROJECTS PLANNED AT OR NEAR PORT SHOULD BE DESIGNED TO ENSURE MINIMAL IMPACT SUPPORT OPERATIONS. ON THE TOPIC OF FEES ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATIONS THE STAMPEDE REPORTS ARE CURRENTLY CONSIDERING THE ADOPTION OF A NEW ROUND OF CLEAN TRUCK FEES TO SUBSIDIZE THE PURCHASE OF ZERO AND YEARS ARE AMERICAN TRUCKS. TO MEET THEIR GOALS ALL OF HAPPENED A EMISSION PORT TRUCK WE BY THE YEAR. TWENTY THIRTY FIVE. OUT FOR TERRORIST WHAT IS ALSO ANNOUNCED ITS INTENT. TO DOT NEW REGULATIONS. THE PURCHASE OF ZERO MISSION PORT TRUCKS AS EARLY AS NEXT YEAR. THESE NEW INITIATIVE THEY SHOULD HAVE MUST BE BALANCED BY THESE CONSIDERATIONS FIRST. CALIFORNIA ALREADY HAS THE NATION'S CLEAN A SPORT TRUCK FLEET WHICH WILL GET SIGNIFICANTLY CLEANER DID ALREADY ADOPTED REGULATIONS. SECOND THE CHARGING INFRASTRUCTURE TO SUPPORT pTRUCKS WERE REQUIRE SIGNIFICANT UTILITY INVESTMENT IN MUST BE CAREFULLY PLANNED FOR. THIRD ZERO MISSION TRUCKS AS THEY STAND TODAY WILL NOT BE ABLE TO SERVICE FOR TRUCKING NEEDS FOR INSTANCE SUPPORT TRUCK. AND PORTABLE MAY NEED SAME PETER BAY PORTS MAY NEED TO GET ALL THE WAY OUT AND ABOUT ERRORS ON A- FINALLY. ZERO NEAR ZERO EMISSION TRUCK INCENTIVE PROGRAMS ARE UNDERFUNDED AND OVERSUBSCRIBED WE ENCOURAGE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE TO CONTINUE TO WORK- SUPPORT CLEAN TRUCK INCENTIVES AND WORK WITH STAKEHOLDERS TO STRENGTHEN THEM. THEY WILL ABSOLUTELY BE NEEDED TO ADVANCES TECHNOLOGY I LIKE TO THINK THAT SELECT COMMITTEE FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK TODAY AND LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH TO CHEAT SHARED. ECONOMIC AND ENVIRONMENTAL GOALS AND I'M I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY OF THE COMMITTEE'S QUESTIONS. THANK YOU. FOR FAMILY. THANK YOU GOOD AFTERNOON MISTERCHAIR AUDIBLE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS RAY FAMILY AND I'M THE PRESIDENT OF THE INTERNATIONAL LONG SHORE WAREHOUSE UNION LOCAL THIRTEEN I'VE GOT A GREAT HONOR OF APPEARING TODAY ON BEHALF OF MORE THAN EIGHT THOUSAND UNION MEMBERS WHO WORKED TIRELESSLY IN THE PORTS OF LOS ANGELES ALONG BEATS TO MAKE CALIFORNIA ECONOMY COMPETITIVE. AS MANY OF THE OTHER VIEWS THE PROGRESSIVE LABOR UNION THAT REPRESENTS LONG FOR WORKERS ALONG THE WEST COAST WE ARE VERY PROUD OF OUR LONG HISTORY AND TRACK RECORD OF ADVOCATING FOR WORKERS' RIGHTS INCLUDING THE RIGHT TO WORK IN A SAFE ENVIRONMENT AND THE RIGHT TO EARN FAIR WAGES AND BENEFITS TO THAT END THE I'LL W. SUPPORT SOCIAL POLITICAL AN EX COP. WORK HARD TO ENSURE CALIFORNIA'S PORTS ARE COMPETITIVE WE BELIEVE THE FIRST AND MAIN WAY IN CALIFORNIA'S PORTS CAN STAY COMPETITIVE IS BY MAINTAINING CREATING JOBS FOR WORKERS- THAT ALL OF CAL IN ALL OF CALIFORNIA SPORTS DOING SO IS CRUCIAL FOR THE HEALTH OF OUR LOCAL ECONOMY AND THE ECONOMY OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. THIS CAN BE ACCOMPLISHED BY IN PART BY RETAINING THE WORK FORCE AND INVESTED IN TRAINING RECENTLY THERE HAS BEEN AN OVERALL DID DEPRIEST IN CARGO COMING THROUGH OUR NATION'S PORTS DUE IN LARGE PART TO THE ARE TRUMP ADMINSTRATION'S UPS. THESE HOWEVER THIS WE CONTINUE SEE CARGO FLOWING THROUGH OUR PORTS IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN THE PORT OF LOS ANGELES SAID IN A NEW ALL. TIME CARGO RECORD BY MOVING MORE THAN MORE CARGO IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN THAN ANY TIME IN ITS HUNDRED ELEVEN YEAR HISTORY. FURTHER IN TWENTY NINETEEN THE PORT OF LONG BEACH AT ITS SECOND MOST PRODUCTIVE YEAR ARE IN ITS HUNDRED NIGHT HIS. AS WORKERS LOADED AND UNLOADED- SEVEN MILLION SIX HUNDRED AND THIRTY TWO THOUSAND- T. E. USE ARE COMPARED WITH THE EIGHT MILLION. NINE HUNDRED NINE NINE. EXCUSE ME EIGHT MILLION NINETY ONE THOUSAND. AND TWENTY THREE TWO YEARS IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN. HOWEVER WE MUST ALL WORK TOGETHER TO ENSURE CALIFORNIA SPORTS STAY COMPETITIVE AND NOT LOSE OUR MARKET SHARE TO THE EAST COAST OR GULF COAST PORTS. IN IN OUR PORTS. DO THAT IF OUR PORTS TO ATTRACT CARGO OUR WORKFORCE WILL ON A NEGATIVELY IMPACTED. A SECOND WAY TO STAY COMPETITIVE IS BY INSURING THAT REAL RATES ARE REASONABLE CURRENTLY IT COST ABOUT TWO HUNDRED DOLLARS MORE TO MOVE A CONTAINER- IN THE WEST COAST- THEN AN EAST COAST AND GULF COAST. A THIRD WAY TO STAY COMPETITIVE REQUIRES THE ENTITIES SUCH AS CALIFORNIA AIR RESOURCES BOARD NOT. OVER REGULATE OUR PORTS OVER REGULATION BY CARP INCREASES THE COST FOR OPERATIONS THAT ARE PORTS AND MAY IN TURN DISPLACED WORKERS. YOU CAN BE DIVERT THE OUR OUR COMMUNITIES WHILE ALSO MAINTAINING JOBS CURRENTLY CARD. AS A GOAL THAT. THAT ALL IMPORT ALL THE EQUIPMENT AT THE PORT SO BE ZERO OR NEAR ZERO EMISSION. WHEREAS THE PORTS OF LOS ANGELES AND LONG BEACH WE'VE ADOPTED THE SAME PETER BASS CLEAN AIR ACTION PLAN TO REDUCE POLLUTION. FROM DIFFERENT SOURCES THE I'LL BE SUPPORTS OUR COMMUNITY IS BEING BRAIN HOWEVER WE CANNOT END UP WITH REGULATIONS THAT WILL LEAVE PEOPLE UNEMPLOYED. CALIFORNIA CANNOT AFFORD TO SEE COMMUNITIES LIKE DETROIT OF THAT WERE DEVASTATED BY UNION AUTO WORKERS LOSING THEIR JOBS FARMING I WOULD LIKE THANK YOU ALL. THE REST OF THE LEGISLATURE FOR CONSISTENTLY SUPPORTING THE I'LL W. BY ALLOCATING FUNDS TO THE PORTS FOR CLEAN EQUIPMENT AND ENSURE IN. PUBLIC ARE NOT CONSIDERED PLACE TELEPHONE WORKFORCE. GOING FOR WE ARE COMMITTED TO WORKING WITH THE LEGISLATURE ARTS AND EMPLOYERS AND ALL STAKEHOLDERS TO FIND ADDITIONAL WAYS TO STAY COMPETITIVE THANK YOU. THANK YOU THANK YOU UP JUST QUICKLY JUST A QUESTION OR TWO BOB. FOR A MISTER JACOB YOU YOU YOU YOU YOU SEE THE VOLUME MIGHT BE UP OF MIKE ITS MARKET SHARE MIGHT BE DOWN COULD YOU JUST EXPLAIN THAT DYNAMIC YEAH I THINK REYES SPOKE TO A LITTLE BIT AND BUT IT'S A QUESTION- SO. OUR OUR UP COMPARED TO WHERE WE WERE PRE RECESSION. BUT IT'S TAKEN OVER A DECADE FOR US TO GET THERE AND IN THE MEANTIME OUR COMPETITORS HAVE BEEN GROWING FASTER. SO WE ARE- HITTING A STRIDE AND I THINK YOU'LL HEAR FROM SOME OF THE PORT DIRECTORS IN THEIR PANEL- THAT WE'RE VERY PROUD. OF THE WORK WE DONE TO RICK IN THE CARGO WE HAVEN'T GROW. AT THE RATE WE HAVE- BUT- WE HAVEN'T BEEN REINVESTING IN. PORT INFRASTRUCTURE LIKE OUR COMPETITORS HAVE WE HADN'T BEEN RAN- IN INVESTING IN TAX CREDITS FOR. SHOULD BE XIN CENTERS AND THINGS LIKE THAT UP. STREAM THAT ATTRACT MORE CARGO FASTER- LIKE SOME OF OUR COMPETITORS STATES HAVE- AND IT IT IT'S A CHALLENGE- AND SO YOU KNOW WE DO HAVE A DICHOTOMY. WHERE YES WE'RE VERY PROUD OF THE FACT THAT WE'RE STILL GROWING- BUT WE ARE GROWING AS FAST AS WE NEED TO CATCH UP. WITH BOTH OUR INTERESTS. GO THANK YOU MISTER FROM ARE YOU YOU YOU YOU ALLUDED TO OTHER STATES OR MAYBE ANOTHER STATE ADOPTING SOME OF THE CALIFORNIA LIKE REGULATIONS AND I REGULATIONS CAN BE GOOD BUT NO SONGS ARE COUPLED WITH INNOVATION WE CAN'T JUST REGULATE WE NEED TO INNOVATE AND WE'VE DONE A LOT OF THAT REPORTS COMPLEX IF YOU WANT TO SEE A THING THAT'S HAPPENED. ON OF TOP TO BOTTOM GO TO THE PORT. ALL HAVE THEIR IN SPECIFICALLY- WE TALK ABOUT GOOD WHEN WE TALK ABOUT TRUCKS. OUR WHAT IT WHAT ARE OTHER STATES DOING ON THE TRUCKING FINER THEY TECHNOLOGY NEUTRAL OR THEY ALL I MEAN THEY WERE NOT THERE ON THE ELECTRIC FRONT YEAH WE WERE GOING TO GET THERE I THINK. BUT THE WE THE WAY WE SHOULD ALLOW OTHER ALLERGIES TO DEVELOP OR WHATEVER OTHER STATES DOING ALONG IF YOU JUST. SURE NO OTHER STATE HAS ADOPTED. ANYTHING CLOSE THE CALIFORNIA'S PORTFOLIO OF ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATIONS THE TOP PART THAT I WAS ACTUALLY REFERRING TO WAS SEATTLE TACOMA. WHICH DID TRAIL- THE PORTS OF LA AND LONG BEACH BY SEVEN YEARS ON THE BANNING OF PRE TWO THOUSAND SEVEN TRUCKS. OTHER STATES. YOU KNOW THAT THIS IS SORT OF SOMETHING THAT CALIFORNIA HAS DONE WELL CALIFORNIA DOES. A PUT. STATE FOR. SOURCES TOWARDS PILOTS IN THEM. NATION YOUR MISSION. AND THAT WE ALL. ARE A HAPPY ACRE. ON CERTAIN ASPECTS OF OUR POLICIES. SUCH AS- GETTING UTILITY INVESTMENT IN. CHARGING STRUCTURE. OFFER TRANSPORTATION. AND HOWEVER MOST OTHER STATES ARE TAKING MORE OF A- YOU KNOW THE- CARE. THE STATE PRO. WITH ITS INDUCED. ALL IS WHERE A- I THINK THE SICK IS. VERY RAPIDLY. CHAIN MORE. BUT THESE AREAS YOU KNOW AND I. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT THAT WOULD BENEFIT- THE SYSTEM AS A WHOLE IS KEEPING IN- IN AYE TOWARDS THE PLACES WHERE THIS TECHNOLOGY WITH WHAT IT CAN DO TODAY. AND WHAT ARE THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN ELECTRIC CHARGING AND JUST GOING UP TO A FUELINGSTATION TO GET A TAKE A DIESEL- MEAN AND IF WE CAN CONCENTRATE TIME AND EFFORTS IN MAKING SURE THAT THE TECHNOLOGY WORKS- WORKS TO DEAD. RECIPE FOR SUCCESS AND NOT CHIU HORNADY AND IN- THE STREET IT'S NOT QUITE READY. THANK THANK YOU AND I. PRESENT YOU YOU. YOU IT IS. SAID AND YOU. YOU WILL MAKE SURE THAT WE DON'T CREATE GREEN POVERTY HERE IN CALIFORNIA MY REGULATING THESE INDUSTRIES OUT. AND THEY HAVE TO MOVE TO ANOTHER STATE AND ALL THE JOBS MIGHT BE THERE AND I THINK YOU. YOU YOU LET ARE TRIED IS BEING SAMPLE OF SOMETHING LIKE THAT HAPPENING IN IN IN IN OUR NATION'S HISTORY. REALLY AND YOU TALKED ABOUT SOME INVESTMENTS IN TRAINING COULD YOU COULD YOU. TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THAT YES- INVESTMENT IN TRAINING RIGHT NOW AS THE TECHNOLOGIES ARE BEING IMPLEMENTED IT'S IMPORTANT WE BRING THE WORK FORCE TO THE FUTURE. AND NOT. SLOWLY WE NEED TO RAPIDLY AS QUICKLY AS THIS INDUSTRY. NEEDS TO CHANGE- I MENTION CARB. OF CARBS OF GOAL OF A ZERO EMISSION OR NEAR ZERO. BY TWENTY THIRTY- WE'RE DOING EVERYTHING WE CAN WE SEE WITH THE INDUSTRY'S DOING BUT IN THE MEANTIME. I'VE GOT COMING OPERATORS RIGHT NOW THAT ARE TALKING WITH PMSA IN A- OPTICAL INDUSTRY. ABOUT A WEEK. HYBRID NOW. WE CAN GET OUR TWO JEEZ IN THE EIGHT PER. FOR ME. TODAY AND THAT WE DON'T HAVE TO. CAPITAL IN EQUIPMENT THE THAT. ISN'T GONNA. BENEFITS. WHERE THE DOT MICHAEL IN YEARS BETWEEN NOW TWENTY THIRTY WE GOT SO MUCH WORK TO DO BUT WHAT CAN DO IT AND STILL. ARE RETAIN JOE AND CLEAN THE- BUT WE'RE GONNA NEED CARBON OTHER FOLKS TO. PROBABLY BE- I HAVE A DIFFERENT CONVERSATION WE'RE HAVING TODAY. THANK YOU. SIR IS THIS FIRST DID YOU HAVE ANY. THE ONE THING THAT I'VE BEEN READING A LOT ABOUT IS THIS AUTOMATION IN THE PORTS. AND IT IS OF GREAT CONCERN ESPECIALLY WHEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT OUR WORKERS- CAN YOU TALK A LITTLE BIT TO THAT MR FAMILY. AUTOMATION'S AVAILABLE THERE'S A HUGE COST A HUGE CAPITAL EXPENDITURES THE ONLY REASON- YOU'VE GOT THE LARGEST TERMINAL OPERATOR IN THE PORTS OF LA LONG BEACH. AUTOMATING RIGHT NOW IS BECAUSE THEY HAD DEEP POCKETS THERE THE LARGER SHIPPING COMPANY IN THE WORLD MASK. THEY WROTE A LARGE CHECK- THE OTHER- STEVEDORE. COMPANIES TERMINAL OPERATORS MANY DON'T HAVE THE FINANCIAL RESOURCES AT THIS TIME TO AUTOMATE THAT'S WHY EVERYONE'S LOOKING. CONSCIOUS OF MY LABOR FORCE WHEN I HEAR THE TRUCKERS TALK ABOUT TRUCK TURN TIMES AND MOVING THE GOODS TO MARKET WE KNOW WHERE WE NEED TO MAKE THE IMPROVEMENTS BUT IN THE SAME TIME. NOT EVERYBODY- IN THE INDUSTRY HAS THE FINANCIAL RESOURCES- TO INVEST IN AUTOMATION AND I BELIEVE THAT- A LITTLE BIT OF TECHNOLOGY CAN GO A LONG WAY IN IMPROVING. OF THE- IS THAT WE NEED TO IMPROVE IN RIGHT NOW AND I THINK IF I MAY JUST JUMP IN ONE OF THE THINGS AND I'M CONCERNED ABOUT FROM THE STATE LAW. IS AT WE- THAT. THAT TIME SO. YOU'RE A REGULATORY AGENCIES PICK A TECHNOLOGY IN OTHER WORDS THEY'RE NOT TECHNOLOGY NEUTRAL. FOR EXAMPLE LECTURE VACATION LECTURE OCCASION CAN OFTEN MEAN AUTOMATION. AND SO THAT'S WHY WE NEED TO BE VERY COGNIZANT OF THESTATE LEVEL THAT WE'RE CREATING WISE POLICYTHAT IS TYPICALLY TECHNOLOGY NEUTRAL SO THAT INNOVATION CAN HAPPEN ON THE GROUND WE CAN MOVE. YOU KNOW IF WE CAN BE AS- LEAST. MOVED SO THAT THAT'S ONE OF THINGS WE PUSHING EVEN FOR STRONG A STRONG VOICE ON THE AUTOMATION FRIEND DOWN OF THE PORT A LEVEL DOWN THE SPEED OF YOUR WORKFORCE QUITE FRANKLY YES YES THAT'S RIGHT I APPRECIATE THAT VERY MUCH THAT YOU ARE SPEAKING FOR YOUR WORKFORCE THE COMMENT THAT YOU MADE WE MUST ALWAYS AT THE RIGHT TIMES IT ALL.

LET ME BEGIN WITH HOW THE FREIGHT SECTOR COMPETES PORTS COMPETE FOR CONTAINER TRAFFIC TO ACCESS DISTRIBUTION CENTERS. AND THE REGION'S COMPETE FOR DISTRIBUTION CENTERS WHICH AFFECTS CONTAINER TRAFFIC AT THE PORTS. FOR CALIFORNIA PORTS ARE SEEN INCREASES IN TENER VOLUMES. GROWTH AT THE- EAST COAST GULF AND THE CANADIAN PORTS IS OUTPACING CALIFORNIA'S GROW THEIR MANY FACTORS FOR THIS INCLUDING THE PANAMA CANAL EXT EXPANSION. INCREASED USE OF THE SUEZ CANAL. OF THE COST IN OF LAND AND LABOR IN CALIFORNIA AND CENTERS OFFER BY OTHER STATE GOVERNMENTS TRUCK PARKING SURCHARGES ALSO IMPACT WORKING HOURS FOR TRUCKERS TO HELP ALLEVIATE TRUCK PARKING ISSUES CALTRANS IS BEGINNING A STATEWIDE TRUCK PARKING STUDY. WHILE THERE SEEM TO BE A LOT OF HIS WITH KEEPING PORTS AND GOODS MOVING COMPETITIVE THERE ARE A LOT OF OPPORTUNITIES TO OPTIMIZE THE GROWTH IN CALIFORNIA ESPECIALLY WITH THE PASSAGE OF SB ONE.

AND WE'LL HAVE COME FORWARD- MARIO CORDERO EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE PORT OF LONG BEACH. AND KRISTIN DAVIS- CEO AND DIRECTOR THE PORTAL I NEED ME. AND JEFF WINFIELD- DIRECTOR OF OUR ENVIRONMENTAL AND PUBLIC AFFAIRS FROM THE PORT OF STOCKTON. AND I PPRECIATE THE FACT THAT WE HAVE A HORSE STOCKTON HERE BECAUSE I SEE MARIO IN TOWN I KNOW HIM. THE CHRISTIAN SUMMER SO OFTEN BUT WE'RE GOING TO HEAR MORE FROM STOCKTON. OKAY CURRENT. HONESTLY I JUST YOU KNOW I KNOW WHY HE'S BEEN VERY ENGAGE THE PORT ISSUE SO AS THE LA AND LONG BEFORE WE NEED TO HEAR FROM STOP AND WE NEED TO HEAR FROM WEST SACRAMENTO WE NEED TO HEAR FROM FROM FROM SAN DIEGO AS WELL I DON'T CAP WAS- SOME PLANS OF THE BILL ON THE STATE GETS RUNNING AS ROBERT THING THAT EVERYBODY'S. ARE PARTICIPATING TO ALTER OVER TOMORROW I WAS THE EXECUTIVE IS THAT WHO'S GONNA GO FIRST MARIO OKAY. I THINK THE ORDERS. OKAY MY MARK FUTURE OKAY YOU MAY GO YOU MAY PROCEED THANK YOU CHAIR AND LIKE THE THANK MEMBERS AND STAFF OF THE COMMITTEE OF. THE THING THIS AFTERNOON REGARDING COMPETITIVE IN THE NEXT DECADE IS VERY UPPER POLL PARTICULARLY IN THIS PARTICULARLY IN THIS POINT IN TIME AS MY- THE PRIOR SPEAKERS HAVE COMMENTED. FOR LONG BEACH WE ARE THE GREEN PORT. AND THE SECOND BUSIEST PORT IN THE UNITED STATES ALONG WITH LOS ANGELES HAS BEEN REFERENCE THIS IS THE NATION'S LARGEST SUPPORT COMPLEX. FOR THE POOR LONG BEACH WE MOVE A PUNCH ME TO HUNDRED BILLION WORTH OF CARGO EACH YEAR. LET ME TAKE OVER SOME TIME PERIOD NOTE A COUPLE OF OUR ACHIEVEMENTS ONE AS HAS BEEN REFERENCE IN TERMS OF THE PORTS. AND WITH A BIG PLAYER THEY ARE IN JOB PRODUCTION. HERE AT THE POOR LONG BEACH- WE LOOK AT THE STATE LEVEL. UGH JOBS THAT COME FROM THE PORT OPERATIONS. DIRECTOR INDIRECT SUPERSEDE SEVEN HUNDRED FIVE THOUSAND JOBS YOUR TONGUE BUT IT INDUSTRY THAT'S A SIGNIFICANT JOB PRODUCER. WITH THAT THERE'S ANOTHER GREAT ACHIEVEMENT THAT WE'VE DONE AS PORTS. AND THAT IS BY WAY OF OUR CLEAN AIR ACTION PLAN WHICH COMMITS BACK IN TWO THOUSAND SIX. AND THAT CLEAN AIR ACTION PLAN RESULTED AND MORE PERSONAL TACKLED THE HARMFUL EMISSIONS FROM POOR OPERATIONS AND WHAT THAT RESULTED IS AN 87% DECREASE IN PARTICULAR MATTER. REDUCTION AND SOCKS. THAT'S THE TREMENDOUS QUESTS THAT THIS INDUSTRY NEW SPORTS HAVE DONE. GOING FORWARD WE NOW HAVE THE TWENTY SEVENTEEN CLEANER ACTION PLAN. AND THE PORTS ARE CONTINUING WITH THEIR ENVIRONMENTAL STEWARDSHIP WE'RE NOT JUST REDUCING EMISSIONS OUR QUEST NOW IS TO E. RATHER KATE EMISSIONS WE'RE MOVING TOWARDS ZERO EMISSION CARGO HANDLING EQUIPMENT. AND ZERO EMISSION TRUCKS. WITH REGARD TO THE FORMER THAT'S TWENTY THIRTY IN A TO THE TRUCK TRANSPORTATION INDUSTRY THAT'S TWENTY THIRTY FIVE WE DID THIS BY WAY OF COLLABORATING WITH VARIOUS STAKEHOLDERS IN THE PORT COMPLEX TRUCKERS MARINE TERMINAL OPERATORS. SHIPPERS TECHNOLOGY DEVELOPERS AND I GIVE THIS BACKGROUND. BECAUSE YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT THE CALIFORNIA PORTS WHO HAS SPENT SIGNIFICANT FUNDS IN CORPORATE RESPONSIBLE CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY TO ACCOMPLISH A MANDATE THAT NO OTHER POOR COMPLEX INDEED ON THE STATE'S HAS EVEN ATTEMPTED TO ACHIEVE. NOW LET ME. OUR MARKET SHARE ISSUE. AS WAS REFERENCE AT THE BEGINNING OF THIS HEARING THE GOVERNOR INDICATED THAT CALIFORNIA MUST INVEST IN OUR COMPETITIVENESS AGAIN I CANNOT STRESS ENOUGH TO THIS COMMITTEE HOW IMPORTANT THAT IS AT THIS POINT IN TIME. THE COMPETITION IS GULF AN EAST COAST PORTS. AND AS YOU'VE ALREADY SEEN THE RESPECTIVE GRASS AND CHARTS UP WE'RE LOSING MARKET SHARE HERE IN CALIFORNIA AND IN THE SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA PORTS. YOU KNOW I MENTIONED LOS CHALLENGES NUMBER ONE LAW WHICH IS NUMBER TWO. NEW YORK NEW JERSEY IS RIGHT ON OUR HEELS. OF SO I THINK THIS IS IMPORTANT WHEN WE TALK ABOUT HOW TO BE ADDRESS IS COMPOSED OF ISSUE WHICH I BELIEVE. AND I CANNOT STRESS ENOUGH THAT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA SACRAMENTO NEEDS TO CHIME IN ON THIS QUESTION BECAUSE WE DO NEED YOUR HELP. THIS IS NOT JUST AN ISSUE IN TERMS OF THE COMPETITORS AS A RESULT OF. THEIR MANY FACTORS BEST NOT JUST BECAUSE OF WHAT'S HAPPENING IN DC IN RELATION TO THE TRADE WAR. THE IT'S NOT GUARD TO OTHER ASPECTS THAT THE OF COME INTO PLAY IN THE MOST RECENT ONE OF COURSE THE- CROWN OF OURS. ENTER THE WHAT THAT IMPACT MAY HELP ON THE SUPPLY CHAIN. OF GOING FORWARD. LOTUS IS ALSO WITHIN THE CONTROL OF THE PORTS AND WE'RE DOING EVERYTHING WE CAN TO REMAIN COMPETITIVE. BUT AGAIN I CAN'T STRESS ENOUGH HOW IT'S IMPORTANT FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE. WE DO KNOW THAT BECAUSE OF THE LEADERSHIP IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. WE ARE THE FIFTH LARGEST ECONOMY IN THE WORLD. AND A LOT OF THAT IS DEPENDENT BECAUSE OF THE FACT THAT WE'RE BIG PLAYER INTERNATIONAL TRADE. SO WITH THAT. I THINK THE ACTION THAT WE ARE. THE REQUESTED OF THIS COMMITTEE IS TO BRING THAT DIALOGUE FORWARD AT THE HIGHER STATE LEVEL- IN A WAY IN WHICH AGAIN. COULD HELP ADDRESS THESE FACTORS SOME OF THESE FACTORS HAVE BEEN ALREADY REFERENCE JUST FROM OUR RESPECTIVE HERE- SPEAKING FOR A POOR LONG BEACH AND POOR LOS ANGELES. YOU KNOW WE ARE PLACING GREAT EFFORTS WITH REGARD TO OUR SERVICE. OUR COSTS. AND ALSO AGAIN YET A DYNAMIC WITH REGARD TO THE LOSS OF MARKET SHARE IS THE INCREMENTAL MOVEMENT OF CARGO. MANUFACTURING IT IS FROM CHINA THE SOUTHEAST ASIAN. IT ALSO WITH THE WHAT'S VERY IMPORTANT ABOUT OF A FACTOR HERE OR FACTORS IS WHAT ARE OTHER COMPETITORS HAVE DONE ARE THE PORES NEW YORK NEW JERSEY VIRGINIA SAVANNAH. A HOUSTON AND A CHARLESTON. THESE ARE ALL PORTS WHO HAD INVESTED OF. MILLIONS AND MILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF INVESTMENT AND OF COURSE THE POLITICAL WILL BEHIND THAT IT THIS MEANT. IS VERY STRONG SO SUFFICE IT UP FOR CALIFORNIA. I THINK WE ARE IN INFECTION POINT WITH REGARD TO OUR COMPETE. TERMS OF THIS INDUSTRY ME TO THE STATE. NOW SOME OF OUR CHALLENGES. LET ME RESPECTFULLY THAT I THINK ONE OF OUR CHALLENGES IS REGULATION IN THE STATE MORE SPECIFICALLY WHAT'S WHAT WE SEE AT THE CALIFORNIA AIR RESOURCE BOARD. OF THE BOARD- AND I SAY THIS AS A PIONEER POOR LONG BEACH AND LOS ANGELES WE ARE PIONEERS IN TERMS OF STATEMENT ABOUT. SHORE PARTY WE'VE INVESTED MILLIONS OF DOLLARS WITH REGARD TO SHORE POWER TECHNOLOGY. HOWEVER AT THIS POINT. HARPER IS INTENDING TO MOVE WITH A PROPOSED RULE TO FURTHER LIMIT AT BIRTH EMISSIONS WITH REGARD TO OF OIL TANKERS AND RURAL VESSELS IN WHICH THE TECHNOLOGY THERE IS NOT HERE TO DO THIS AT A POINT IN THE TIMELINE THAT CARP WHICH TO DO SO. AND THUS I WOULD ASK THAT THIS COMMITTEE ASK OURSELVES THE QUESTION OR AXIS OF THE QUESTION WHETHER WE COULD UP THE LADY THE CARD TO PLAY REGULATION ANOTHER TWO YEARS OF THE YEARS THAT WORK IN ABOUT HIS TWENTY TWENTY FIVE. TWENTY SEVEN THAT TO BE TWENTY SEVEN TWENTY TWENTY NINE WITH THE GUARD AGAIN TO THAT'S IT IMPACTS WILL ROLL VESSELS AND OIL TANKERS SO SUFFICE TO SAY THAT THE TECHNOLOGY WITH REGARD TO WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE AT ALBERT'S EMISSIONS THERE. IS NOT IS NOT AVAILABLE NOW THERE ARE A COUPLE ENTITIES THAT HAVE BEEN CERTIFIED TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE BUT AGAIN IN TERMS OF WHETHER THEIR MARKET A COMMERCIALLY AVAILABLE AT THIS POINT THE ANSWER IS NO. SO THIS IS RATHER CHALLENGING BECAUSE AGAIN WITH REGARD TO THE MANY OTHER FACTORS IN TERMS OF. WHAT THIS STATE REGULATORY AND MAY BE DOING TO SUPPORT OUR THEORY MISSION QUEST IN FACT. HAS A HINDRANCE WITH REGARD TO OUR COMPETITIVE A CHALLENGES HERE AS PORTS IN THE STATE. WELL WE CERTAINLY WANT APPRECIATE WHAT THE STATE HAS DONE WITH REGARD TO CAP AND TRADE AND WE CONTINUE TO ENCOURAGE THAT THE PORCH PLACE A PRIORITY WITH REGARD TO THE FUNDS NECESSITATED TO MOVE FOR WITH OUR ZERO EMISSION GOAL. A SECOND ANOTHER ISSUE THAT AGAIN HAS A POSITIVE ENVIRONMENTAL FOOTPRINT IS OUR INVESTMENT ON TALK RADIO SO WE KINDLY RESPECTFULLY REQUEST THAT FURTHER FUNDING BE WRECKED TO SPECIFICALLY TO RAIL SERVICE MOVE CONTAINERS. OF A RAIL. AND I WILL SAY THAT THE TRUCKING WILL ALWAYS BE A COMPONENT IN THIS MOVEMENT OF GOOD. BUT THE MORE WE PUT ON RAIL THE MORE EFFICIENT WE BECOME AND AGAIN ANOTHER GOAL TERMS ARE TO CITY. POLLUTION FOOTPRINT. A WORKFORCE HAS BEEN RUN ALREADY HAVE. AGAIN I WANT TO ENCOURAGE THE COMMITTEE TO LOOK INTO THIS VERY IMPORTANT ISSUE PARTICULARLY IN THE TIME THAT WE'RE MOVING. MORE TOWARDS- TECHNOLOGY WHICH IF. WE DON'T TAKE OF A GOOD LOOK AT HOW WE DO THIS AND IMPLEMENT FUNDING FOR WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT IS GOING TO IMPACT JOBS IN THE STATE. AND IN THE LONG TERM AGAIN WE ALL KNOW THE WHOLE QUESTION ABOUT ROBOTICS. AND AUTOMATION IN TERMS OF. A THIS IS MOVING IN OUR GLOBAL. BUT ON THE OTHER HAND AGAIN WE NEED TO THE AGAIN INVEST IN WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT SO AT LEAST WE CAN HELP. AND PROTECT THAT JAR MARKET OF THE FUTURE. OF. HOLLY WE DONE THIS AT THE PORT TO ADDRESS THE MARKET SHARE- JUST A COUPLE WEEKS AGO I GAVE THE STATE REPORT HERE TO POOR LONG BEACH AND FOR ME I SEE THIS AS THE YEAR OF COLLABORATION AND YOU'RE ALREADY SEEING THAT COOPERATION AND IS THE COURSE WITH THE WORLD RULES THE UNIONS WITH MANAGEMENT AND HERE IN THIS PARTICULAR CASE THE PORTS ARE LIKE THE COLLABORATORS TO THE CALIFORNIA TO ADDRESS. JUST A COMPETITIVE. WHICH I IS SOME ECONOMY BUT TO. LET'S MOVE A VERY. WAY IN TERMS OF HOW BE ACCOMPLISHED AS SHE REMISSION GOAL WHICH AGAIN I WANT TO EMPHASIZE THESE TWO PORTS ARE ABSOLUTELY ON BOARD IN TERMS OF WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE. TO ADDRESS THE HARMFUL EMISSIONS AND MOVE TOWARD ZERO. AND I DON'T WANT TO GET RID OF IT BUT THERE IS NO OTHER INDUSTRY IN THE STATE. THAT HAS A RESUME IN TERMS OF WHAT WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO DO TO SIGNIFICANTLY DECREASE HARMFUL EMISSIONS MORE POOR OPERATIONS. UP SO AS I CLOSE HERE I WANT TO. AGAIN THANK GOAL IS ANOTHER OF THE UNIT SO OF THE GOAT OFFICE IN TERMS OF EFFORTS. HEARD OUR PRIOR SPEAKER HERE ADDRESS THAT ISSUE. OF WE ARE VERY EXCITED ABOUT WORKING WITH GOAL BILLS TURN TO THIS QUEST TO ADDRESS COMPETITIVENESS. AND WITH THAT I WILL CLOSE AT THIS TIME IN TERMS OF MY COMMENTS BUT AGAIN I JUST WANT TO STRESS HOW IMPORTANT IS THE COMPETITIVE ATMOSPHERE HERE. IN REGARD TO THE PORTS AND THIS IS NOT UNLIKE THE TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN ACTION PLAN A MISTER CHAIRMAN WHICH YOU ARE VERY MUCH PART OF THAT IN TERMS OF. THE POLITICAL WILL URGING LONG BEACH TO AFFORD WITH THAT KIND OF PLAN OF ACTION NOW IN TWENTY TWENTY THE SHIPPERS HAVE CHOICES. AND IF WE DON'T TO MOVE IN A PRAGMATIC- I'M AFRAID TO SAY THOSE CHOICES WILL MOVE AGAINST THE INTERESTS OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IT WILL IMPACT OUR ECONOMY. AND OF COURSE BACK JOBS HERE IN THE STATE THANK YOU SO MUCH. THANK YOU THANK YOU JUST JUMP OFF THAT LAST POINT. AND THAT WILL FLY IN THE FACE OR COMPETITION MENTALLY. IF THEY GOT OTHER STATES IN OTHER REGIONS AND DON'T HAVE THE GREEN. FOR LACK OF A BETTER TERM RICK. AND WE HAVE ON. OUR ON ON THE ON THE ON THE GOOD MOVE IN INDUSTRY IN CALIFORNIA. SO WITH THAT WILL GO TO MYSTIC US. FROM THE POOR WHITE ANY. OKAY GOOD AFTERNOON AGAIN- AS I SIT UP HERE AND REPRESENTS THE PART WHEN HE ME BUT I THINK IT'S ALSO FAIR TO THAT AT I COULD SAY THAT I REPRESENT ALSO THE PART OF SAN DIEGO AND THE OTHER CALIFORNIA PARTIR BUT WE SHARE THE NICHE MARKET OF AUTOMOTIVE. AND A FRESH PRODUCE AND A SUPPLY CHAIN COACHING CARGOES MOVE THROUGH OUR PORTS. JUST KIND OF FROM A HIGH LEVEL VIEW THE PORT ECONOMY WHEN THE ME MUCH LIKE YOU HEARD HERE FROM MARIO I THINK YOU'LL SEE CONSISTENT THREAD WE REALLY ARE THE BACKBONE OF OUR LOCAL ECONOMIES WERE THE FOURTH LARGEST EMPLOYER. IN VENTURA COUNTY WE MOVE NINE POINT FIVE BILLION IN CARGO SUPPORT OVER FIFTEEN THOUSAND JOBS AND TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED OF THOSE ARE DROPPED JOBS- SO IF YOU LOOK AT ME LIKE OXNARD WHERE YOU HAVE. TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND PEOPLE AND THEY ARE THOUSAND SET LIPS COME TO WORK. CLEARLY WERE IMPORTANT THAT. IT'S FACE. ANY PERSON. DAY AND LOOK OUT. GOOD BOB. THE STATE JOB BECAUSE AT THE PORTS THE ARE THE TYPES OF JOBS THAT WE CREATE TAPE AVERAGE OF BROKE JOB AB AROUND SEVENTY DOLLARS A YEAR SO THESE ARE PAYING AND VERY POOR TARA KHAN ME WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE ENVIRONMENTAL FOOTPRINT I THINK WE'LL HEAR FROM ALL OF US ARE COLLECTIVELY A VOICE ON PORTS OF WHAT WE'VE BEEN DOING AND THE INVESTMENTS THAT WE'RE MAKING TO PUT OUR MONEY WHERE OUR MOUTH IS. REPORTED WHEN HE ME IS JOINED A PROGRAM CALLED DURING MARINE WHICH IS A THIRD PARTY VALIDATOR COMES IN AND AUDITS ARE PORT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE NOT JUST PUTTING HERSELF IN THE BACK AND TELLING OUR GREEN AS RATIONALLY HAVING SOMETHING LIKE AN ENERGY STAR COME IN. AND TELL US HOW WE THAT TESTED WE GET CERTIFIED IN THAT YEAR OVER YEAR WE GET VOTED AT THE GREEN SHIPPING SUMMIT AS THE NUMBER ONE THREE IMPORTANT A COP FOR YOUR VERY PROUD OF THAT ACCOLADE BUT WE'RE ALL UP THERE DOING THESE SORTS OF THINGS WE ALSO GOT SOME SENSE OF MONEY WERE INVEST IN THAT. ELECTION CALL INFRASTRUCTURE BUT OUR PART. BUILDING G. MANAGEMENT PLAN AT MUCH LIKE LA LAW TO OPEN ANOTHER PORTS WERE BUILDING A CLEAN AIR PLAN DIRECT PARTNERSHIP WITH OUR ON AIR QUALITY CONTROL BOARD. THE PORT ARE JUST SANTEE. AND WHEN WE ARE VERY. ABOUT THE NEXT ITERATION OF THE- GUIDELINES CA THROUGH A R. B. BECAUSE OF THE IMPLICATIONS ON ROW ROW AND THE COMPETITIVENESS THEY ARE- IF YOU LOOK AT ROBO FLEETS THEY TEND TO CONSIST OF AS MANY AS A HUNDRED AND FIFTY SHIPS THE GOING. GLOBAL TRADE LANES AND ARE GONNA. FIT A HUNDRED FIFTY SHIPS AT THE TUNE OF A MILLION DOLLARS PER SHIP TO FOLLOW. ME RICH IN SAN DIEGO SO. WE'RE ALL AGAINST AS WE LOOK AT THESE REGULATIONS COMING INTO PLAY AND HOW IT IMPACTS OUR OVERALL COMBAT IT COMPETITIVENESS. ON THAT SAID. BASED ON WHAT YOU KNOW WHAT YOU'VE HEARD US IS THAT WE ARE ALL AND WE WANTED TO THE GREEN THING WE'RE WILLING TO DO IT BUT WE JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE DOING IN A WAY THAT IS SUSTAINABLE AND FEASIBLE. AND SO I'M NOT NAY REITERATE THE GOOD POINTS THAT MARIO MADE BUT I WOULD LIKE TO TALK A LITTLE BIT AT THE POLICY LEVEL WHERE I THINK THAT THE STATE COULD DO SOME THINGS THAT COULD. HELP THE DIFFERENCE ON. IN ONE SUCH AREA THERE'S A QUESTION ABOUT POWER. SO WE'RE MOVING TO THE ZERO MISSION ECONOMY. DO YOU REALLY HAVE THE POWER LOCALLY TO SUPPORT THAT ZERO MISSION ECONOMY WELL WE'VE BEEN ASKED AND PASSED BY OUR LOCAL SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA EDISON COMPANY UTILITY COMPANY TO PAY DO CONDUCT A HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLAR STUDY. SEE IF THEY CAN MEET. THE OUR MANDATE OF A. R. B. AND I DON'T KNOW THAT'S FAIR TO PUT THAT ON THE BACKBONE OF THE PORTS. FOR US TO FIGURE OUT IF THE STATE HAS SUFFICIENT POWER TO FUEL- THIS MOVEMENT TWO ZERO EMISSION SO HOW CAN WE AT THE STATE LEVEL KIND OF DO SOME SORT OF ASSESSMENT. WE HAVE WHAT WE NEED AT THE UTILITY LEVEL DO ALL THESE. ON IN IN ZERO EMISSION MANDATES ON THE PORT SYSTEM FROM WHAT WE KNOW AT THE VERY ONSET OF OUR DISCUSSIONS WITH SOUTH SEVEN CALIBER. CALIFORNIA EDISON WE MAY HAVE TO INVEST AS MUCH AS SEVENTY MILLION DOLLARS JUST FOR THE NEXT. ITERATION OF THE GUIDELINES SO THIS IS A VERY REAL ISSUE THAT WE NEED TO TALK ABOUT IN HOW WE ARE GOING TO. REALLY COME UP WITH THE POWER WE DON'T CREATE BLACK AT ALL THROUGHOUT BEEN TORE COUNTY BECAUSE- OF EMISSION REDUCTIONS AT THE PORT SO THERE HAS TO BE- CONVERSATION THERE ARE WE REALLY NEED TO BRING THE UTILITY. COMPANIES AND ALSO WANT TO JUST QUICKLY ON THE TERRACE. I'M RIGHT NOW WE HAVE THIS STATION A PORTABLE GAMING. AND WE HAVE POWER COMES IN THEY ALL LET US USE THAT. FOR PLUGGING IN. SHORT SIDE POWER. SO WE'D LIKE TO WORK WITH THE REGULATORS HERE IN SACRAMENTO IS HOW COULD WE GET. SOME FLEXIBILITY INTO THE CPUC TERRA TO USE THAT POWER FROM SUBSTATIONS FOR OTHER THINGS- WE HAVE A CRANE RIGHT NOW THAT WE CAN'T PLUGIN. BECAUSE OF THE TARIFF ISSUE ELECTRIC GREEN AND ELECTRIC CRANES SO IT'S RUNNING ON DIESEL NOW BUT IF WE COULD AMEND THE CHERUB SO WE COULD USE. THE POWER OF THAT SUBSTATION I IT WOULD GO A LONG WAY AND THERE ARE ALSO ISSUES OF THE CPC TARIFF RATES AND THAT ONCE YOU SO MUCH. AS YOU IN THESE EGREGIOUS. SO THEN CAN WE WORK WITH OUR LOCAL REGULATORS C. P. YOU SEE THAT THE UTILITY COMPANIES TO MAKE SURE THAT. THE FEES ARE FAIR AND THAT WE CAN USE POWER THAT WE HAVE- AVAILABLE FOR EXISTING TECHNOLOGIES AND THEN MAKE SURE DOWN THE ROAD AS WE'RE GOING THROUGH WITH ALL THESE MANDATES WE DID HAVE ENOUGH. POWER TO FEEL WHAT IS BEING ASKED OF US. ARMED AND THEN- ONE OTHER AREA WERE ALL PLAYING FOR GRANTS YOU TALKED ABOUT SOME OF THE PROBLEMS YOU KNOW WITH THE- BONNET TECHNOLOGY I THINK YOU WERE SPEAKING TO THAT'S NOT VERIFIED FOR THE ROW ROW. WELL WE'RE STILL GOING TO ASK FOR THESE GRANTS BECAUSE IT'S EXPENSIVE TECHNOLOGY AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL IF THERE'S SOME WAY THE STATE COULD HELP WITH TODAY YEAH. YOU'RE GOING. TO DO THESE. SO YOU COULD HELP US MAKE OUR GRANTS COMPATIBLE FOR FEDERAL FUNDING. I THINK THAT WOULD GO AWAY LONG WAY LIKE THE EPA DEAR GRANTS YOU HAVE TO HAVE VERIFY TECHNOLOGY WILL THEY WON'T EVEN CONSIDER. TECHNOLOGIES THAT WERE PUSHING HERE IN CALIFORNIA BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT VERIFIED SO IF THERE'S SOME WAY TO. MARRY UP WITH THE FEDS ARE ASKING FOR AND WITH THE MANDATES ARE HERE IN CALIFORNIA SO WE CAN ACTUALLY AWESOME AT. AXIS FEDERAL FUNDING I THINK THAT WOULD BE VERY HELPFUL IN THE POLICY DISCUSSION WE CAN HAVE THE STATE LEVEL. AND THEN FINALLY JUST AS WE'RE LOOKING AT EMPLOYEE AND- TING A VARIETY OF RULES AND DRIVE. INS AT PERTH REGULATIONS CARGO HIT ME QUIT AND ALLEGE. STRATEGIC MUNY ELATION HARPER CRAP REGULATIONS. OF THINGS ARE MOVING AT THIS TIME IT FOR AN INTERNAL CONVERSATION AT A OR B. T MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE ALL COHESIVE IN ON PAGE NOT. IT'S NOT THE YOU KNOW THAT THE- SOUP IS WHAT IS STUPID THREE. WORKING AND IT TASTES GOOD TO GET ALL THE INGREDIENTS IN THESE RULE MAKING SO THAT THERE CAN. GO HE SAID THAT MAKES SENSE. BECAUSE FROM EXPERIENCE I THINK THE PORTS THAT HAVE BEEN REGULATED WE CAN TELL YOU. WHAT WE HAVE NOW IS EVEN A CHALLENGE. BY WAY OF EXAMPLE THE SUREST POWER SYSTEMS- ONLY HAVE ONE MANUFACTURE OF THE TECHNOLOGY IT HAS ONE MECHANIC. AND WROTE FIGHTING OVER RESOURCES TO MAKE SURE THEY FIXED YET WERE. HEAVILY MANDATED SO. I LET'S FIX WHAT WE HAVE IN PLACE NOW AND MAKE SURE IS THESE RULE MAKINGS ARE IN THE PIPELINE THAT. THIS CALL HE- YES AND- IT'S ALL. EXCEPT SPEAK FROM A TECHNOLOGY STANDPOINT EMPOWER STANDPOINT AT. ROOMMATE STANDPOINT. AND WITH THAT COMMA. I WANT TO THANK YOU AGAIN FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP I'M NOT CUT COMING UP YOU'RE QUITE BUT JUST TO HAVE HONEST DISCUSSION. ABOUT THE CHANGES THAT WE CAN MAKE. TO MAKE SURE WE BONTA. MONEY THAT FELT PORTS OUR. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. GREAT THANK GLAD TO BE AT THANK YOU FOR OPPORTUNITY TO SAYS FIVE YOU. JUST TO ALL GIVE YOU A LITTLE BIT ABOUT ON THE TO STOCK IT ALL THE PORTS FILL CERTAIN NICHES AND WITH PORTER STOCKTON WE ARE A BALKAN BREAKABLE PORT. UNLIKE THE OTHERS YOU SEE HERE TODAY WE DON'T HAVE CONTAINERS AT OUR FACILITY WE SPECIALIZE IN BUILDING MATERIALS SUCH AS CEMENT AND STEEL. AGRICULTURE PRODUCTS SUCH AS DRY AND LIQUID FERTILIZERS AND AS WELL AS WE EXPORT CALIFORNIA RICE ALL OVER THE GLOBE. OVER THE PAST YEARS WE'VE AVERAGED APPROXIMATELY FOUR MILLION METRIC TONS OF CARGO. AND WE SAVE APPROXIMATELY TWO HUNDRED FIFTY VESSEL CALLS PER YEAR. THAT MAY NOT BE A LOT IN TERMS OF THE VOLUME COMPARED WITH A THREE PORTS ARE TOP REPORTS OF LA LONG BEACH IN OAKLAND. BUT FOR STOCKTON AND SAN JOAQUIN AREA THAT'S TREMENDOUS AND SPECIALLY THIS IT'S THE THERE'S BEEN HIT HARD ECONOMICALLY AND- WE SUPPORT OVER TEN THOUSAND GOOD FAMILY WAGE PAYING JOBS IN THAT AREA WHICH- ALLOWED TO BE CONSIDERED THE TOP THREE THREE JOB PROVIDERS FOR THAT AREA. CURRENTLY OP ON TWO THOUSAND ACRES AFTER ACQUIRING OF ROUGH AND READY ISLAND FROM THE NAVY IN NINETEEN NINETY NINE- IF YOU'VE DRIVEN BY THE PORT ON I FIVE YOU PROBABLY SEE A VERY SMALL SLIVER AND SO WE'D WELCOME ANYBODY. THAT'S TO COME BY WILL SHOW YOU ALL THE- THE BACK PORTIONS AND- THE MANY ACRES AND A LOT OF THE GREAT THINGS THAT WE ARE THAT WE ARE DOING THEIR- SOME OF OUR BIGGEST CHOP. THE COMPETITIVE IN THE NEXT DECADE AND I DON'T WANT TO SOUND REDUNDANT SO I'LL START OFF WITH SOMETHING COMPLETELY DIFFERENT AND THAT IS- MAINTENANCE DREDGING- A- LOT OF THE PORTS. IN THE BAY AREA RELY ON MAINTENANCE DREDGING TO BE EFFICIENT AND TO MOVE GOODS- THE WAY WE NEED TO MR HARBOR MAINE INSTAX. THE ISSUER. IT'S SO THE HARBOR MAINTENANCE TAXES SUPPOSED TO GO BACK INTO A FUND THAT SUPPORTS MAINTENANCE DREDGING SUPPOSED TO IT'S SUPPOSED TO MUCH LIKE THE GAS TAX WE DON'T SEE A LOT OF IT COMING BACK TO- TO THE DONOR STATES IN. AND THAT'S A WHOLE NOTHER CONVERSATION BUT- BUT WHAT WE WOULD BE USED TO DREDGE THAT- THAT WOULD BE FUNDING FROM THAT- FROM THAT. FUND WOULD WOULD COME BACK TO US TO BE ABLE TO DREDGE BUT IT'S NOT JUST THE FUNDING IS TO RIGHT NOW FUNDING IS. WE'RE GETTING A LOT RELIABILITY AND PER AND AS WELL AS FUNDING AND SOME YEARS IS REALLY ARE OUR BIGGEST ISSUE- OUR CHANNELS OFFER AUTHORIZED TO THIRTY FIVE FEET DEEP. AN OFTEN WE OPERATE. AT MINUS THIRTY TWO FEET. FOR WEST SACRAMENTO THEIR AUTHORIZED IN TO MINUS THIRTY FEET MANY TIMES THERE AUTHOR OTHER OPERATING IN THIRTY OR TWENTY SEVEN FEET OF WATER. WORKING WITH THE CORPS OF ENGINEERS TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY GET THEIR CONTRACTORS IN THE WATER BETWEEN AUGUST FIRST TO NOVEMBER THIRTIETH EVERY YEAR IS IT IS A CHALLENGE FOR US AND WE HAVE WORKED WITH THE STATE AND WE GOT SOME DREDGING FUNDING THROUGH SB ONE A COUPLE YEARS AGO- TO DREDGE WHAT WE CONSIDER THE LOCAL SERVICE AREA AND WAS VERY SUCCESSFUL AND WE WOULD REALLY LIKE TO DANCE TO OPPORTUNITY TO TALK TO YOU MORE ABOUT ABOUT FILLING IN AND POTENTIALLY WORKING WITH THE WITH US TO ASSIST WHEN THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT CANNOT. EITHER GET THERE WITH FUNDING OR RELIABILITY. AS AS WAS MENTIONED BEFORE. ANOTHER UPCOMING REGULATION THE AT BIRTH REGULATION IS A BIG CONCERN FOR US- YOU KNOW. WE HAVE ALL PUBLIC BIRTHS WE DON'T HAVE TERMINAL OPERATORS AND SO THE PORT ITSELF WILL BEAR TE COST TO PLACE THESE. BONTA SYSTEMS BECAUSE WE ALSO WE'RE NOT GONNA BE ABLE TO PLUG IN ANY THE VESSELS THAT COME TO THE PORT OF STOCKTON THESE ARE TRAPPED VESSELS THAT COME. IN A ONE TWO THREE TIMES A YEAR AND THEY'RE NOT GOING TO MAKE THE INVESTMENT TO. INSTALL THE INFRASTRUCTURE NEEDED FOR SHORE POWER. SO THEN WE'RE LEFT WITH THE BONNET SYSTEM THAT'S THERE SO WE WOULD HAVE TO CONFIGURE ALL OF OUR BIRTHS WITH THIS BONNET SYSTEM. AND OUR CHANNELS NARAL SO WE'RE NOT GONNA BE ABLE TO UTILIZE A BARGE THAT CAN MOVE AROUND AND SO. THE INVESTMENT IS SIGNIFICANT AND WITH. YOU KNOW WITH. THE TECHNOLOGY THAT'S THERE. WERE VERY CONCERNED ABOUT WHAT THAT'S GOING TO DO OUR BUSINESS- RIGHT NOW JUST IN THE BACK OF A BACK A ENVELOPE THE COST THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT ARE. MORE THAN TEN ARE WHARFAGE COSTS AND- SO WE REALLY SEE-THAT AS DRIVING BUSINESS OUT OF THE STATE- PORTS THAT OUR OUR- BUSINESS THAT COULD COME TO STOCKTON WOULD SEE YOU KNOW PROBABLY THE- PACIFIC NORTHWEST OR- FOR. POTENTIALLY CAN'T TO. I'M I GREW UP IN ASSEMBLY MEMBER RAYOS DISTRICT AND USED TO RIDE MY BIKE ALL DAY FOR THE NEIGHBORHOOD. NUMBER TO DENY ONE WOULD COME HOME RIGHT WITH LUNGS IN. AND SO I CAN FULLY APPRECIATE AND SUPPORT EVERYTHING THAT WE'RE DOING TO REDUCE- EMISSIONS AND- TO IMPACT THESE COMMUNITIES. OCT AND- IN COLLABORATION WITH PORT ALONG AND THE OF WE SOME. A XANDER OF GRANT THIS PAST YEAR. AND WE ARE IN THE PROCESS OF IMPLEMENTING. AND UTILIZING THIRTY FIVE ZERO MISSION CARGO HANDLING- PIECES OF EQUIPMENT- ALONG THE PORT. AND WHILE THIS IS BEEN SUCCESSFUL AND WE REALLY LOOK FORWARD TO IMPLEMENTING- AND UTILIZING THIS EQUIPMENT. IT WOULD NOT OF BEEN DOABLE IF WE HADN'T PARTNERED WITH. LOW OAKLAND AND LONG BEACH A LOT OF THE GRANT FUNDING REQUIREMENTS FOR FIFTY FIFTY MATCH FOR THE LOCAL- STAKEHOLDERS. AND BECAUSE THE- SWISS. IS THE LEAD I THINK. OUR MATCH TO TWENTY. WHICH WAS ENOUGH TO GET OUR BOARD TO BUY IN IN INVEST AND FINALLY JUMP INTO THE ZERO MISSION- GOALS. AND SO WE'RE IN THE MIDDLE THAT THAT'S IT'S SUCCESSFUL WE'VE JUST STARTED RECEIVING OUR EQUIPMENT VERY- EXCITED ABOUT IT WE'RE GONNA BRING SOME OF IT UP I THINK. LATER IN MARCH TO DO A SHOWCASE UP HERE CAP WELL- BUT- MAYBE THE POTENTIAL FOR THE STATE TO LOOK AT REDUCING SOME OF THOSE. THIS CALL SHARES MAULER MEET SIZE POOR WOULD BE A LOT MORE OR A- OF. FOR PORTS LIKE STOPPED IN A OTHERS TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE OPPORTUNITY. CLEARLY LAW MY NOTES SO. I WOULD JUST THE THANK FOR THE OPPORTUNITY I'M TO BE. WE HOPEFULLY YOU'LL SEE MORE OF A AT THE TIME IN READY TO GO SEE YOU YOU CAN COME SEE US INTO AND SO THANK YOU AND IF THERE'S ANY QUESTIONS AJ I JUST HAVE A COUPLE OKAY AND THAT THE YOU COVER A LOT THERE- THEIR THEIR THEIR- POWER THE PLUG IN WITH. THAT BUT BUT THEN IT I'LL TURN TECHNOLOGIES ON IT THE BONNET WHICH IS IN A BONTA ANYMORE RIGHT BUT IT THAT'S WHAT THE PEOPLE KNOW IT AS RIGHT THE SOCK WHATEVER THE LABEL TALK SO IS THAT IS THAT CARP APPROVED. IT'S NOT A PER CARB APPROVED I THOUGHT IT WAS. IT'S NOT VERIFIED BUT SO CAN YOU CAN BE USED AT BIRTH AND IS IT MEET ANY REGULATE ANY REQUIREMENTS STILL IT'S STILL A PILOT PHASE. CARP HAS SERVE HAS CERTIFIED OF THESE ONE OF THE ENTITIES THAT I'M AWARE OF OKAY- IN I THINK BUT THE ACTUAL. READING THIS OF THAT PARTICULAR ENTITY IN TERMS OF COMING MARKET TO ME DO YOU LIVE ON THE MARKET MARKET AVAILABILITY. THAT'S THAT'S STILL CHALLENGE. BECAUSE I THINK A BIG DEAL HERE IS THAT THE IT'S YOUR WAY YOU'RE FACING IN YOUR DAYS IN YOU IN YOUR PORT IS THE INFREQUENT CALLERS. AS A MEMBERSHIP A COMMUNIST AND THREE MILLION BUCKS OR WHATEVER IT'S GONNA COST ME TO CONVERT OVER TO PUT SHORE POWER WHEN I'M IN CALIFORNIA I GO IN THERE ONCE- GET THE VERIFY. A HAS BEEN THE IN WATER SYSTEM AND THAT'S WHAT ALLEN ON BEACH TO USE BECAUSE THEIR BIG PORTS BUT STOCKTON AND WHEN YOU MEET DON'T HAVE THE IN THE- TURNING BEACON IN THE SIZE AND THE WAY IT FOR THEY IN THE WATER SYSTEM SO. TO GO TO WHAT'S CALLED AN EIGHT AND WENT AND TECHNOLOGY IS A COULD YOU USED. WHETHER YOU'RE OVER THE THAT WHAT'S. OUR AND ISN'T VERIFY. IT AND THE WORKING THROUGH AND WE'RE TALKING TO A COP. IT'S WILL TO TEST. OUT WHEN EMAIL. AND THEN WE WENT TO LOOK FOR DEAR MY- FOR A- THAT TECHNOLOGY DEAR SAYS. CAN'T BE IT'S NOT. SO THERE THERE ARE SYSTEMS OUT THERE IN DEVELOPMENT THE ONE HE'S REFERENCES AND KRAMER ACTUALLY READY BUT THERE'S ALSO. THAT'S JUST NOT A- RETURN FOR THE SMALLER PORT. EITHER SO IT'S- IT'S STILL VERY IMAGE. AND GROWING INDUSTRY AND PRIVATE TALK ABOUT IT YOU KNOW DELAYS AND REGULATIONS THAT WE HAVE TIME TO CATCH UP WITH WITH. YOU KNOW THE R. AND D. AND ALL THAT. SO WITH REGARD TO THE ROWERS THE ROLL OFFS. WITH THAT POTENTIALLY BE A TECHNOLOGY THAT COULD BE THIS WITH THEM. THAT WOULDN'T MOST LIKELY HAVE TO. ACKNOWLEDGE IT BECAUSE FOR ONE IT IS MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO RETROFIT ROW RUSH GETS FOR PER SIDE. OUR THESE. AN HAS OF THE SIZE OF THE PLEA. IS TO NOW. A CALL. EFFECTIVE SO YOU HAVE TO. THAT OKAY. YES THERE. AND THEN. QUESTION I THINK. BUT I KNOW LOTS OF OIL ON ELECTRICITY MIGHT NOT BE A GOOD IDEA. AND I KNOW THAT THERE WAS- IT. THERE'S BEEN SOME COMMUNICATION AROUND HERE ABOUT POTENTIALLY MAYBE THE AG MAYBE SOMEBODY TO DO IT NEEDS TO DO A FEASIBILITY. STUDY BEFORE CARP JUST ESTABLISHES A REGULATION I THINK THERE'S AN INDUSTRY MEMBER HERE WHO WANTED TO SPEAK TO THAT. I DON'T KNOW IF MARGO'S HERE NOT. I DON'T SEE THEM BUT- THERE SHE HAS DID YOU DID YOU WISH TO PUT THE LID ON. ON THAT TOPIC OF IT. JUST IDENTIFY YOURSELF ANSWER YET THANK YOU SO MUCH MARGO PARKS AND A HALF OF WITH BY- WESTERN STATES PETROLEUM ASSOCIATION AT YOUR QUESTION AND- MISTER DONNELLY BELIEVE THAT. YOU KNOW WHERE WE ARE IN TERMS OF THE FEASIBILITY ANALYSIS ON THIS TYPE OF TECHNOLOGY IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT- AS WAS DISCUSSED THERE'S- THERE ARE SOME TECHNOLOGIES THAT ARE IN. PILOT STAGES THAT HAVE ALREADY ADOPTED BUT THAT IS ON THE- ON THE CARGO SIDE AS I UNDERSTAND IT NOT ON THE TANKER SIDE. AS YOU POINTED OUT THERE ARE CHALLENGES- WITH PLUGGING IN A TANKER- INTO A INTO A TERMINAL. THERE'S ALSO WHICH IS WITH THE AND THE SOCCER THE SENATE SYSTEM THAT HAVE YET BEEN WORKED OUT IT'S PREMATURE ACTION IS POINT EVEN TO DO THE TYPE OF. YOUR I'D- HE UM LIKE PILOT DEVON JUST BE WE HAVEN'T EVEN DONE THE RISK ASSESSMENT I'M ON THAT TECHNOLOGY AS THE LAST THING I THINK THAT ANYONE WANTS IS TO HAVE A PILOT PROJECT OR OR MUCH LESS A SHIP COME AND PUT A SOCK ON THEIR OVER THE BOILER AND HAVE AN EXPLOSION OF IT IN A PART SEVERAL NIGHTMARE. THERE ARE MANY STE IT HAPPEN. TECH CAN BE USED ARE A LOT OF INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS THAT DO THIS TYPE OF REGULATION SETTING- AND TESTING SO WE ENCOURAGE ON A ARE BEING WE'VE SPOKEN WITH THEM AT LENGTH AND I KNOW WITH THE PORTS OF YOU KNOW GETTING THE RIGHT STATE. OUT THE TO ASSESS HOW WE MOVE FORWARD WITH ASSESSING THIS TECHNOLOGY IS A- POINT. EVEN AS A- AS YOU WISH. TO STUDY THE FEASIBILITY. BEFORE A REGULATIONS ESTABLISH IS THAT CORRECT ABSOLUTELY I THINK OUR PRIMARY CONCERN HERE SAFETY- AND YOU KNOW AS THE PORTS POINTED OUT I THINK THAT THERE ARE A LOT OF WAYS IN WHICH WE CAN MEET THE GOALS A RB HAS. AND WERE- WERE VERY EAGER TO WORK WITH AIR BE ON THAT AND YOU KNOW AT THIS POINT USING THOSE TECHNOLOGIES MAY NOT BE THE BEST. BEST PATH FORWARD BUT PERHAPS THERE ARE ALTERNATIVES. TO GETTING THESE EMISSIONS REDUCTION BEYOND WHAT THE PARTS OF ALREADY DONE WITH THIS TREMENDOUS. X. BUT THANK YOU OUR SPEAKERS TO YOU WISH TO ADD ANYTHING THE I JUST WANT TO ADD ONE MORE. IN EMPHASIZE RESEARCHER IN SOMETHING YOU SAID THAT I THINK IS VERY RELEVANT TO THIS DISCUSSION. WHICH IS WE NEED TO INNOVATE NOT REGULATE. AND WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT THE PORTS OF CALIFORNIA. WE HAVE BEEN INNOVATORS AGAIN THERE'S NO INDUSTRYTHAT HAS A RESUME THAT WE DO. IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA REPORTS OF BILLION A PORTS ALONG BEACH WITHIN A DECADE REDUCED EMISSIONS HARMFUL EMISSIONS FROM TRUCKS BY 90% NO ONE ELSE IN THIS COUNTRY HAS THAT RESUME SO WE FEEL VERY COMFORTABLE ENOUGH TO MISTER THAT WE COULD GO TO ZERO EMISSION BY THE GOAL YOUR THAT WE'VE INDICATED. SO I THINK ALL THE US IS THAT YOU CONTINUE TO ALLOW US TO INNOVATE AND MOVE FORWARD IN A PRACTICAL MATTER BECAUSE- IF THAT DOESN'T HAPPEN. I THINK THE PRIOR SPEAKERS OF ALREADY ADDRESSED THE DIRE SITUATION WE ARE IN MARKET SHARE COMPETITIVENESS AND CALIFORNIA'S NOT THE FIFTH. LARGEST ECONOMY. FOR NO REASON. ONE OF THE BIG REASONS IS BECAUSE WE'VE HAD A GREAT PORT ACTIVE COMPLEX HERE. THAT'S INTERNATIONAL TRADE SO THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR SUPPORT MISTER CHAIRMAN WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE COMMITTEE ON THIS ISSUE AS WE GO FORWARD THANK YOU THANK YOU TO THIS PANEL THINKING ALL SPEAKERS TO IRAN FOR PARTICIPATING. CONVERSATION IT'S NOT OVER FOR SURE I APPRECIATE EVERYONE'S A PARTICIPATION TODAY AND THEIR ENGAGEMENT AS WE GO FORWARD THANK YOU. I HAVE TO DO PUBLIC COMMENT. OKAY SO IF THERE ARE ANY V. I.

IN HERE WE ARE LOOKING FOR REGULATORY% COHERENCE WE WANT TO GET TO THE SAME PLACE BUT WE NEED HELP GETTING THERE SO WE DON'T HAVE A COLLISION OF STATE LINE STATE REGULATION LIKE SEQUEL AND OTHER THINGS.
