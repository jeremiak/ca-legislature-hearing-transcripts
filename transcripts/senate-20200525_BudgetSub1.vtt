SOME DISTRICTS ARE MOVING

00:22:57.676 --> 00:23:03.515
FORWARD- THROUGH MOSTLY. THIS

00:23:03.582 --> 00:23:05.250
FUNDING SOURCES IT'S GOES TO BE

00:47:03.153 --> 00:47:04.421

CLOSURES. AND JUST PROVIDE SOME

00:47:18.335 --> 00:47:20.904
BRIEF CONTEXT- WHEN- THE

00:47:20.971 --> 00:47:22.406
EMERGENCY EXECUTIVE ORDER WAS.

00:47:22.472 --> 00:47:26.677
WAS ISSUED IN IN MID MARCH- THE

00:47:26.743 --> 00:47:28.045
LEGISLATURE SUBSEQUENTLY PASSED

00:47:28.111 --> 00:47:30.847
SB ONE SEVENTEEN. WHICH ARE.

00:47:30.914 --> 00:47:31.748
TRYING TO PROVIDE SOME OF THE

00:47:31.815 --> 00:47:34.251
SCHOOL OF STABILITY FISCAL OUR-

00:47:34.318 --> 00:47:35.652
PREDICTABILITY FOR DISTRICTS IN

00:47:35.719 --> 00:47:37.054
AND THEN. A COUPLE OF THINGS

00:47:37.120 --> 00:47:38.722
ONE IT SAID THAT. IF SCHOOL

00:47:38.789 --> 00:47:40.557
DISTRICTS DO NOT OFFER A FULL

00:47:40.624 --> 00:47:41.692
HUNDRED NEEDY SCHOOL YEAR. THEY

00:47:41.758 --> 00:47:43.193
WILL NOT FACE FISCAL PENALTIES

00:47:43.260 --> 00:47:44.494
WHICH ARE CURRENTLY IN LAW. IF

00:47:44.561 --> 00:47:45.529
YOU DON'T HAVE A HUNDRED IT'S

00:47:45.596 --> 00:47:47.397
CLEAR TYPICALLY WE HAVE YOU'RE-

00:47:47.464 --> 00:47:47.998
YOU'RE ALL SET. I MEAN GETS

00:47:48.065 --> 00:47:49.700
REDUCED. THE SECOND THING IT

00:47:49.766 --> 00:47:52.502
DIDN'T. IS IT STOPPED. TURNING

00:47:52.569 --> 00:47:53.503
EIGHTY EIGHT OR TEN MINUTES-

00:47:53.570 --> 00:47:55.272
AFTER FEBRUARY TWENTY NINE. AND

00:47:55.339 --> 00:47:56.807
I. THINK AGAIN THE IDEA WAS. SO

00:47:56.873 --> 00:47:58.141
THAT SCHOOLS WOULD NOT BE HURT

00:47:58.208 --> 00:47:59.910
BY THE FACT THAT. MANY STUDENTS

00:47:59.977 --> 00:48:01.044
WERE COMING ACROSS SO THAT THE

00:48:01.111 --> 00:48:03.647
RECORD YOUR DRINK- SERVE AS- AS

00:48:03.714 --> 00:48:05.716
THE- CULMINATING OUTBREAK. AND

00:48:05.782 --> 00:48:07.417
SPREAD THROUGHOUT THE STATE. SO

00:48:07.484 --> 00:48:09.720
THAT. THESE ARE THESE ARE

00:48:09.786 --> 00:48:15.959
MEASURES THAT WERE. INCLUDED

00:48:16.026 --> 00:48:16.793
FOR THE- OF THE FISCAL YEAR BUT

00:48:16.860 --> 00:48:18.462
THEY DO. CONTINUE INTO THE YEAR

00:48:18.528 --> 00:48:19.062
TWENTY FOUR ONE AND SO WANT TO

00:48:19.129 --> 00:48:20.597
PUT QUESTION TO. WHAT WHAT IF

00:48:20.664 --> 00:48:21.164
ANY KIND OF MEASURES THIS DO

00:48:21.231 --> 00:48:22.165
YOU TO INCLUDE IN YOUR TWENTIES.

00:48:22.232 --> 00:48:24.401
ONE BUDGET CONSIDERING THAT

00:48:24.468 --> 00:48:26.536
THERE ARE NO RIGHT NOW WE DON'T

00:48:26.603 --> 00:48:27.571
HAVE A LOT OF CLARITY ABOUT

00:48:27.638 --> 00:48:28.905
EXACTLY WHAT WE OPNING WILL

00:48:28.972 --> 00:48:30.240
LOOK LIKE. WE DON'T KNOW IF

00:48:30.307 --> 00:48:32.409
THAT IF SCHOOL OPEN AS THEY-

00:48:32.476 --> 00:48:33.844
ARE INTENDED BEFORE AND WE

00:48:33.910 --> 00:48:34.778
DON'T KNOW IF THERE MIGHT BE A

00:48:34.845 --> 00:48:36.013
POSSIBILITY OF. ADDITIONAL

00:48:36.079 --> 00:48:38.248
SCHOOL CLOSURES AS- ADDITIONAL

00:48:38.315 --> 00:48:40.417
OUTBREAKS FLARE UP. OVER THE

00:48:40.484 --> 00:48:42.819
NEXT COMING YEAR- SO THAT THERE

00:48:42.886 --> 00:48:43.720
ARE A NUMBER OF WAYS TO ADDRESS

00:48:43.787 --> 00:48:44.855
THOSE ISSUES BUT IT IS AN

00:48:44.921 --> 00:48:46.690
IMPORTANT QUESTION FOR- SENDING

00:48:46.757 --> 00:48:48.592
SIGNALS TO. THE FUEL ABOUT. HOW

00:48:48.659 --> 00:48:50.360
IT WILL BE FUNDED. I THINK IT'S

00:48:50.427 --> 00:48:51.762
ALSO IMPORTANT ISSUE NOT JUST

00:48:51.828 --> 00:48:52.896
BECAUSE OF THE FISCAL STABILITY

00:48:52.963 --> 00:48:54.164
BUT ALSO BECAUSE IT FROM FROM.

00:48:54.231 --> 00:48:55.599
YOU HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY HERE

00:48:55.666 --> 00:48:56.366
TO SOMETHING QUITE A MESSAGE

00:48:56.433 --> 00:48:57.534
JUST SCHOOL DISTRICT ABOUT WHAT

00:48:57.601 --> 00:48:59.069
YOU EXPECT THEM TO DO. DURING

00:48:59.136 --> 00:49:00.270
THESE CLOSURES AND WHAT KINDS

00:49:00.337 --> 00:49:02.205
OF. DISTANCE LEARNING SHOULD

00:49:02.272 --> 00:49:04.908
BE. PUT IN PLACE. IF THE IF

00:49:04.975 --> 00:49:06.943
ADDITIONAL CALLS WERE TO OCCUR.

00:49:07.010 --> 00:49:08.211
ONE OF THE CHALLENGES WHEN THIS

00:49:08.278 --> 00:49:09.012
OCCURRED IS THAT EVERYTHING

00:49:09.079 --> 00:49:10.847
HAPPENED VERY QUICKLY IN MARCH

00:49:10.914 --> 00:49:12.015
THAT THE ROAD RIGHT THERE'S A

00:49:12.082 --> 00:49:13.150
LOT OF GUIDANCE PROVIDED BY THE

00:49:13.216 --> 00:49:14.318
DEPARTMENT ADDED THERE WAS

00:49:14.384 --> 00:49:15.686
THAT. EXACTLY WERE SPECIFIED

00:49:15.752 --> 00:49:18.555
THAT. ARE YOU KNOW- ELLIE'S

00:49:18.622 --> 00:49:19.222
WORK TO THE BEST OF THEIR

00:49:19.289 --> 00:49:21.058
ABILITY TO CONTINUE TO PROVIDE.

00:49:21.124 --> 00:49:22.292
HIGH QUALITY INSTRUCTION

00:49:22.359 --> 00:49:23.193
THROUGH A DISTANCE LEARNING

00:49:23.260 --> 00:49:24.928
FORMAT. BUT THIRD BUT BEYOND

00:49:24.995 --> 00:49:26.563
THOSE KIND OF STATEMENTS THERE

00:49:26.630 --> 00:49:27.898
WAS NOT A LOT OF CONCRETE.

00:49:27.964 --> 00:49:29.232
REQUIREMENTS OR EXPECTATIONS

00:49:29.299 --> 00:49:31.468
AND SO THAT'S SOMETHING THAT-

00:49:31.535 --> 00:49:32.869
AS PART OF THE BUDGET PROCESS

00:49:32.936 --> 00:49:33.837
YOU HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO

00:49:33.904 --> 00:49:35.038
WEIGH IN A LITTLE BIT MORE

00:49:35.105 --> 00:49:36.740
ABOUT THAT. WHAT YOU THINK. FOR

00:49:36.807 --> 00:49:43.747
EXAMPLE NO NEXT QUESTION.

00:49:43.814 --> 00:49:44.348
SHOULD BE FOR SCHOOLS. THANK

00:49:44.414 --> 00:49:45.582
YOU SIR. FINANCE GIVEN THE SICK

00:49:45.649 --> 00:49:46.483
OF THE BUT ISSUE WERE ACTUALLY

00:49:46.550 --> 00:49:47.351
A BE INTERESTED IN YOUR

00:49:47.417 --> 00:49:50.020
COMMENTS. CERTAINLY THANK YOU

VERY MUCH- GENERAL OFFICE SO I

00:49:52.789 --> 00:49:53.557
JUST CALLED DEPARTMENT OF

00:49:53.623 --> 00:49:55.859
FINANCE WE DON'T HAVE A FORMAL

00:49:55.926 --> 00:49:57.561
POSITION ON THIS PROPOSAL AND

00:49:57.627 --> 00:49:59.062
AT THIS TIME HOWEVER WE DO HAVE

00:49:59.129 --> 00:50:00.931
SOME CONCERNS WITH THE IDEA OF.

00:50:00.997 --> 00:50:02.499
HOLDING HARMLESS EIGHTY A. M.

00:50:02.566 --> 00:50:04.067
IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE SO THE

00:50:04.134 --> 00:50:04.801
FIRST THING THAT I WOULD NOTE

00:50:04.868 --> 00:50:07.537
IS- MOST SCHOOL DISTRICTS ARE

00:50:07.604 --> 00:50:09.339
GOING TO RECEIVE A VERY SIMILAR

00:50:09.406 --> 00:50:10.540
AMOUNT OF FUNDING PLUS THE

00:50:10.607 --> 00:50:12.275
PRODUCTIONS AND I'LL SEE ABOUT-

00:50:12.342 --> 00:50:13.677
AS THEY DID LAST YEAR BECAUSE

00:50:13.744 --> 00:50:14.978
WE DO HAVE A HOLD HARMLESS

00:50:15.045 --> 00:50:16.146
ALREADY BUILT INTO I'LL SEE

00:50:16.213 --> 00:50:17.214
ABOUT THAT ALLOWS THEM TO

00:50:17.280 --> 00:50:19.349
RECEIVE- THE SAME EIGHTY EIGHT.

00:50:19.416 --> 00:50:20.784
IN THE PRIOR YEAR AND BECAUSE

00:50:20.851 --> 00:50:22.352
WE DIDN'T HOLD HARMLESS

00:50:22.419 --> 00:50:24.588
NINETEEN TWENTY- THAT WOULD NOT

00:50:24.654 --> 00:50:27.657
NECESSARILY REFLECT ON COULD%

00:50:27.724 --> 00:50:30.160
NINETEEN AT CHANGES IN DNA. I'M

00:50:30.227 --> 00:50:32.362
SO THAT'S ALREADY BUILT IN- AND

00:50:32.429 --> 00:50:33.263
I THINK TO THE EXTENT YOU KNOW

00:50:33.330 --> 00:50:35.198
THERE'S A CONCERN ABOUT HOLDING

00:50:35.265 --> 00:50:37.200
PEOPLE HOMELESS IN TWENTY ONE

00:50:37.267 --> 00:50:37.801
TWENTY TWO I THINK THAT THAT'S

00:50:37.868 --> 00:50:39.669
DEFINITELY. A CONVERSATION WE

00:50:39.736 --> 00:50:43.206
CAN HAVE- IN TERMS OF- OTHER

00:50:43.273 --> 00:50:44.975
CONCERNS THAT WE HAVE WITH

00:50:45.041 --> 00:50:47.344
WITHHOLDING HARMLESS IN TWENTY

00:50:47.411 --> 00:50:49.546
TWENTY ONE. AND WE'VE HAD SOME

00:50:49.613 --> 00:50:51.848
UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES OF

00:50:51.915 --> 00:50:53.250
HOLDING HER LIST IN NINETEEN

00:50:53.316 --> 00:50:54.651
TWENTY AND AGAIN YOU KNOW WE

00:50:54.718 --> 00:50:56.386
MADE THAT DECISION AND- THE

00:50:56.453 --> 00:50:57.788
ADMINISTRATION AND THE

00:50:57.854 --> 00:50:59.623
LEGISLATURE. IN A TIME OF IT

00:50:59.689 --> 00:51:00.824
EVEN MORE CERTAIN THAN WE HAVE

00:51:00.891 --> 00:51:02.659
NOW- IN TERMS OF WHAT'S

00:51:02.726 --> 00:51:04.161
HAPPENING IN COOK AT NINETEEN

00:51:04.227 --> 00:51:05.128
AND I THINK AT THE TIME IT WAS

00:51:05.195 --> 00:51:06.696
CERTAINLY AND I THINK IT

00:51:06.763 --> 00:51:08.565
REMAINS THE CORRECT THING TO DO

00:51:08.632 --> 00:51:09.733
BUT WE ARE HAVING SOME

00:51:09.800 --> 00:51:10.600
UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES OF

00:51:10.667 --> 00:51:13.336
THAT- INCLUDING THINGS LIKE WE

00:51:13.403 --> 00:51:15.605
HAVE. AN OUTSTANDING ISSUE THAT

00:51:15.672 --> 00:51:16.273
WE NEED TO ADDRESS WITH THE

00:51:16.339 --> 00:51:19.876
DEPARTMENT OF ED ON ESPECIALLY

00:51:19.943 --> 00:51:23.246
XFINITY ON THE EIGHTH INNING. I

00:51:23.313 --> 00:51:26.283
WE HAVE SOME LEDS THAT DID HAVE

00:51:26.349 --> 00:51:28.652
INCREASED YEAH THE BRIDGE WE

00:51:28.718 --> 00:51:32.556
KNOW CUT OFF TO. ON AND HAD

00:51:32.622 --> 00:51:35.358
KNOW K. OF YOU KNOW. AM I TO

00:51:35.425 --> 00:51:37.360
WRITE TWENTY THE STADIUM AND

00:51:37.427 --> 00:51:39.396
THEN YOU KNOW WE TO SORT OF

00:51:39.463 --> 00:51:41.531
DOUBLE COUNTING. AND DOUBLE PAY

00:51:41.598 --> 00:51:51.541
FOR I'LL SEE IF THAT. WAS NOT

00:51:51.608 --> 00:51:53.310
LONGER AND LONGER. I NEED TO

00:51:53.376 --> 00:51:54.778
CREATE A CLICK A FACT WHEN YOU

00:51:54.845 --> 00:51:56.112
WERE FIRST BACK TO AN EDA

00:51:56.179 --> 00:51:58.648
FUNDING FORMULA- THAT COULDN'T

00:51:58.715 --> 00:52:00.550

THEY REVERT TO. A NORMAL EDA

SO- THESE ARE JUST SOME THINGS

00:52:08.825 --> 00:52:10.627
TO KEEP IN MIND- AGAIN I THINK.

00:52:10.694 --> 00:52:12.429

POPULATION TO TRY TO. TAKE CARE

01:03:07.984 --> 01:03:09.385
OF RATHER THAN HAVE AN

01:03:09.452 --> 01:03:11.387
AUTOMATIC REDUCTION TO TRY TO

01:03:17.260 --> 01:03:19.962
LET'S MOVE TO THE LA NEXT.

01:03:20.029 --> 01:03:21.397
DISTRO JUST A COUPLE COMING

01:03:21.464 --> 01:03:23.132
THAT WE HAD A FEW SUGGESTIONS

01:03:23.199 --> 01:03:25.701
REGARDING ALTERNATIVES TO- TO

01:03:25.768 --> 01:03:28.171

WAYS TO TAKE THE REDUCTIONS

01:03:29.605 --> 01:03:30.873
SPECIFICALLY ON THE REGIONAL

01:03:30.940 --> 01:03:33.109
MARKET RATE REDUCTION- WE WOULD

01:03:33.176 --> 01:03:34.310
RECOMMEND RATHER THAN ACROSS

01:03:34.377 --> 01:03:35.311
THE BOARD REDUCTION THAT THERE

01:03:35.378 --> 01:03:36.646
BE A REDUCTION THAT'S BASED ON

01:03:36.712 --> 01:03:37.713
THE REGIONAL MARKET RATE

01:03:37.780 --> 01:03:40.082

01:03:42.818 --> 01:03:44.053
QUESTION OF THE MARKET IN THEIR

01:03:44.120 --> 01:03:46.189
AREAS ACROSS THE STATE. THE WAY

01:03:46.255 --> 01:03:46.789
THAT IT SHOULD MATTER NOW WE

01:03:46.856 --> 01:03:50.626
HAVE CONCERNS THAT IT MIGHT BUT

01:03:50.693 --> 01:03:51.260
NOW THAT MIGHT NOT BE THE CASE.

01:03:51.327 --> 01:03:52.328
WE ALSO NOTED A COUPLE OF OTHER

01:03:52.395 --> 01:03:53.396
PLACES IN THE CITY WAS

01:03:53.462 --> 01:03:55.264
INTERESTED IN. MAKING

01:04:00.536 --> 01:04:02.905
COUPLE OF AREAS CONSIDER. ONE

01:04:02.972 --> 01:04:04.407
REBOUND BUT THE LEGISLATURE

01:04:04.473 --> 01:04:05.875
COULD CONSIDER REDUCTIONS

01:04:05.942 --> 01:04:07.944
AGAIN. ADMINISTRATORS ARE

01:04:08.010 --> 01:04:10.479
ACTIVITIES ARE. ALSO ESTIMATE

01:04:10.546 --> 01:04:13.382

01:04:15.051 --> 01:04:15.751
SYSTEM THAT'S FUNDED THROUGH

01:04:15.818 --> 01:04:18.087
COMPANY AID- THE OTHER DAY WE

01:04:18.154 --> 01:04:19.622
WERE NO IS. THERE IS FIFTY

01:04:19.689 --> 01:04:22.158
MILLION DOLLARS IN. SIXTY FOUR

01:04:22.225 --> 01:04:23.726
PENDING THAT IS SCHEDULED TO.

01:04:23.793 --> 01:04:26.295
IT HAS. TO BE BEGINNING IN

01:04:26.362 --> 01:04:27.163
TWENTY TWENTY ONE TO BE USED

01:04:27.230 --> 01:04:27.897
FOR ADDITIONAL GENERAL

01:04:27.964 --> 01:04:29.632
CHOCOLATE SAUCE. WELL THERE'S A

01:04:29.699 --> 01:04:30.933
LOT THAT HAD NOT BEEN ALLOCATED

01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:32.101
YET NOBODY HAS BEEN AWARDED

01:04:32.168 --> 01:04:34.203
THOSE FUNDS. AND SO ONE OPTION

01:04:34.270 --> 01:04:36.105
WOULD BE TO REDIRECT HAPPENING

01:04:36.172 --> 01:04:37.740
RATHER THAN GOING OUT TWO SPOTS

01:04:37.807 --> 01:04:43.279
TO BE USED. TO MINIMIZE THE

01:04:43.346 --> 01:04:43.879
RATE REDUCTIONS THAT ARE. I'M

01:04:43.946 --> 01:04:45.047
OLDER SPECIFIC COMMON ABOUT I

01:04:45.114 --> 01:04:46.649
WOULD. TO DIE TALKING ABOUT THE

01:04:46.716 --> 01:04:49.518
STOPPER. WHICH IS. MORE BODIES

01:04:49.585 --> 01:04:50.486
OUT NOT ABOUT THE BIGGER

01:04:50.553 --> 01:04:52.255
PROPOSALS BUT ABOUT THE CHOKER

01:04:52.321 --> 01:04:53.522
OUR GROWTH ADJUSTMENT WHICH IS

01:04:53.589 --> 01:04:55.358
SOMETHING THAT'S IN STATUTE. SO

01:04:55.424 --> 01:04:57.793
UNDER CURRENT LAW- THUS THE

01:04:57.860 --> 01:04:58.995
PRESCHOOL PROGRAM THE ALTERNATE

01:04:59.061 --> 01:05:00.730
PAYMENT PROGRAM JOHN TUCKER

01:05:00.796 --> 01:05:03.399
THEY ARE. ADJUSTED EVERY YEAR

01:05:03.466 --> 01:05:05.434
BASED ON. DEMOGRAPHIC

01:05:05.501 --> 01:05:07.203
INFORMATION ON THE YOU'RE

01:05:07.270 --> 01:05:08.771
YOU'RE CHANGING THE ZERO FOUR

01:05:08.838 --> 01:05:11.173
POPULATION- RECENTLY BECAUSE

01:05:11.240 --> 01:05:12.308
THOSE ARE THE FOCUS HAS BEEN

01:05:12.375 --> 01:05:13.776
DECLINING THAT HAS BEEN A

01:05:13.843 --> 01:05:15.911
NEGATIVE ADJUSTMENT- AND IN

01:05:15.978 --> 01:05:18.981
THIS- IN THIS BUDGET THERE IS A

01:05:19.048 --> 01:05:20.483
REDUCTION OF ABOUT SIXTY FOUR

01:05:20.549 --> 01:05:21.217
MILLION DOLLARS WHEN YOU ADD

01:05:21.284 --> 01:05:22.752
EVERYTHING UP. AND THERE'S A

01:05:22.818 --> 01:05:24.553
TWO POINT 55% REDUCTION IN THE

01:05:24.620 --> 01:05:26.055
SORT OF CORPORATION PROJECTED

01:05:26.122 --> 01:05:27.923
SO THAT'S WHERE IT COMES FROM.

01:05:27.990 --> 01:05:28.991
THE STAFF RECOMMENDATION HERE

01:05:29.058 --> 01:05:30.660
WOULD BE TO REJECT THAT

01:05:30.726 --> 01:05:33.863
ADJUSTMENT- IT SO TO. NOT MAKE

01:05:33.929 --> 01:05:35.064
THE REDUCTION AND THEN TO

01:05:35.131 --> 01:05:36.565
CHANGE TRAINABLE CHANGE

01:05:36.632 --> 01:05:38.701
LANGUAGE SO THAT- IN YEARS WHEN

01:05:38.768 --> 01:05:40.503
THERE IS A NEGATIVE- A

01:05:40.569 --> 01:05:42.104
REDUCTION IN POPULATION ARE

01:05:42.171 --> 01:05:48.210
OBSERVABLE. PUBLISHING BUT

01:05:48.277 --> 01:05:49.145
THERE'S NO JUST. IT WILL

01:05:49.211 --> 01:05:49.812
PROBABLY GO TO THE OF EDUCATION

THE REGIONAL MARKET RATE FOR

01:05:55.251 --> 01:05:57.086
USE OF THE- FAR MORE IN THE

01:05:57.153 --> 01:05:58.721
REDUCTIONS IN THE LAND OF

01:05:58.788 --> 01:06:00.656
FIFTY- THAT HE WAS FIFTY

01:06:00.723 --> 01:06:02.425
MILLION DOLLARS FOR EXAMPLE

01:06:02.491 --> 01:06:05.728
THAT WAS REFERENCED. CERTAINLY

01:06:05.795 --> 01:06:06.696
JUST GO HOME DEPARTMENT OF

01:06:06.762 --> 01:06:09.365

ENSURE THAT. THE PRODUCTION

01:06:14.704 --> 01:06:16.172
TAKE INTO THE ARM R. MAKES THE

01:06:16.238 --> 01:06:17.673
MOST SENSE IS DONE AS QUICKLY

01:06:17.740 --> 01:06:19.942
AS POSSIBLE. AFTER ACTIVELY

01:06:20.009 --> 01:06:22.845

STILL PRODUCING. AT ACHIEVING

01:06:26.148 --> 01:06:26.916
THE SAME AMOUNT OF SAVINGS BUT

01:06:26.982 --> 01:06:28.684
THAT'S BEING DONE- AS EQUITABLY

01:06:28.751 --> 01:06:30.086
AS POSSIBLE SO THAT THAT'S

01:06:30.152 --> 01:06:31.520
SOMETHING THAT WE ARE VERY MUCH

01:06:31.587 --> 01:06:32.888
OPEN TO AND WORKING ON RIGHT

NOW SH REGARDING THE FUNDING I

01:06:35.458 --> 01:06:36.559
BELIEVE THE THIRTY NINE YOU

CHILD CARE RATES AND BACK FILL

01:06:43.566 --> 01:06:45.735
WOULD BE- AN ALLOWABLE USE OF

SITUATIONS WHERE- THEY MIGHT.

01:07:09.592 --> 01:07:12.294
BEGIN AND DRUG ABUSE- WE THINK

01:07:12.361 --> 01:07:14.029
THAT THAT IS ALLOWABLE IT GETS

01:07:14.096 --> 01:07:16.065
A LITTLE BIT GRAYER WHEN WE'RE

01:07:16.132 --> 01:07:18.834
LOOKING AT- GREAT AXLES FOR

A TECHNICAL ADJUSTMENTS THAT WE

01:07:35.985 --> 01:07:37.253
MAKE IT THE STATUTORY

01:07:37.319 --> 01:07:39.088
ADJUSTMENT THAT WE MAKE- AND AS

01:07:39.155 --> 01:07:41.190
MR CABRAL NOTED IT HAS BEEN.

01:07:41.257 --> 01:07:43.092
MORE NEGATIVE IN RECENT YEARS

01:07:43.159 --> 01:07:44.126

ON THAT AT THIS POINT HOW WE

01:07:51.133 --> 01:07:52.468
WOULD THAT THAT WOULD CREATE A

01:07:52.535 --> 01:07:54.236
REDUCTION IN THE AMOUNT OF PROP

01:09:13.382 --> 01:09:14.049

CHILDCARE TO WORKING FAMILIES

01:09:15.951 --> 01:09:17.753

THE STATE FINDS ITSELF AND WE

01:09:29.598 --> 01:09:31.267
ARE CONCERNED THAT THE PROPOSED

STATE'S CHILD CARE SYSTEM

01:09:43.712 --> 01:09:45.481
SURVIVES THIS CRISIS. OUR

INABILITY TO SECURE BOTH SPACE

COSTING MORE FAR PROGRAM STOP

01:10:26.889 --> 01:10:32.995
THAT IT WILL COST THEM ABOUT.

THEY GAVE US THE COST OF A

01:10:44.840 --> 01:10:47.610
MILLION THE 10% CUT. WOULD COST

01:10:47.676 --> 01:10:49.945
THE SEVEN HUNDRED THOUSAND AND

01:10:55.618 --> 01:10:56.719
FUNDS WOULD BE NEEDED THAT

01:10:56.785 --> 01:10:59.154
WOULD BE LOST. THE PROPOSED 10%

01:10:59.221 --> 01:11:00.823
CUT WILL PROVIDE CATASTROPHIC

01:11:00.889 --> 01:11:02.625
TO THE FIELD AND MY RESULT IN

01:11:02.691 --> 01:11:04.026
MANY PROVIDERS GOING OUT OF

01:11:04.093 --> 01:11:06.395

IASI ATHLETE IN LAS CAPACITY

01:11:09.865 --> 01:11:11.533
THAT IS ESSENTIAL FOR A STRONG

ECONOMIC RECOVERY AS

01:11:13.268 --> 01:11:14.837
CALIFORNIANS HAD BACK TO WORK

01:11:14.903 --> 01:11:19.274

01:11:19.341 --> 01:11:19.875
VERSUS RESPECT CONNIE. WE ARE

01:11:19.942 --> 01:11:21.276
CONCERNED THAT THE PROPOSED

01:11:21.343 --> 01:11:22.611
MECHANISM OF THE RATE CUTS WILL

01:11:22.678 --> 01:11:23.946

FAMILIES IN SOME PART OF THE

01:11:42.398 --> 01:11:43.632

01:12:26.508 --> 01:12:27.776
GOVERNOR AND HIS STAFF FOR WHAT

01:12:27.843 --> 01:12:28.744
I THINK IT'S BEEN A REALLY

01:12:28.811 --> 01:12:30.579
PHENOMENAL JOB DURING THIS VERY

01:12:30.646 --> 01:12:32.815
DIFFICULT TIME- LEADERSHIP

01:12:32.881 --> 01:12:34.383
REALLY SHINES THROUGH WHEN

01:12:34.450 --> 01:12:35.784
YOU'RE FCED WITH A CRISIS AND

01:12:35.851 --> 01:12:37.686
I THINK THAT OUR GOVERNOR HAS

01:12:37.753 --> 01:12:39.788
LET US VERY WELL. HOWEVER I DO

01:12:39.855 --> 01:12:42.391
HAVE SOME DEEP CONCERNS ABOUT

01:12:42.458 --> 01:12:45.294
THE 10% CUT. TO HEALTH CARE

01:12:45.360 --> 01:12:47.696

TELL YOU WHERE YOUR PRIORITIES

01:12:52.768 --> 01:12:55.304
LIE. BY CUTTING OUR CHILD CARE

01:12:55.370 --> 01:12:57.806
PROVIDERS BY 10% IT SHOWS THAT

01:12:57.873 --> 01:12:59.408
WE'RE NOT PRIORITIZING WORKING

01:12:59.475 --> 01:13:01.677
WOMEN CHILDREN. OR THEIR

01:13:01.744 --> 01:13:03.712
FAMILIES AND AS I STATED ABOUT

OUR OUR CHILD CARE FACILITIES

01:13:13.188 --> 01:13:15.257
UP AND RUNNING. NO ONE GOES

01:13:15.324 --> 01:13:17.059
INTO CHILD CARE BECAUSE THEY

01:13:17.126 --> 01:13:18.293
WANT TO MAKE MONEY ARE THEY

01:13:18.360 --> 01:13:19.661
WANT TO GET RICH THEY DO IT

01:13:19.728 --> 01:13:21.296
BECAUSE THEY LOVE CHILDREN THEY

01:13:21.363 --> 01:13:22.297
LOVE OUR CHILDREN WHILE WE'RE

01:13:22.364 --> 01:13:24.166
AT WORK. THESE ARE SOME OF THE

01:13:24.233 --> 01:13:26.034
LOWEST WAGE WORKERS WHO HAVE

01:13:26.101 --> 01:13:27.436

WORK AND TAKE CARE OF ALL OF US.

01:13:36.378 --> 01:13:38.247
AND AS I SAID ALREADY THE

01:13:38.313 --> 01:13:40.249
ECONOMY DOES NOT RE OPEN

01:13:40.315 --> 01:13:42.251
WITHOUT THESE WOMEN WHO ARE

01:13:42.317 --> 01:13:45.020
DOING THIS JOB. SO I ALSO

01:13:45.087 --> 01:13:47.156
CANNOT SUPPORT A BUDGET THAT

01:13:47.222 --> 01:13:49.424
SUPPORTS A 10% CUT TO CHILD

01:13:49.491 --> 01:13:51.260
CARE SERVICES I KNOW WE CAN

01:13:51.326 --> 01:13:52.895
FIND ANOTHER WAY I KNOW WE CAN

01:13:52.961 --> 01:13:54.663
FIND A BETTER WAY AND I KNOW

01:13:54.730 --> 01:13:56.565
THAT WE CAN DO BETTER BY OUR

01:13:56.632 --> 01:13:58.066

01:17:51.867 --> 01:17:53.235
BIT DIFFERENT THAN WHAT WE'RE

01:17:58.206 --> 01:17:58.807
REFERRING TO SOMETHING THAT'S A

01:17:58.874 --> 01:18:00.876
LITTLE MORE ON CALLING. MAYBE

ASSOCIATED WITH PROVIDING CARE

01:18:19.361 --> 01:18:21.430
DURING THE NINETEEN. SO THIS

01:18:21.496 --> 01:18:22.831
COULD BE THE ONGOING COSTS OF

01:18:22.898 --> 01:18:25.500
CLEANING AND SANITIZING- THE

01:18:25.567 --> 01:18:31.540

LEVELS KERR I ASSUME IT'S A

01:18:48.090 --> 01:18:50.058
FOLLOW UP QUICKLY AS WE MOVE ON

ABOUT THE TITLE FIVE PROVIDERS

01:18:55.664 --> 01:18:57.165
IT WHEN I SEE SERVING THE

01:18:57.232 --> 01:18:59.167
MAXIMUM NUMBER OF CHILDREN. MY

01:18:59.234 --> 01:19:01.403
CONCERN IS JUST LIKE I SAID IF

01:19:01.470 --> 01:19:03.672

START CHILDREN WHO WOULD WANT

01:19:08.643 --> 01:19:10.712
THAT TO HAPPEN. I MY

01:19:10.779 --> 01:19:12.247
UNDERSTANDING THAT THE STIPEND

01:19:12.314 --> 01:19:14.116
MONEY THE HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE

01:19:14.182 --> 01:19:16.351
MILLION- DOESN'T NECESSARY

01:19:16.418 --> 01:19:17.219
THEY'RE KIND OF TWO DIFFERENT

01:19:17.285 --> 01:19:19.254
THINGS SO I'M JUST LOOKING FOR

01:19:19.321 --> 01:19:20.489

CLEARLY ISN'T MAKING ANY MONEY

01:19:24.860 --> 01:19:27.129
BUT HAS STAYED OPEN. AND I

01:19:27.195 --> 01:19:27.963
DON'T KNOW IF I MAKING MYSELF

01:19:28.029 --> 01:19:30.532
CLEAR BUT CAN BE IF IT'S A HOLD

01:19:30.599 --> 01:19:33.268
HARMLESS PROVISION CAN THEY

01:19:33.335 --> 01:19:35.337
STILL BE REIMBURSED THE HEIGHT

01:19:35.403 --> 01:19:37.405
THERE THERE ARE A NUMBER OF

01:19:37.472 --> 01:19:40.542

01:19:45.480 --> 01:19:47.516
RECOMMENDATION HOWEVER I WOULD

01:19:47.582 --> 01:19:48.550

I. I ASSUME THAT THIS THIS HOLD

01:20:00.362 --> 01:20:01.563
HARMLESS WOULD WOULD ACT

01:20:01.630 --> 01:20:03.632
SIMILARLY AND I WOULD TURN.

01:20:03.698 --> 01:20:05.167
OVER THE QUESTION TO YOU. I'M

01:20:05.233 --> 01:20:06.268

OF THE BASE FUNDING. SO

02:00:29.956 --> 02:00:31.591
COMMITTING MIGHT WANT TO

02:00:31.657 --> 02:00:34.927

MIGHT WANT TO CUT THIS PROGRAM

02:01:05.424 --> 02:01:09.528
DEEPER THAN WHAT MADE DOES. ANY

02:01:09.595 --> 02:01:11.197
TURN. THAT MIGHT PROVIDE

02:01:11.263 --> 02:01:12.932
ANOTHER TO PRESERVE AS MUCH AS

02:01:12.999 --> 02:01:15.901
POSSIBLE- BECAUSE THE PROGRAMS

ACHIEVEMENT PROGRAM. WHICH IS

02:01:21.974 --> 02:01:23.609
AIMED AT REDUCING ACHIEVEMENT

02:01:29.515 --> 02:01:31.150
OPPORTUNITY FOR THE LEGISLATURE

02:01:31.217 --> 02:01:34.053

THAN WHAT'S CURRENTLY FIND IT.

02:01:58.778 --> 02:02:00.246
SO THAT'S ANOTHER REASON WHY

02:02:00.312 --> 02:02:02.448
YOU MIGHT WANT TO MINIMIZE. ANY

02:02:02.515 --> 02:02:04.717

SUGGESTIONS. HE DOESN'T. THIS

02:06:47.333 --> 02:06:48.767
IS GOING TO BE CHASING CONSTANT

AWAY. THAT'S INTERESTING

02:06:56.675 --> 02:06:59.011
BECAUSE INTRACELLULAR. FROM THE

02:06:59.078 --> 02:07:01.547
GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL FOCUSED ON

02:07:01.613 --> 02:07:03.816
BASE REDUCTIONS IN OUR VIEW IS

02:07:03.882 --> 02:07:06.185
WARRANTED GIVEN THE STATES OF

02:07:06.251 --> 02:07:08.120
STRUCTURAL BUDGET DEFICIT

02:07:08.187 --> 02:07:09.855
HOWEVER WE WOULD NOTE THAT THE

02:07:09.922 --> 02:07:11.924
TIMING OF THESE RDUCTIONS I'M

02:07:11.991 --> 02:07:13.559
ALL FOR THE SEGMENTS A LITTLE

02:07:13.625 --> 02:07:15.627
TIME TO RESPOND TO THE

02:07:15.694 --> 02:07:16.495
REDUCTIONS IN THE WAY THEY

02:07:16.562 --> 02:07:19.631
HAVE. IN PREVIOUS RECESSIONS

02:07:19.698 --> 02:07:21.166
FOR EXAMPLE ABOVE CERTAIN

02:07:21.233 --> 02:07:22.801
CAMPUS THE CAMPUS IS A BOTH A

02:07:22.868 --> 02:07:24.403
UNIVERSITY SYSTEMS HAVE LARGELY

02:07:24.470 --> 02:07:26.705
MADE FULL ADMISSIONS DECISIONS

02:07:26.772 --> 02:07:28.574
FOR THEIR ABILITY TO ADJUSTABLE

02:07:28.640 --> 02:07:31.143
NEXT ARM IS SOMEWHAT LIMITED AT

02:07:31.210 --> 02:07:34.013
THIS POINT- LIKEWISE- THEIR

02:07:34.079 --> 02:07:35.481
ABILITY TO INCREASE TUITION TO

02:07:35.547 --> 02:07:37.383
OFFSET SOME OF THESE REDUCTIONS

02:07:37.449 --> 02:07:39.018
ALSO SOMEWHAT LIMITED. GIVEN

02:07:39.084 --> 02:07:40.586
THE STUDENT CONSULTATION

02:07:40.652 --> 02:07:45.557
EXPECTATIONS ABOUT. THE

02:07:45.624 --> 02:07:46.058
LEGISLATURE HAS MEETINGS

02:07:46.125 --> 02:07:46.925
SEGMENTS. FROM WHAT MINE ARE IS

02:07:46.992 --> 02:07:48.027
SHE HAS YOU KNOW DIDN'T

02:07:48.093 --> 02:07:48.994
DEVELOPING A MUSTARD OF

02:07:49.061 --> 02:07:50.796
ALTERNATIVE APPROACHES THE

02:07:50.863 --> 02:07:51.563
LEGISLATURE COULD CONSIDER

02:07:51.630 --> 02:07:54.366
TAKING. ON WHAT WITHOUT AIM OF

02:07:54.433 --> 02:07:57.436
REDUCING- I'M OF A NOTABLE

02:07:57.503 --> 02:08:00.839
PORTION OF THE SPACE REDUCTIONS.

02:08:00.906 --> 02:08:02.775
I'M THE STAFF AND SO I WON'T GO

02:08:02.841 --> 02:08:05.911
INTO GREAT DETAIL ABOUT NOT.

02:08:05.978 --> 02:08:07.312
ALTERNATIVELY THAT UP FOR Q. NA

02:08:07.379 --> 02:08:09.548
ALL BUT THE ESSENTIAL ELEMENTS

02:08:09.615 --> 02:08:12.017
OF THE ALTERNATIVE ARE- TO

02:08:12.084 --> 02:08:13.952
REFER MORE ONE TIME I SPEND ONE

02:08:14.019 --> 02:08:15.287
TIME FUNDING THAT WAS PROVIDED

02:08:15.354 --> 02:08:17.122
LAST YEAR'S BUDGET. ONTO BOTH

02:08:17.189 --> 02:08:19.625
UNIVERSITY SEGMENTS- WE THINK

02:08:19.691 --> 02:08:21.393
THERE COULD BE YOU- HELLO

02:08:21.460 --> 02:08:23.295
HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS IN TOTAL

02:08:23.362 --> 02:08:25.464
IT ALL STRESSED AND SAD- COULD

02:08:25.531 --> 02:08:27.466
BE REVERTED MOSTLY FOR-

02:08:27.533 --> 02:08:29.701
DEFERRED MAINTENANCE. AREA WE

02:08:29.768 --> 02:08:30.736
THINK THE LEGISLATURE COULD

02:08:30.803 --> 02:08:33.372
FOCUS A LOT OF ATTENTION ON IS-

02:08:33.439 --> 02:08:35.607
DRYING DOWN CAMPUS RESEARCH

02:08:35.674 --> 02:08:36.809
UNDER THIS APPROACH THE

02:08:36.875 --> 02:08:37.876
LEGISLATURE WOULD STILL

02:08:37.943 --> 02:08:40.512
INACTIVE BUDGET REDUCTION- BUT

02:08:40.579 --> 02:08:41.880
THE SEGMENTS WOULD MAINTAIN A

02:08:41.947 --> 02:08:43.615
PORTION OF THEIR OPERATIONS BY

02:08:43.682 --> 02:08:48.720
DRAWING DOWN RESEARCH. ON BOTH

02:08:48.787 --> 02:08:49.288
SEGMENTS HAD. I JUST OVER A

02:08:49.354 --> 02:08:51.123
DOLLARS IN CORPS RESERVE. I'M

02:08:51.190 --> 02:08:52.391
OUT AND A PORTION OF THOSE

02:08:52.458 --> 02:08:53.459
RESERVES A LOT HUNDREDS OF

02:08:53.525 --> 02:08:55.561
MILLIONS WAS AVAILABLE

02:08:55.627 --> 02:08:58.063
SPECIFICALLY FOR ECONOMIC

02:08:58.130 --> 02:09:00.499
UNCERTAINTIES AND AT. A CERTAIN

02:09:00.566 --> 02:09:02.167
ADVANCED FOR COMMITTED TO

02:09:02.234 --> 02:09:04.336
CERTAIN CASTALDO CAMPUSES MIGHT

02:09:04.403 --> 02:09:06.071
BE TRYING TO REVISIT SOME OF

02:09:06.138 --> 02:09:07.306
THESE COMMITMENTS IN LIGHT OF

02:09:07.372 --> 02:09:09.174
THE CURRENT OUTBREAK. I'M

02:09:09.241 --> 02:09:10.242
LOOKING AT THE DATA WE FELT

02:09:10.309 --> 02:09:12.544
THAT MAYBE UP TO TWO HUNDRED

02:09:12.611 --> 02:09:13.946
MILLION ACTS YES YOU HAVE UP TO

02:09:14.012 --> 02:09:15.581
A HUNDRED MILLION THAT YOU SEE-

02:09:15.647 --> 02:09:17.382
COULD BE DRAWN DOWN FOR

02:09:17.449 --> 02:09:20.152
RESEARCH TO HELP MITIGATE.

02:09:20.219 --> 02:09:22.287
PRODUCTIONS WE HAD A FEW

02:09:22.354 --> 02:09:24.089
OPTIONS TO MAYBE OFFER SOME

02:09:24.156 --> 02:09:25.524
MORE TARGETED REDUCTIONS WERE

02:09:25.591 --> 02:09:27.359
THOSE JOBS STILL NEEDED EVEN IN

02:09:27.426 --> 02:09:29.228
LIGHT OF. WE'RE SENDING ONE

02:09:29.294 --> 02:09:30.429
TIME FUNDING AND DRAWING DOWN

02:09:30.496 --> 02:09:32.231
RESERVES FOR EXAMPLE FOR YOU

02:09:32.297 --> 02:09:34.433
SEE POTENTIALLY TARGETING SOME

02:09:34.500 --> 02:09:35.534
REDUCTIONS TOWARDS PROGRAMS

02:09:35.601 --> 02:09:37.736
THAT- ARE LESS RELATED TO

02:09:37.803 --> 02:09:39.304
INSTRUCTION OR A NEED BASED

02:09:39.371 --> 02:09:42.407
FINANCIAL AID FOR STUDENTS TO

02:09:42.474 --> 02:09:42.908
THINGS LIKE RESEARCH FOR

02:09:42.975 --> 02:09:44.643
EXAMPLE. ONE MORE THING I WOULD

02:09:44.710 --> 02:09:45.944
EMPHASIZE IS THAT WHERE THE

02:09:46.011 --> 02:09:47.980
LEGISLATURE TAKE ALL APPROACH.

02:09:48.046 --> 02:09:49.548
THE LEGISLATURE WOULD STILL.

02:09:49.615 --> 02:09:51.650
FACE DFFICULT DECISIONS IN THE

02:09:51.717 --> 02:09:52.684
FOLLOWING BUDGET SO IT'S NOT A

02:09:52.751 --> 02:09:54.686
PERMANENT SOLUTION THE- IDEA

02:09:54.753 --> 02:09:56.622
HERE WOULD BE TO MINIMIZE MOST

02:09:56.688 --> 02:09:59.091
OF THE REDUCTIONS. AND GIVE

02:09:59.158 --> 02:09:59.691
BOTH UNIVERSITY SEGMENTS MORE

02:09:59.758 --> 02:10:01.160
TIME TO RESPOND TO START

02:10:01.226 --> 02:10:02.427
THINKING ABOUT AND WILL NEED TO

02:10:02.494 --> 02:10:03.595
START THINKING ABOUT TUITION

02:10:03.662 --> 02:10:05.697
AND START THINKING ABOUT-

02:10:05.764 --> 02:10:06.698
YOU'RE VERY DEFICIENCIES

02:10:06.765 --> 02:10:08.467
OPERATIONAL REDUCTIONS OF ANY

02:10:08.534 --> 02:10:11.870
GIVE YOU MORE TIME TO REVIEW

02:10:11.937 --> 02:10:12.538
THAT SEARCH. ENGINES ARE MAKING.

02:10:12.604 --> 02:10:14.306
IS IT YOUR THOUGHT THAT. WE

02:10:14.373 --> 02:10:17.042
WOULD ALLOW THE US TO SYSTEMS

02:10:17.109 --> 02:10:17.643
WHETHER IT'S YOU SEE YOUR C.

02:10:17.709 --> 02:10:20.512
ISSUE. TO DETERMINE WHICH

02:10:20.579 --> 02:10:22.414
DEFERRED MAINTENANCE PROJECTS

02:10:22.481 --> 02:10:24.650
TO PROCEED WITH AND SOME THAT

02:10:24.716 --> 02:10:26.018
BOOK PERHAPS ARE DEEMED

02:10:26.084 --> 02:10:27.219
ESSENTIAL WOULD BE ALLOWED TO

02:10:27.286 --> 02:10:29.188
PROCEED AND THOSE THAT. ARE

02:10:29.254 --> 02:10:31.490
DEEMED LESS ESSENTIAL SINCE I'M

02:10:31.557 --> 02:10:33.559
SURE THEY'RE ALL ESSENTIAL BUT

02:10:33.625 --> 02:10:34.059
LESS ESSENTIAL UNDER THE

02:10:34.126 --> 02:10:36.028
CURRENT ENVIRONMENT. WOULD BE

02:10:36.094 --> 02:10:37.462
POSTPONED AND THAT MONEY

02:10:37.529 --> 02:10:38.797
DIVERTED TO ALLOW THEM TO

02:10:38.864 --> 02:10:40.432
DIVERT THAT THE INSTITUTION TO

02:10:40.499 --> 02:10:44.436
DIVERT TAT MONEY. INTO CORPS

02:10:44.503 --> 02:10:46.238
CORE FUNCTION. YEAH THAT'S

02:10:46.305 --> 02:10:46.738
THAT'S CORRECT WE WERE

02:10:46.805 --> 02:10:51.443
THINKING- BUT BASICALLY THAT

02:10:51.510 --> 02:10:52.010
WITH THE FUNDS HAVEN'T BEEN

02:10:52.077 --> 02:10:54.012
COMMITTED. ALREADY FUNDS THAT

02:10:54.079 --> 02:10:54.713
HAVE BEEN COMMITTED TO ANY

02:10:54.780 --> 02:10:56.048
PROJECT JUST SIMPLY BE

02:10:56.114 --> 02:10:58.283
REVERTED. TO THE CENTER OF THE

02:10:58.350 --> 02:10:59.184
FUNDS HAVE ALREADY BEEN

02:10:59.251 --> 02:11:00.619
COMMITTED- OBVIOUSLY THOSE

02:11:00.686 --> 02:11:01.954
WOULD BE AVAILABLE FOR

02:11:02.020 --> 02:11:03.455
RECURSION BUT ANY ANY CASE

02:11:03.522 --> 02:11:04.323
WHERE THE FUNDS ARE SPENT WE

02:11:04.389 --> 02:11:08.460
WOULD THINK. WOULD BE WE WOULD

02:11:08.527 --> 02:11:09.027
WE WOULD THINK DIVERT THOSE

02:11:09.094 --> 02:11:12.264
FUNDS. THERE IS TO THE CAMPUS

02:11:12.331 --> 02:11:14.399
RESERVE A CAMPUS RESERVES THE

02:11:14.466 --> 02:11:16.535
SAME. A LOT OF SYSTEMS TO

02:11:16.602 --> 02:11:18.737
DETERMINE. THE LEVEL OF

02:11:18.804 --> 02:11:21.240
RESERVES AT STATE MINIMUM

02:11:21.306 --> 02:11:23.175
ESSENTIAL LEVEL OF RESERVE AND-

02:11:23.242 --> 02:11:26.044
AND BURN THROUGH THE REST IF

02:11:26.111 --> 02:11:26.578
NECESSARY TO SUPPORT CORE

02:11:26.645 --> 02:11:31.116
FUNCTION. YEAH HERE WE WERE

02:11:31.183 --> 02:11:32.451
THINKING THAT THE LEGISLATURE

02:11:32.517 --> 02:11:33.752
WOULD WORK WITH THE SEGMENTS

02:11:33.819 --> 02:11:36.922
TO- THINK ABOUT AT A HIGH LEVEL

02:11:36.989 --> 02:11:38.457
OF YOU KNOW RESERVES THAT WOULD

02:11:38.523 --> 02:11:40.225
BE AVAILABLE TO BE DRAWN DOWN

02:11:40.292 --> 02:11:41.693
AGAIN WE SORT OF. JUST LOOKING

02:11:41.760 --> 02:11:43.462
OUT THERE- RESERVES PRIOR TO

02:11:43.528 --> 02:11:45.530
THE OUTBREAK. SINCE YOU THE

02:11:45.597 --> 02:11:46.598
RECORD HOLDER RESERVED FOR

02:11:46.665 --> 02:11:48.400
ABOUT ONE POINT FIVE BILLION

02:11:48.467 --> 02:11:50.202
YOU SEE WAS ABOUT ONE POINT ONE

02:11:50.269 --> 02:11:53.505
BILLION- OF THAT AMOUNT MOST.

02:11:53.572 --> 02:11:54.840
DIFFICULT PORTION WAS COMMITTED

02:11:54.906 --> 02:11:56.908
FOR THINGS LIKE CONTRACTS. IN

02:11:56.975 --> 02:11:58.777
NEW FACULTY STARTUP CONTRACTS

02:11:58.844 --> 02:12:01.046
AND CAPITAL OUTLAY THE REST WAS

02:12:01.113 --> 02:12:03.315
UNRESTRICTED. ON IN ANY CASE IF

02:12:03.382 --> 02:12:04.316
YOU SEE IN SOME CASES THERE

02:12:04.383 --> 02:12:07.519
AREN'T EVEN FORMAL POLICIES ON.

02:12:07.586 --> 02:12:09.221
A DESIGNATED THINGS RESERVED

02:12:09.288 --> 02:12:10.188
FOR SPECIFIC PRIORITIES AND SO

02:12:10.255 --> 02:12:12.124
WE FELT KIND OF LOOKING AT THAT

02:12:12.190 --> 02:12:13.825
DATA AND SERVER RECOGNIZING

02:12:13.892 --> 02:12:14.626
THAT THERE MIGHT BE SOME

02:12:14.693 --> 02:12:15.827
DEFICIT SPENDING GOING ON

02:12:15.894 --> 02:12:20.198
CURRENTLY. BUT ALSO THAT THERE

02:12:20.265 --> 02:12:21.800
COULD BE SOME. RIGHT COULD BE

02:12:21.867 --> 02:12:24.369
MAKING TO TRY THAT- ELEVEN

02:12:24.436 --> 02:12:25.470
REDUCE SOME OF THE COMMITMENTS

02:12:25.537 --> 02:12:27.472
THEY MADE WE THOUGHT THOSE TWO

02:12:27.539 --> 02:12:28.340
HUNDRED MILLION A HUNDRED

02:12:28.407 --> 02:12:30.242
MILLION LEVELS COULD BE A

02:12:30.309 --> 02:12:31.143
REASONABLE STARTING POINT FOR

02:12:31.209 --> 02:12:32.611
THE LEGISLATURE BUT THAT WAS

02:12:32.678 --> 02:12:33.245
THAT'S WHAT IT WOULD BE A

02:12:33.312 --> 02:12:35.881
REASONABLE STARTING POINT FOR

02:12:35.947 --> 02:12:37.683
DISCUSSION. SECONDS I'LL BE

02:12:37.749 --> 02:12:39.351
INTERESTED IN HEARING FROM THE-

02:12:39.418 --> 02:12:41.019
THE INSTITUTIONS OTHER

02:12:41.086 --> 02:12:44.056
PERSPECTIVE IS THE AUTHOR.

02:12:44.122 --> 02:12:46.491
THAT'S IT THANK YOU OKAY ABOUT

FINANCE IN LA- HAVE DISCUSSED

02:13:07.179 --> 02:13:09.247
THE STATE IS FACING SIGNIFICANT

02:13:09.314 --> 02:13:10.716
LOSS OF REVENUE FROM CODE

02:13:10.782 --> 02:13:12.517
NINETEEN AND UNIVERSITY OF

02:25:21.546 --> 02:25:23.214
REDUCTION THAT'S A 10%

02:25:23.281 --> 02:25:25.850
REDUCTION TO OUR GENERAL FUND

02:25:25.917 --> 02:25:29.420

02:25:29.487 --> 02:25:31.322

CLEARLY IS FORMIDABLE MOREOVER

02:25:46.137 --> 02:25:48.372
THE ACTUAL IMPACT TO SEIZE YOUR

02:25:48.439 --> 02:25:49.907
BUDGET IS MORE SIGNIFICANT

02:25:49.974 --> 02:25:51.576
BECAUSE WE HAVE CLOSE TO ONE

02:25:51.642 --> 02:25:53.344
HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS OF MORE

02:25:53.411 --> 02:25:55.513

THEREFORE WE RESPECTFULLY

02:26:00.384 --> 02:26:02.120
REQUEST THAT THE LEGISLATURE

02:26:02.186 --> 02:26:03.254

02:26:03.321 --> 02:26:04.589

OPERATIONS AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE.

02:26:09.494 --> 02:26:11.362
ONE POSSIBLE PATH IS TO ADOPT

02:26:11.429 --> 02:26:12.096
THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S

02:26:12.163 --> 02:26:13.865

UNSPENT CURRENT YOUR DOLLARS

02:26:15.333 --> 02:26:18.002
AND LESSENS THE REDUCTION BY

02:26:18.069 --> 02:26:18.603
THE SAME AMOUNT IN THE BUDGET

02:26:18.669 --> 02:26:20.238
YEAR. IN FACT WE RECOMMEND THAT

02:26:20.304 --> 02:26:23.174
THE ONLY ALTERNATIVE BEADOPTED

02:26:23.241 --> 02:26:23.808

YEAR BUDGET CHANGE IT PROVIDES

02:26:31.782 --> 02:26:34.385
US TEMPORARY RELIEF. IF HE L.

02:26:34.452 --> 02:26:36.053
A. O.'S ALTERNATE IS ADOPTED IT

02:26:36.120 --> 02:26:37.655
COULD REDUCE THE BUDGET YOUR

02:26:37.722 --> 02:26:40.224
CUTS THIS ISSUE BY AS MUCH AS

02:26:40.291 --> 02:26:40.758
ONE HUNDRED SIXTY MILLION

02:26:40.825 --> 02:26:43.261

MAGNITUDE OF THE POTENTIAL CUTS

02:26:57.375 --> 02:27:00.444
TO THE CSU IS DAUNTING- WE

02:27:00.511 --> 02:27:00.912
LEARNED FROM THE GREAT

02:27:00.978 --> 02:27:03.681
RECESSION. AND WE THAT SEES YOU

02:27:03.748 --> 02:27:04.882
CURRENTLY HAVE A NUMBER OF

02:27:04.949 --> 02:27:06.751
TOOLS TO BE ABLE TO MITIGATE

02:27:06.817 --> 02:27:08.719
THE IMPACT ON OUR STUDENTS OR

02:27:08.786 --> 02:27:10.755
FACULTY OR STAFF. HE SEES YOU

02:27:10.821 --> 02:27:12.590
AS PRUDENTLY GROW RESERVES TO

MEET CERTAIN STRATEGIC GOALS.

02:27:14.825 --> 02:27:15.459
ONE OF WHICH HAS BEEN

02:27:15.526 --> 02:27:17.428
PREPARATION FOR POSSIBLE

02:27:17.495 --> 02:27:20.698
ECONOMIC UNCERTAINTY. I THINK

02:27:20.765 --> 02:27:21.265
YOU SHOULD DRAW UPON THESE

02:27:21.332 --> 02:27:22.833
RESERVES ALREADY TO MAINTAIN

NINETEEN. AND WE WILL CONTINUE

02:27:27.805 --> 02:27:29.707

RESERVES UP WHICH ARE ONE TIME

02:27:31.442 --> 02:27:33.010
FUNDS CANNOT BE A PERMANENT

02:27:33.077 --> 02:27:34.979
SOLUTION. BUT THEY ARE A

02:27:35.046 --> 02:27:36.447
VALUABLE ASSET THAT CAN BE

02:27:36.514 --> 02:27:39.483
UTILIZED UNTIL SUCH TIME AS

02:27:39.550 --> 02:27:39.951
OTHER RESOURCES BECOME

02:27:40.017 --> 02:27:42.253
AVAILABLE. OUR CAMPUSES ALSO

02:27:42.320 --> 02:27:43.654
HAVE RECEIVED FUNDING FROM

02:27:43.721 --> 02:27:45.790
FEDERAL CARERS ACT FUNDING

02:27:45.856 --> 02:27:46.757
WHICH WILL MITIGATE SOME OF THE

02:27:46.824 --> 02:27:49.260
COSTS AND LOSSES REVENUE LOSSES

02:27:49.327 --> 02:27:51.362

AND REDUCE NONESSENTIAL TRAVEL

02:27:55.266 --> 02:27:57.735
BOTH OF WHICH WILL SAVE MANY

02:27:57.802 --> 02:27:58.302
MILLIONS OF DOLLARS FOR THE

02:27:58.369 --> 02:28:00.438

TO STUDENTS FACULTY AND STAFF.

02:29:00.898 --> 02:29:02.500
AS WE LOOK TO THE FALL IN THE

FUTURE THERE ARE A HANDFUL OF

02:29:04.468 --> 02:29:06.337
ITEMS FOR YOU TO KEEP IN MIND.

02:29:06.404 --> 02:29:08.039

COURSES PRIMARY PRIMARILY BEING

02:29:13.611 --> 02:29:16.314

ACTIVITIES THAT CANNOT BE

DELIVERED VIRTUALLY. THERE WILL

02:29:22.853 --> 02:29:24.388
BE HYBRID APPROACHES AND THERE

02:29:24.455 --> 02:29:26.023
WILL BE A VARIABILITY ACROSS

02:29:26.090 --> 02:29:28.059
THE TWENTY THREE CAMPUSES. DUE

02:29:28.125 --> 02:29:29.727
TO SPECIFIC CONTEXTS AND

02:29:29.794 --> 02:29:32.997
CIRCUMSTANCES. PUBLIC HEALTH

02:29:33.064 --> 02:29:34.265
EXPERTS PREDICT WAVES OF

02:29:34.332 --> 02:29:37.568
INFECTION. IN LATE FALL TWENTY

02:29:37.635 --> 02:29:39.470
TWENTY IN EARLY TWENTY TWENTY

02:29:39.537 --> 02:29:40.504
ONE AND IF WE WERE TO BEGIN FOR

02:29:40.571 --> 02:29:42.173
A FACE TO FACE MODALITY WE

02:29:42.239 --> 02:29:43.474
WOULD LIKELY HAVE TO SWITCH TO

02:29:43.541 --> 02:29:46.610
A VIRTUAL FORMAT AND THAT WOULD

02:29:46.677 --> 02:29:48.879
COMPROMISE RIGOROUS STANDARDS.

02:29:48.946 --> 02:29:50.915
FIFTY AND WELFARE. SECOND AS I

02:29:50.981 --> 02:29:52.383
NOTED EARLIER THE UNIVERSITY IS

02:29:52.450 --> 02:29:53.751
MORE THAN JUST ACADEMIC AND

02:29:53.818 --> 02:29:55.853
STUDENT SUPPORTS INCLUDES STATE

02:29:55.920 --> 02:29:57.188

PARKING AND STUDENT CENTERS.

02:30:01.892 --> 02:30:03.761
SOME OF THESE PROGRAM AREAS ARE

02:30:03.828 --> 02:30:04.929
UNCHARACTERISTICALLY

02:30:04.995 --> 02:30:06.964
INSIGNIFICANT THIS STRESS

02:30:07.031 --> 02:30:08.499
BECAUSE STUDENTS EMPLOYEES AND

02:30:08.566 --> 02:30:09.767
THE PUBLIC ARE LARGELY ABSENT

02:30:09.834 --> 02:30:11.669
FROM OUR CAMPUSES. THESE

02:30:11.736 --> 02:30:13.337
CHALLENGES COULD NEGATIVELY

02:30:13.404 --> 02:30:14.305
IMPACT OTHER AREAS OF THE

02:30:14.372 --> 02:30:16.407
UNIVERSITY. BUT THAT HAS NOT

02:30:16.474 --> 02:30:18.209
HAPPENED YET. BUT WE'RE WORKING

02:30:18.275 --> 02:30:20.878
TO AVOID THAT- AGAIN BUT WE ARE%

02:30:20.945 --> 02:30:22.413
AWARE THAT IT COULD BE THAT BUT

02:30:22.480 --> 02:30:26.851
I WANTYOU TO BE AWARE THAT IT.

02:30:26.917 --> 02:30:27.318
COULD BECOME A SERIOUS

02:30:27.385 --> 02:30:27.918
CHALLENGE IN THE FUTURE. OUR

02:30:27.985 --> 02:30:29.220
PUBLIC HIGHER EDUCATION HAS TO

02:30:29.286 --> 02:30:31.055
BE A PRIORITY. IN THE STATE NOW

02:30:31.122 --> 02:30:32.456
AND IN THE FUTURE REMEMBER THEY

02:30:32.523 --> 02:30:34.592
SEE ISSUE IS THE LARGEST FOUR

02:30:34.658 --> 02:30:35.760
YEAR PUBLIC UNIVERSITY IN THE

02:30:35.826 --> 02:30:37.762
COUNTRY. IN HALF OF ALL NEW

DEGREES THE STATE NEEDS TO KEEP

02:30:39.397 --> 02:30:41.932
THIS THING MOVING FORWARD

02:30:41.999 --> 02:30:42.566
ORIGINALLY OUT OF THE C. ISSUE.

02:30:42.633 --> 02:30:44.368

BE A BEACON OF OPPORTUNITY AND

02:30:56.714 --> 02:30:58.382
SOCIAL MOBILITY IN THE GOOD

02:30:58.449 --> 02:31:01.752
TIMES AND NOT SO GOOD TIMES.

02:31:01.819 --> 02:31:03.854
THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU

02:31:03.921 --> 02:31:05.456

GIVE ME AN EXAMPLE OF

02:31:06.524 --> 02:31:08.292
RESTRICTED FUNDS AND THEN THE

02:31:08.359 --> 02:31:10.127
USE WHAT TYPE OF FUNDS ARE WE

02:31:10.194 --> 02:31:13.364
TALKING ABOUT. SURE YEAH THERE

02:31:13.431 --> 02:31:15.733
ARE THERE ARE SEVERAL OF THEM.

02:31:15.800 --> 02:31:18.803
B. R. MANY YEARS AGO AND THERE

02:31:18.869 --> 02:31:20.304
WERE A NUMBER OF ITEMS THAT

02:31:20.371 --> 02:31:21.906
WERE CREATED IN STATE LAW THAT

02:31:21.972 --> 02:31:23.174
AND THESE ARE STUDENTS SUPPORT

02:31:23.240 --> 02:31:24.909
SERVICES SO THERE ARE THERE

02:31:24.975 --> 02:31:26.677
SUCH THINGS AND START TORIES.

02:31:26.744 --> 02:31:28.746
ARE PARKING THEIR STUDENT

UNIONS THERE STUDENT CENTERS-

02:31:30.981 --> 02:31:32.883
HEALTH CENTERS AND THE WAY THAT

02:31:32.950 --> 02:31:34.685
IT STRUCTURALLY WORKS IN

02:31:34.752 --> 02:31:39.290
STATUTE IS ESSENTIALLY ALL.

02:31:39.356 --> 02:31:40.024
CRAZY BUT IT'S JUST BASICALLY.

02:31:40.090 --> 02:31:40.925
IF YOU IF YOU COLLECT REVENUES

02:31:40.991 --> 02:31:41.759
TO SUPPORT A PARTICULAR

02:31:41.826 --> 02:31:43.427
ACTIVITY YOU HAVE TO USE THAT

02:31:43.494 --> 02:31:44.995
MONEY ON THOSE THINGS SO FOR

02:31:45.062 --> 02:31:46.464
EXAMPLE WE COLLECT REVENUES FOR

02:31:46.530 --> 02:31:47.798
DORMS WHICH REVIEW. YOU CAN

02:31:47.865 --> 02:31:50.401
ONLY USE THEM FOR DORMER HOUSE

02:31:50.468 --> 02:31:53.003
STUDENT HOUSING. THESE WHAT

02:31:53.070 --> 02:31:55.005
WE'RE CONCERNED ABOUT- MAYBE

02:31:55.072 --> 02:31:57.074
NOT IMMEDIATELY- WE'RE STILL

02:31:57.141 --> 02:31:58.909
ANALYZING ALL OF OUR OPTIONS

02:31:58.976 --> 02:32:01.645
AND- CASH FLOW ON ART. HISTORY

02:32:01.712 --> 02:32:04.381
PROGRAMS BY CAMPUS- SO THERE'S

02:32:04.448 --> 02:32:05.449
A LOT OF YOU KNOW TWENTY THREE

02:32:05.516 --> 02:32:06.717
TIMES. ALL THE DIFFERENT

02:32:06.784 --> 02:32:08.319
PROGRAMS THERE'S A LOT OF

02:32:08.385 --> 02:32:09.153
DIFFERENT MEDICATIONS THAT CAN

02:32:09.220 --> 02:32:11.288
OCCUR. BUT WE DO ANTICIPATE

02:32:11.355 --> 02:32:12.490
THAT AT SOME POINT IN THE

02:32:12.556 --> 02:32:16.293
FUTURE IF CONDITIONS PERSIST

02:32:16.360 --> 02:32:17.628
THAT WE MAY HAVE TO. YOU

02:32:17.695 --> 02:32:19.463
REALIZE SOME MONIES THAT MIGHT

02:32:19.530 --> 02:32:21.999
BE. WE MIGHT HAVE MORE RESERVES

02:32:22.066 --> 02:32:23.667
SAY MAYBE IN PARKING AND MAYBE

02:32:23.734 --> 02:32:26.604
SHIPPED IT TO HOUSING TO HELP

02:32:26.670 --> 02:32:28.906
SUPPORT HOUSING. TEMPORARILY OR

02:32:28.973 --> 02:32:31.141
IF OR YOU KNOW TWO DIFFERENT

02:32:31.208 --> 02:32:32.409
FUNDS IN THAT WAY SO THAT'S

02:32:32.476 --> 02:32:33.277
THAT'S REALLY WHAT THAT

02:32:33.344 --> 02:32:34.245
FLEXIBILITY IS TRYING TO DO IS

02:32:34.311 --> 02:32:35.379
JUST HAVE THAT TOOL AT OUR

02:32:35.446 --> 02:32:36.247
DISPOSAL LIKE I SAID IN MY

02:32:36.313 --> 02:32:37.815
COMMENTS WE DON'T THINK THAT WE

02:32:37.882 --> 02:32:39.450
NEED TO UTILIZE IT RIGHT AWAY-

02:32:39.517 --> 02:32:41.318
BUT WE THINK THAT IF THE

02:32:41.385 --> 02:32:42.753
PROJECTIONS ARE CORRECT THEY

02:32:42.820 --> 02:32:44.922
WERE ENOUGH FOR YOUR- REALLY

02:32:44.989 --> 02:32:46.790
BAD TOUGH. BUDGET SITUATION WE

02:32:46.857 --> 02:32:48.759
REALLY ANTICIPATE THAT OF ALL

02:32:48.826 --> 02:32:50.361
OF OUR CAMPUSES ALL THOSE

02:32:50.427 --> 02:32:51.729
VARIOUS PROGRAMS THAT WE WILL

02:32:51.795 --> 02:32:52.530
RUN INTO A SITUATION WHERE WE

02:32:52.596 --> 02:32:54.064
DO NOT HAVE THE FLEXIBILITY TO

02:32:54.131 --> 02:32:58.602
BE ABLE TO ADDRESS-

02:32:58.669 --> 02:32:59.203
DEFICIENCIES IN THOSE AREAS.

ECONOMICALLY COMPARABLE TO

THE CAL GRANT AWARD WORTH 17%

ATTENDING UC IT'S INCREASED

02:43:50.620 --> 02:43:54.524
2210026% THE UNDERLYING POLICY

02:43:54.591 --> 02:43:55.525
AND STATUTE THAT PERMITS THIS

02:43:55.592 --> 02:43:57.527
CAT. HAS TO DO WITH THE

02:43:57.594 --> 02:43:58.361
ASSOCIATE DEGREE FOR TRANSFER

02:43:58.428 --> 02:43:59.963

BRIEFLY SPEAK ABOUT AND MY APPS

02:44:01.665 --> 02:44:04.134
LIES THAT YOU SHOULD HAVE. A

02:44:04.201 --> 02:44:06.436
WALK THROUGH THAT. IF YOU LOOK

02:44:06.503 --> 02:44:06.970
AT THE TIME LINE WHICH IS

02:44:07.037 --> 02:44:10.040
SLATED TO- YOU'LL SEE THAT

02:44:10.106 --> 02:44:12.442
THERE HAS BEEN A LOT OF WORK

02:44:12.509 --> 02:44:13.810
DONE IN A RELATIVELY SHORT

02:44:13.877 --> 02:44:15.779
AMOUNT OF TIME. SINCE THE

02:44:15.845 --> 02:44:17.280
AGREEMENT WAS REACHED IN THE

02:44:17.347 --> 02:44:20.183
SUMMER OF TWENTY EIGHTEEN- YOU

02:44:20.250 --> 02:44:21.351
KNOW A FEW MONTHS LATER THAT

02:44:21.418 --> 02:44:23.620
FALL WE HAD THIRTY OR

02:44:23.687 --> 02:44:24.788
INSTITUTIONS YOU'VE GOT

02:44:24.854 --> 02:44:26.623
ARTICULATED PATHWAYS AND BEGAN

02:44:26.690 --> 02:44:27.824
ACCEPTING. AT EIGHTY T.

02:44:27.891 --> 02:44:30.093
APPLICATIONS- JUST A SHORT TIME

02:44:30.160 --> 02:44:32.862
LATER. AND WHAT WE SEE NOW AS

02:44:32.929 --> 02:44:34.864
OF THIS PAST FALL. IF WE DON'T

02:44:34.931 --> 02:44:36.333
HAVE THIRTY NINE INSTITUTIONS

02:44:36.399 --> 02:44:38.401
THAT ARE PARTICIPATING WITH

02:44:38.468 --> 02:44:41.705
ARTICULATED PATHWAYS ACROSS ALL

02:44:41.771 --> 02:44:43.173
THIRTY SIX EIGHTY MAJORS. AND

02:44:43.240 --> 02:44:44.941
SO THE FACT TODAY IS THAT THE

02:44:45.008 --> 02:44:45.775
MAJORITY OF EIGHTY

02:44:45.842 --> 02:44:46.943
PARTICIPATING INSTITUTIONS

02:44:47.010 --> 02:44:48.278
THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF

CALIFORNIA OR A. I. C. C. O. S.

02:44:50.347 --> 02:44:51.581
T. SHINS AND KNEES PROVIDE

02:44:51.648 --> 02:44:54.017
TREMENDOUS REGIONAL ACCESS FOR

TRANSFER STUDENTS. ON THE NEXT

02:44:56.119 --> 02:44:56.553
FLIGHT JUST GIVES YOU A

02:44:56.620 --> 02:44:59.456
SNAPSHOT. OF OUR PARTICIPATING

02:44:59.522 --> 02:45:00.156
INSTITUTIONS BROKEN DOWN BY

02:45:00.223 --> 02:45:03.860
REGION- AND SLIDES FOR GIVES

02:45:03.927 --> 02:45:06.796
YOU A SENSE OF WHAT ARE CALLED

02:45:06.863 --> 02:45:08.531
DATA ALL TWENTY NINETEEN EXCUSE

02:45:08.598 --> 02:45:11.101
ME COLLECTION LOOKS LIKE-BUT

02:45:11.167 --> 02:45:12.902
I'D LIKE TO TURN TO SLIDE FIVE-

02:45:12.969 --> 02:45:14.904
WHICH GIVES YOU. THE THREE

02:45:14.971 --> 02:45:16.139
REPORTING PERIODS AND THE

02:45:16.206 --> 02:45:19.409
TRENDS WE'VE SEEN- AND I WANT

02:45:19.476 --> 02:45:20.210
TO SAY YOU KNOW THERE HAVE BEEN

02:45:20.277 --> 02:45:22.212
CHALLENGES IN IMPLEMENTING THIS

02:45:22.279 --> 02:45:23.480
PROGRAM THERE'S NO DOUBT ABOUT

02:45:23.546 --> 02:45:24.547
THAT. YOU'RE CREATING THESE

02:45:24.614 --> 02:45:26.249
PATHWAYS IN THE TRAINING AND

02:45:26.316 --> 02:45:27.851
TIME NEEDED ACROSS MULTIPLE

02:45:27.917 --> 02:45:28.718
DEPARTMENTS AT THE

02:45:28.785 --> 02:45:30.587
INSTITUTIONAL LEVEL. FOR STAFF

02:45:30.654 --> 02:45:31.454
TO IDENTIFY AND COLLECT THIS

02:45:31.521 --> 02:45:34.124
DATA AS WELL AS INCREASING THE

02:45:34.190 --> 02:45:35.558
AWARENESS OF THESE PATHWAYS FOR

02:45:35.625 --> 02:45:37.694
STUDENTS. THE WHAT I THINK

02:45:37.761 --> 02:45:38.628
YOU'LL SEE THERE IS THERE'S

02:45:38.695 --> 02:45:41.231
BEEN. A SIGNIFICANT GROWTH IN

02:45:41.298 --> 02:45:42.732
YEAR TWO IN TERMS OF THE NUMBER

02:45:42.799 --> 02:45:47.937
OF EIGHTY STUDENTS EXPECTED.

02:45:48.004 --> 02:45:49.272
ARE THE NUMBER OF PARTICIPATING

02:45:49.339 --> 02:45:53.176
INSTITUTIONS. OUT CERTAINLY. AT

02:45:53.243 --> 02:45:53.777
THE NUMBER OF PARTICIPATING SO

02:45:53.843 --> 02:45:54.511
THAT THAT AGAIN ARE ON THESE

02:45:54.577 --> 02:45:55.612
BUT NOT RECEIVING ANY

02:45:55.679 --> 02:45:57.447
APPLICANTS HAS GONE DOWN

02:45:57.514 --> 02:45:59.382
SIGNIFICANTLY- WELL WE'VE SEEN

02:45:59.449 --> 02:46:00.350
THE NUMBER OF INSTITUTIONS ARE

02:46:00.417 --> 02:46:02.819
RECEIVING OUTLOOK AND STUBBLE-

02:46:02.886 --> 02:46:04.621
IN JUST A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME

02:46:04.688 --> 02:46:06.022
AND YOU KNOW THIS. I WOULD ADD

02:46:06.089 --> 02:46:08.792
THAT THIS METRIC- IN STATUTE IS

02:46:08.858 --> 02:46:09.759
ONLY EIGHTY TWO TRANSFER

02:46:09.826 --> 02:46:11.795
STUDENTS IT'S NOT ACCOUNTING

02:46:11.861 --> 02:46:13.430
FOR OTHER TRANSFER STUDENTS.

02:46:13.496 --> 02:46:14.364
THAT ARE COMING TO OUR

02:46:14.431 --> 02:46:16.333
INSTITUTIONS THROUGH OTHER

02:46:16.399 --> 02:46:18.702
LOCAL ARTICULATION AGREEMENTS

02:46:18.768 --> 02:46:21.204
STAR SECTOR REMAINS COMMITTED

02:46:21.271 --> 02:46:22.005
TO PROMOTING AND GROWING

02:46:22.072 --> 02:46:23.273
TRANSFER PATHWAYS SUCH AS EACH

02:46:23.340 --> 02:46:25.308
KEY WHICH YOU CAN PROVIDE SOME

02:46:25.375 --> 02:46:27.310
REALLY IMPORTANT- TRANSFER

02:46:27.377 --> 02:46:28.611
PATHWAYS TO BE FINE STUDENTS

02:46:28.678 --> 02:46:30.246
ARE REALLY UTILIZING. AT THE

02:46:30.313 --> 02:46:32.482
REGIONAL LEVEL I'M IF YOU LOOK

02:46:32.549 --> 02:46:34.217
AT THE LAST COUPLE OF SLIDES

02:46:34.284 --> 02:46:36.319
YOU'LL JUST SEE SOME EXAMPLES

02:46:36.386 --> 02:46:37.087
OF DIFFERENT TYPES OF

02:46:37.153 --> 02:46:38.421
INSTITUTIONS AND HOW THOSE

02:46:38.488 --> 02:46:41.124
TRANSFER PATHWAYS. ARE

02:46:41.191 --> 02:46:42.759
FUNCTIONING ON THE GROUND.

02:46:42.826 --> 02:46:44.227
FUNDAMENTALLY YOU KNOW WE

02:46:44.294 --> 02:46:45.261
BELIEVE THAT THE TRENDS WE SEE

02:46:45.328 --> 02:46:47.063
IN OUR DATA. SUGGESTS THAT THE

02:46:47.130 --> 02:46:48.698
PROGRAM IS IMPROVING AND

02:46:48.765 --> 02:46:49.899
UNDERSCORES OUR SECTORS

02:46:49.966 --> 02:46:52.168
COMMITTED TO THIS. AND WE THINK

02:46:52.235 --> 02:46:53.403
THE RIGHT NOW IS EXACTLY THE

02:46:53.470 --> 02:46:54.904
WRONG TIME TO PULL THE TRIGGER

02:46:54.971 --> 02:46:56.773
ON CAT MORE TWO THOUSAND

02:46:56.840 --> 02:46:58.308
DOLLARS TO THE STUDENTS. WE

02:46:58.375 --> 02:47:00.276
BELIEVE THE BENEFIT OF YOU KNOW

02:47:00.343 --> 02:47:00.810
EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS IN

02:47:00.877 --> 02:47:02.445
SAVINGS BUT THIS WILL BE

02:47:02.512 --> 02:47:04.547
GENERATED BY THIS NOT FIFTY

02:47:04.614 --> 02:47:05.281
FIVE OR SO BILLION DOLLAR

02:47:05.348 --> 02:47:07.150
DEFICIT. ARE SIGNIFICANTLY

02:47:07.217 --> 02:47:08.284
OVERSHADOWED BY THE ADVERSE

02:47:08.351 --> 02:47:10.153
IMPACTS OF 11% CUT FOR THE

02:47:10.220 --> 02:47:12.822
STUDENTS- SO IN CLOSING I JUST

02:47:12.889 --> 02:47:14.124
SAY THAT WE APPRECIATE

02:47:14.190 --> 02:47:15.692
RECOGNISE THE SITUATION STATE

02:47:15.759 --> 02:47:17.494
FINDS ITSELF AND- RESPECTFULLY

02:47:17.560 --> 02:47:18.995
BELIEVE THAT THIS CATCH NOT BE

02:47:19.062 --> 02:47:22.732
IMPLEMENTED THIS YEAR- AND WE

02:47:22.799 --> 02:47:23.333
URGE YOU TO BE REJECTED. THANK

02:47:23.400 --> 02:47:24.601
YOU. THANK YOU FOR YOUR

02:47:24.667 --> 02:47:26.636
COMMENTS I JUST HAVE A COUPLE

02:47:26.703 --> 02:47:27.604
COMMENTS AND THEN I'LL TURN IT

02:47:27.670 --> 02:47:28.505
OVER TO MICHAEL ON THIS

02:47:28.571 --> 02:47:30.507
PARTICULAR ISSUE AND I'LL- TURN

02:47:30.573 --> 02:47:31.875
IT OVER TO MY COLLEAGUES I MEAN

02:47:31.941 --> 02:47:35.078
I. I HAVE TO SAY THAT GIVEN THE

02:47:35.145 --> 02:47:35.512
STRUCTURAL AND OTHER

02:47:35.578 --> 02:47:37.380
DIFFERENCES. BETWEEN THE

02:47:37.447 --> 02:47:39.883
NONPROFIT. PIRATE COMMUNITY AND

02:47:39.949 --> 02:47:43.052
OUR CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY

02:47:43.119 --> 02:47:45.221
AND UC I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY

02:47:45.288 --> 02:47:46.923
WE USE THE SAME PROGRAM AND

02:47:46.990 --> 02:47:49.359
APPLY THE SAME STANDARDS FOR

02:47:49.426 --> 02:47:50.393
INDEPENDENT COLLEGES AND

02:47:50.460 --> 02:47:53.296
UNIVERSITIES THAT WE USE FOR

02:47:53.363 --> 02:47:55.698
THE UC IN THE UC SYSTEM I MEAN

02:47:55.765 --> 02:47:58.935
THIS THIS CONCEPT OF ASSOCIATE

02:47:59.002 --> 02:47:59.736
DEGREE FOR TRANSFER AT

02:47:59.803 --> 02:48:03.807
STANDARD. BUT IT. THE CARD IS.

02:48:03.873 --> 02:48:04.340
TO HAVE A SYSTEM TO SYSTEM

02:48:04.407 --> 02:48:07.010
APPLICATION AS OPPOSED TO A

02:48:07.076 --> 02:48:08.845
SYSTEM TO AN INDIVIDUAL COLLEGE

02:48:08.912 --> 02:48:10.980
UNIVERSITY I WOULD SEEM TO ME

02:48:11.047 --> 02:48:11.681
IT WOULD BE VERY VERY

02:48:11.748 --> 02:48:13.750
DIFFICULT. TO IMPLEMENT THIS

02:48:13.817 --> 02:48:16.352
EFFECTIVELY ACROSS THE SECTOR

02:48:16.419 --> 02:48:18.188
WHEN YOU HAVE A SYSTEM IN THIS

02:48:31.835 --> 02:48:34.170
AN AVERAGE. I DON'T SEE WHY ANY

02:48:34.237 --> 02:48:35.839
PARTICULAR INDIVIDUAL COLLEGE

02:48:35.905 --> 02:48:38.041

YOU SEE. IT'S A VERY DIFFICULT

02:49:16.946 --> 02:49:19.616
STANDARD TO APPLY I THINK NOT

02:49:19.682 --> 02:49:22.785

02:50:02.525 --> 02:50:03.293
VARIATION DEPENDING WHICH

02:50:03.359 --> 02:50:05.094
