01:12:25.507 --> 01:12:26.975
INFLATE A LOCAL POPULATION

01:12:27.042 --> 01:12:29.845

DURING THE LAST REDISTRICTING

01:12:41.523 --> 01:12:42.858

01:12:42.925 --> 01:12:43.559
INCREDIBLY SUCCESSFUL AND

01:12:43.625 --> 01:12:46.562
IMPORTANT- AND TO KIND OF

01:12:46.628 --> 01:12:48.130

THOSE RESOURCES BECAUSE THEY

01:13:00.476 --> 01:13:02.077

01:13:02.144 --> 01:13:03.712
IN THAT SAME WAY BECAUSE OF OUR

01:13:03.779 --> 01:13:04.446
PRISONS ARE LOCATED THROUGHOUT

01:13:04.513 --> 01:13:06.315
