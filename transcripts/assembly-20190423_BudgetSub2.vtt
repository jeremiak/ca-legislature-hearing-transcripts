00:37:51.002 --> 00:37:52.937
GOOD MORNING MR TURN MEMBERS AT

ANALYST'S OFFICE.

00:37:54.438 --> 00:37:55.806
MOTOR COVER TWO ISSUES --

00:37:55.873 --> 00:37:57.174
RELATED TO PORTIONS HERE FIRST

00:37:57.241 --> 00:38:01.245
IS AN ISSUE THAT'S IN YOUR

00:38:01.312 --> 00:38:03.314
AGENDA WHICH IS RELATED TO A

00:38:03.381 --> 00:38:04.882
PENCIL SHORTFALL IN -- EIGHTEEN

00:38:04.949 --> 00:38:05.583
NINETEEN ANOTHER THERE ARE A

00:38:05.650 --> 00:38:06.484
COUPLE VERY ABLE ESTIMATES OF

00:38:06.550 --> 00:38:07.018
THE SHORTFALL BUT THIS IS

00:38:07.084 --> 00:38:08.686
SOMETHING THAT -- MAYBE A

00:38:08.753 --> 00:38:11.122
DECISION FOR YOU -- COME MAY --

00:38:11.188 --> 00:38:12.390
IF THE ADMINISTRATION IS NOT

00:38:12.456 --> 00:38:13.824
PROPOSED TO THE BACK WHAT

00:38:13.891 --> 00:38:15.626
SHORTFALL AT THE ME REVISION --

00:38:15.693 --> 00:38:16.994
WILL BE WHETHER OR NOT YOU ARE

00:38:17.061 --> 00:38:20.231
WANT TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL

00:38:20.297 --> 00:38:22.166
GENERAL FUND TO BACK FOR THAT.

00:38:22.233 --> 00:38:23.200
THE PROVIDING SOME FUNDING TO

00:38:23.267 --> 00:38:24.602
BAFFLE THAT SHORTFALL MIGHT BE --

00:38:24.669 --> 00:38:25.903
SOMETHING THAT WOULD HELP ENSURE

00:38:25.970 --> 00:38:27.238
THAT YOU'RE SINGLING SUPPORT FOR

00:38:27.304 --> 00:38:28.973
THE FUNDING FORMULA AND FOR THE

00:38:29.040 --> 00:38:29.607
CONCERNED WITH IMPROVING STUDENT

00:38:29.674 --> 00:38:30.541
OUTCOMES.

00:38:30.608 --> 00:38:31.842
BUT WE DO KNOW THAT THIS IS THE

00:38:31.909 --> 00:38:33.177
YEAR WHEN THERE ARE MORE LIMITED

00:38:33.244 --> 00:38:34.545
PROP AND YET RESOURCES AND THAT

00:38:34.612 --> 00:38:36.781
MIGHT NOT BE SOMETHING THAT IS --

00:38:36.847 --> 00:38:38.349
THAT IS FEASIBLE THIS YEAR I'M

00:38:38.416 --> 00:38:40.718
IF YOU DO -- DECIDE NOT TO BACK

00:38:40.785 --> 00:38:42.386
FOR THE SHORTFALL IN QUESTION

00:38:42.453 --> 00:38:44.221
WILL BE HOW THAT -- SHORTFALL IS

00:38:44.288 --> 00:38:46.290
DISTRIBUTED ACROSS THE STATE.

00:38:46.357 --> 00:38:47.158
AND THE CHANCES OFFICES HAVE

00:38:47.224 --> 00:38:49.093
INDICATED THEIR PREFERENCES TO

00:38:49.160 --> 00:38:50.494
ASSURE COLLEGES THAT THEY WOULD

00:38:50.561 --> 00:38:52.830
BE RECEIVING AT LEAST SEVENTY

00:38:52.897 --> 00:38:54.832
NINETEEN PLUS COLA -- SO THAT

00:38:54.899 --> 00:38:56.500
THERE IS SOME OF THE DISTRICT

00:38:56.567 --> 00:38:57.735
THAT DIDN'T GET AS MUCH UNDER

00:38:57.802 --> 00:38:58.836
THE NEW FUNDING FORMULA WOULDN'T

00:38:58.903 --> 00:39:01.105
TAKE -- MUCH OF THE THE CARD WE

00:39:01.172 --> 00:39:02.273
THINK THIS APPROACH -- SEEMS

00:39:02.339 --> 00:39:03.741
REASONABLE GIVEN THAT THERE WAS

00:39:03.808 --> 00:39:05.543
A PRETTY BIG VERY ABILITY AND

00:39:05.609 --> 00:39:10.581
THE YEAR TO YEAR INCREASES THAT

00:39:10.648 --> 00:39:11.215
DISTRICTS RECEIVED UNDER THE NEW

00:39:11.282 --> 00:39:12.950
FORMULA.

00:39:13.017 --> 00:39:13.684
I'M THE NEXT I WANTED TO TALK

00:39:13.751 --> 00:39:14.452
ABOUT THAT THE TWO PROPOSALS

00:39:14.518 --> 00:39:16.487
RELATED TO THE NINETEEN TWENTY A

00:39:16.554 --> 00:39:17.922
BUDGET AND AND OUR THAT'S BEEN A

00:39:17.988 --> 00:39:18.422
RECOMMENDATIONS HERE.

00:39:18.489 --> 00:39:19.390
I'M SO FIRST ON THE PROPOSAL TO

00:39:19.457 --> 00:39:21.358
DELAY THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE

00:39:21.425 --> 00:39:22.860
THE DELAY THE INCREASE IN THE

00:39:22.927 --> 00:39:24.595
STUDENT SUCCESS ALLOCATION -- WE

00:39:24.662 --> 00:39:26.263
DO THINK THAT IS A REASONABLE

00:39:26.330 --> 00:39:27.832
APPROACH -- WE DO THINK THAT

00:39:27.898 --> 00:39:29.567
THERE ARE SOME AT THE TO ISSUES

00:39:29.633 --> 00:39:31.368
FOR THE STATE TO WORK OUT -- WE

00:39:31.435 --> 00:39:33.370
HAVE A THERE'S A CHART ON PAGE

00:39:33.437 --> 00:39:34.739
SEVEN OF YOUR AGENDA THAT COMES

00:39:34.805 --> 00:39:36.841
FROM OUR ANALYSIS -- WHERE WE

00:39:36.907 --> 00:39:38.609
WERE LOOKING AT JUST THE LAST

00:39:38.676 --> 00:39:40.578
TEN YEARS OF -- THIS IS

00:39:40.644 --> 00:39:42.680
SPECIFICALLY ASSOCIATE DEGREES --

00:39:42.747 --> 00:39:45.549
AWARDED -- STATEWIDE AND AT

00:39:45.616 --> 00:39:46.717
VARIOUS COMMUNITY COLLEGE

00:39:46.784 --> 00:39:48.385
DISTRICTS ARE THE DATA LOOK

00:39:48.452 --> 00:39:48.986
SIMILAR IF YOU'RE LOOKING AT

00:39:49.053 --> 00:39:50.621
CERTIFICATES BUT WE DO SEE SOME

00:39:50.688 --> 00:39:52.456
SIGNIFICANT VARIATION FROM YEAR

00:39:52.523 --> 00:39:55.126
TO YEAR -- AND THERE THERE'S NOT

00:39:55.192 --> 00:39:57.328
A CLEAR EXACT ONE ANSWER FOR WHY

00:39:57.394 --> 00:39:58.829
THAT'S THE CASE -- WE DO THINK

00:39:58.896 --> 00:40:00.331
THAT ADDRESSING SOME OF THE

00:40:00.397 --> 00:40:02.600
CONCERNS OF A RELIABILITY

00:40:02.666 --> 00:40:03.801
ACCURACY OF THE DATA ARE

00:40:03.868 --> 00:40:05.436
IMPORTANT AND WE KNOW THAT THE

00:40:05.503 --> 00:40:07.171
CHANCES OFFICES INDICATED

00:40:07.238 --> 00:40:09.573
THEY'RE GONNA TAKE SEVERAL STEPS --

00:40:09.640 --> 00:40:11.108
TO TO ADDRESS THOSE ISSUES I'M

00:40:11.175 --> 00:40:12.176
IN TALKING TO SOME DISTRICTS ARE

00:40:12.243 --> 00:40:12.743
WE DO THINK THERE ARE SOME

00:40:12.810 --> 00:40:14.111
ADDITIONAL -- THERE MIGHT BE

00:40:14.178 --> 00:40:15.412
VERY VERY XIN IN THE STATE I

00:40:15.479 --> 00:40:17.481
EVEN IF YOU TO DEAL WITH SORT OF

00:40:17.548 --> 00:40:19.283
THE DATA RELIABILITY ISSUES.

00:40:19.350 --> 00:40:19.884
SOMETIMES YOU HAVE DISTRICTS

00:40:19.950 --> 00:40:21.185
GOING THROUGH SPECIFIC LOCAL

00:40:21.252 --> 00:40:24.054
ISSUES LIKE CHANGES IN IN THE

00:40:24.121 --> 00:40:26.457
LOCAL ECONOMY OR CHANGES THEN

00:40:26.524 --> 00:40:28.425
FOR EXAMPLE -- THE NUMBER OF

00:40:28.492 --> 00:40:29.827
TRANSFER STUDENTS ARE ADMITTED

00:40:29.894 --> 00:40:30.928
BY US YES USE IN THEIR LOCAL

00:40:30.995 --> 00:40:33.230
AREA THAT CAN SIGNIFICANTLY

00:40:33.297 --> 00:40:33.931
AFFECT THEIR YOUR TO YOUR

00:40:33.998 --> 00:40:35.666
OUTCOMES -- SO WE WOULD

00:40:35.733 --> 00:40:37.601
RECOMMEND THAT YOU -- IT CHANGE

00:40:37.668 --> 00:40:38.435
THE THING SIX ALLOCATION SO THAT

00:40:38.502 --> 00:40:40.838
RATHER THAN BEING DRIVEN BY ONE

00:40:40.905 --> 00:40:42.239
YEAR'S WORTH ROCKING DATA IT'S A

00:40:42.306 --> 00:40:43.474
THREE YEAR ROLLING AVERAGE.

00:40:43.541 --> 00:40:44.275
THAT WOULD ALSO MAKE IT

00:40:44.341 --> 00:40:45.142
CONSISTENT WITH THE BASE

00:40:45.209 --> 00:40:46.777
ALLOCATION WHICH IS DISTRIBUTED

00:40:46.844 --> 00:40:53.951
BASED ON A THREE YEAR ROLLING

00:40:54.018 --> 00:40:54.785
AVERAGE OF ENROLLMENT.

00:40:54.852 --> 00:40:55.719
THAT WE THINK WILL HELP WITH

00:40:55.786 --> 00:40:57.154
STABILITY FOR BOTH -- DISTRICTS

00:40:57.221 --> 00:40:58.355
BUT ALSO FOR THE STATE AND

00:40:58.422 --> 00:40:59.190
PROJECTING WITH A FUNDING WILL

00:40:59.256 --> 00:41:00.724
BE IN THE FUTURE.

00:41:00.791 --> 00:41:01.759
I'M ON THE SECOND ISSUE THAT

00:41:01.826 --> 00:41:02.726
THERE ARE SECOND PROPOSAL THAT

00:41:02.793 --> 00:41:03.327
THE ADMINISTRATION HAS RELATED

00:41:03.394 --> 00:41:05.863
TO ARE PUTTING A 10% CAP ON THE

00:41:05.930 --> 00:41:06.397
YEAR TO YEAR GROWTH IN THE

00:41:06.463 --> 00:41:06.897
STUDENT SUCCESS OKAY.

00:41:06.964 --> 00:41:07.865
WE DO RECOMMEND REJECTING THAT

00:41:07.932 --> 00:41:08.933
PROPOSAL I'M MORE CONCERNED THAT

00:41:08.999 --> 00:41:10.868
IS IT WE APPRECIATE THE CONCERN

00:41:10.935 --> 00:41:12.069
ABOUT CONTAINING COSTS IN THE

00:41:12.136 --> 00:41:13.270
FORMULA BUT WE ARE CONCERNED

00:41:13.337 --> 00:41:14.605
THAT THAT APPROACH.

00:41:14.672 --> 00:41:15.472
IS THAT COULD APPROACH THAT

00:41:15.539 --> 00:41:16.974
COULD REDUCE FINANCIAL

00:41:17.041 --> 00:41:17.908
INCENTIVES FOR SOME DISTRICTS

00:41:17.975 --> 00:41:19.743
ARE ACTUALLY MAKING NOTABLE

00:41:19.810 --> 00:41:21.111
IMPROVEMENTS IN STUDENT OUTCOMES.

00:41:21.178 --> 00:41:22.646
AND SO WE WOULD RECOMMEND

00:41:22.713 --> 00:41:24.748
CONSIDERING OTHER ALTERNATIVES --

00:41:24.815 --> 00:41:26.217
THAT WOULD CONTINUE TO HAVE

00:41:26.283 --> 00:41:27.618
STRONG INCENTIVES FOR DISTRICTS

00:41:27.685 --> 00:41:29.086
TO IMPROVE OUTCOMES WHILE AT THE

00:41:29.153 --> 00:41:30.921
SAME TIME -- CONTROLLING COSTS

00:41:30.988 --> 00:41:32.790
AND AVOIDING SOME OF THE SORT OF

00:41:32.857 --> 00:41:34.291
NEGATIVE INSTANCES WE MIGHT BE

00:41:34.358 --> 00:41:35.593
CONCERNED ABOUT -- ONE

00:41:35.659 --> 00:41:37.761
PARTICULAR -- THEIR NUMBER OF

00:41:37.828 --> 00:41:38.696
WAYS THAT YOU COULD DO THIS THE

00:41:38.762 --> 00:41:40.030
ONE SPECIFIC OPERA SO WE

00:41:40.097 --> 00:41:41.799
RECOMMEND IS TO LIMIT THE AMOUNT

00:41:41.866 --> 00:41:43.367
OF OUTCOME BASED FUNDING THAT

00:41:43.434 --> 00:41:44.635
COMES FROM.

00:41:44.702 --> 00:41:45.936
THE COME FROM ANY INDIVIDUAL

00:41:46.003 --> 00:41:47.838
STUDENT IN ANY YEAR -- SO FOR

00:41:47.905 --> 00:41:49.039
EXAMPLE STUDENT WHO EARNED AN

00:41:49.106 --> 00:41:51.208
ASSOCIATE DEGREE -- AND THE

00:41:51.275 --> 00:41:53.310
CERTIFICATE THE DISTRICT ONLY

00:41:53.377 --> 00:41:53.944
GET FUNDING FOR THAT ASSOCIATE

00:41:54.011 --> 00:41:55.212
DEGREE AND WE THINK THAT THE

00:41:55.279 --> 00:41:57.815
APPROACH THAT -- CONTINUES TO

00:41:57.882 --> 00:41:58.849
STILL GIVE DISTRICT INCENTIVES

00:41:58.916 --> 00:42:00.718
TO IMPROVE OUTCOMES TO IMPROVE

00:42:00.784 --> 00:42:02.186
STUDENT SUCCESS WILL REMOVE THAT

00:42:02.253 --> 00:42:03.220
NEGATIVE INCENTIVE TO SORT OF

00:42:03.287 --> 00:42:04.188
TAKE STUDENTS WHO ARE ALREADY

00:42:04.255 --> 00:42:05.189
COMPLETING ADDING AND

00:42:05.256 --> 00:42:06.690
ENCOURAGING THEM TO TAKE

00:42:06.757 --> 00:42:08.592
ADDITIONAL CERTIFICATES.

00:42:08.659 --> 00:42:09.326
I WOULD THINK THAT APPROACH

00:42:09.393 --> 00:42:10.928
WOULD WOULD REDUCE COSTS IN A

00:42:10.995 --> 00:42:12.263
WAY THAT I STILL HAVE STRONG

00:42:12.329 --> 00:42:18.469
INCENTIVES FOR IMPROVING STUDENT

00:42:18.535 --> 00:42:21.005
SUCCESS MORE BROADLY.

00:42:21.071 --> 00:42:22.439
I'M SO STOPPED THERE AND I'M

00:42:22.506 --> 00:42:25.643
HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS.

00:42:25.709 --> 00:42:26.777
CHRISTIAN LAST MINUTE WITH THE

00:42:26.844 --> 00:42:27.878
CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES

00:42:27.945 --> 00:42:29.179
CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE -- I'M GONNA

00:42:29.246 --> 00:42:31.515
BE WORKING OFF OF THIS HANDOUT --

00:42:31.582 --> 00:42:33.717
IT'LL START ON PAGE TWO MUCH OF

00:42:33.784 --> 00:42:34.551
WHAT.

00:42:34.618 --> 00:42:35.753
WE INCLUDING THE HEAD OUT HIS

00:42:35.819 --> 00:42:36.854
BEEN COVERED BY -- SOME OF THE

00:42:36.921 --> 00:42:37.488
OTHER PANELISTS SO I WILL MOVE

00:42:37.554 --> 00:42:38.722
QUICKLY -- BUT ON THE TOP OF

00:42:38.789 --> 00:42:41.025
PAGE TWO I WOULD JUST NOTE THAT

00:42:41.091 --> 00:42:42.760
AS WE PROPOSED CHANGES TO THE

00:42:42.826 --> 00:42:43.460
FUNDING FORMULA LAST YEAR AND AS

00:42:43.527 --> 00:42:44.528
WE CONTINUE TO IMPLEMENT AND

00:42:44.595 --> 00:42:45.863
THINK THROUGH -- POTENTIAL

00:42:45.930 --> 00:42:46.931
AMENDMENTS TO THE FORMULA WE'RE

00:42:46.997 --> 00:42:48.499
GUIDED BY A SET OF THREE

00:42:48.565 --> 00:42:50.200
PRINCIPLES ONE THE GOAL OF

00:42:50.267 --> 00:42:51.702
ENCOURAGING PROGRESS TOWARDS THE

00:42:51.769 --> 00:42:53.203
VISION FOR SUCCESS WHICH HAS A

00:42:53.270 --> 00:42:54.738
NORTH STAR.

00:42:54.805 --> 00:42:56.941
OF CLOSING ACHIEVEMENT GAPS --

00:42:57.007 --> 00:42:58.175
EQUITY GAPS IN STUDENT OUTCOMES

00:42:58.242 --> 00:43:00.477
BY TWENTY TWENTY FIVE SECOND TO

00:43:00.544 --> 00:43:02.446
PROVIDE STUDENTS WHO HAVE FACED

00:43:02.513 --> 00:43:05.015
ADDITIONAL BARRIERS TO SUCCESS.

00:43:05.082 --> 00:43:06.116
PRINCIPALLY.

00:43:06.183 --> 00:43:07.618
STUDENTS FROM LOW SOCIO ECONOMIC

00:43:07.685 --> 00:43:09.286
BACKGROUNDS WITH ADDITIONAL

00:43:09.353 --> 00:43:10.754
SUPPORT TO MEET THE GOALS AND

00:43:10.821 --> 00:43:12.523
THIRD TO MAKE THESE RESOURCES

00:43:12.589 --> 00:43:14.224
FLEXIBLE AND PREDICTABLE -- AT

00:43:14.291 --> 00:43:16.360
THE BOTTOM OF PAGE TWO HAS THE

00:43:16.427 --> 00:43:17.761
STRUCTURE OF THE FORMULA THAT'S

00:43:17.828 --> 00:43:19.697
BEEN COVERED SO I MOVED TO THE

00:43:19.763 --> 00:43:21.665
TOP OF PAGE.

00:43:21.732 --> 00:43:22.166
THREE AND JUST.

00:43:22.232 --> 00:43:23.734
THE AGENDA NOTED SOME OF THE

00:43:23.801 --> 00:43:25.970
CONCERNS AROUND THE RELATIVE

00:43:26.036 --> 00:43:27.771
DISTRIBUTION OF POINTS UNDER THE

00:43:27.838 --> 00:43:28.706
FORMULA.

00:43:28.772 --> 00:43:30.774
SO I THINK YOU CAN AND FOR THREE

00:43:30.841 --> 00:43:32.509
DIFFERENT WAYS IN WHICH THE THE

00:43:32.576 --> 00:43:34.745
POINTS WERE DESIGNED FIRST --

00:43:34.812 --> 00:43:35.646
PARTICULARLY AS PART OF THE

00:43:35.713 --> 00:43:37.915
STUDENT SUCCESS ALLOCATION FIRST --

00:43:37.982 --> 00:43:40.751
DIFFERENCES IN COST BASED ON

00:43:40.818 --> 00:43:42.086
DIFFERENCES OF LIKE THE PROGRAM.

00:43:42.152 --> 00:43:44.688
SECOND OF THE ADDED COSTS THE

00:43:44.755 --> 00:43:46.757
DISTRICT MIGHT INCUR TOWARDS

00:43:46.824 --> 00:43:48.292
INCREMENTAL PROGRESS TOWARD NOW

00:43:48.359 --> 00:43:49.193
COME.

00:43:49.259 --> 00:43:50.661
IN THIRD A CLEAR INTENT TO

00:43:50.728 --> 00:43:51.929
CREATE FINANCIAL INCENTIVES

00:43:51.996 --> 00:43:53.297
AROUND PARTICULAR OUTCOMES I

00:43:53.364 --> 00:43:54.932
THINK THIS IS MOST PROMINENT --

00:43:54.999 --> 00:43:56.133
IN THE ADDITIONAL POINTS THAT

00:43:56.200 --> 00:43:58.902
ARE AWARDED FOR A COMPLETION OF

00:43:58.969 --> 00:44:00.204
AN ASSOCIATE DEGREE FOR TRANSFER.

00:44:00.270 --> 00:44:02.406
AT THE BOTTOM OF PAGE -- THREE I

00:44:02.473 --> 00:44:03.540
WOULD JUST KNOW WE HAVEN'T

00:44:03.607 --> 00:44:05.142
TALKED YET ABOUT THE FUNDING

00:44:05.209 --> 00:44:07.244
STABILITY PROVISIONS CLEARLY A A

00:44:07.311 --> 00:44:10.047
GOAL OF THIS FORMULA WAS TO MAKE

00:44:10.114 --> 00:44:11.815
OVER TIME -- COMMUNITY COLLEGE

00:44:11.882 --> 00:44:13.417
FUNDING MORE STABLE -- THE

00:44:13.484 --> 00:44:15.386
FORMULA INCLUDES A SET OF TESTS

00:44:15.452 --> 00:44:17.521
THAT DEFINE HOW MUCH A DISTRICT

00:44:17.588 --> 00:44:21.091
WOULD RECEIVE IN A GIVEN YEAR

00:44:21.158 --> 00:44:21.725
FOR TWENTY EIGHTEEN NINETEEN TO

00:44:21.792 --> 00:44:22.359
DISTRICT AS THE THE LEGISLATIVE

00:44:22.426 --> 00:44:23.594
ANALYST'S OFFICE IS NOTED.

00:44:23.660 --> 00:44:26.597
WOULD RECEIVE AT LEAST THERE

00:44:26.663 --> 00:44:27.197
TWENTY SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN READ

00:44:27.264 --> 00:44:28.599
REVENUES ADJUSTED BY THE CHANGES

00:44:28.665 --> 00:44:33.337
IN THE COST OF LIVING IN.

00:44:33.404 --> 00:44:33.837
TWENTY EIGHTEEN NINETEEN

00:44:33.904 --> 00:44:34.705
BEGINNING IN TWENTY NINETEEN

00:44:34.772 --> 00:44:35.305
TWENTY WE SEE IT SORT OF TEST

00:44:35.372 --> 00:44:36.140
THAT COMPARE WHAT A DISTRICT

00:44:36.206 --> 00:44:37.274
WOULD HAVE RECEIVED.

00:44:37.341 --> 00:44:38.742
UNDER THE STUDENT CENTER FUNDING

00:44:38.809 --> 00:44:40.644
FORMULA IN THE CURRENT YEAR WITH

00:44:40.711 --> 00:44:41.278
WHAT THEY WOULD RECEIVE IN THE

00:44:41.345 --> 00:44:43.747
PRIOR YEAR AND WE FUND THEM AT

00:44:43.814 --> 00:44:45.549
LEAST AT THE HIGHER OF THE TWO

00:44:45.616 --> 00:44:47.284
MOVING ON TO PAGE FOUR I WOULD

00:44:47.351 --> 00:44:48.452
JUST KNOW WHEN WE TALK ABOUT A

00:44:48.519 --> 00:44:51.221
SPLIT OF SEVENTY TWENTY TEN WHAT.

00:44:51.288 --> 00:44:52.656
WE'RE SUGGESTING IS THAT THE

00:44:52.723 --> 00:44:54.491
BASE ALLOCATION WOULD REPRESENT

00:44:54.558 --> 00:44:56.760
STATEWIDE ABOUT 70% OF FUNDING

00:44:56.827 --> 00:44:59.129
THE SUPPLEMENTAL ALLOCATION 20%

00:44:59.196 --> 00:45:00.697
THE STUDENT SUCCESS ALLOCATION

00:45:00.764 --> 00:45:03.767
10% -- BASED ON OUR MOST RECENT

00:45:03.834 --> 00:45:05.169
ESTIMATE OF COSTS OF THE FUNDING

00:45:05.235 --> 00:45:07.171
FORMULA IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN

00:45:07.237 --> 00:45:08.405
NINETEEN THAT'S GENERALLY WHAT

00:45:08.472 --> 00:45:10.374
YOU SEE SIGNIFICANT RESOURCES

00:45:10.441 --> 00:45:12.009
OUTPUT ALLOCATED TOWARDS THE

00:45:12.076 --> 00:45:15.045
BASE ALLOCATION -- AND THAT THE

00:45:15.112 --> 00:45:16.980
SHARES DECLINING RAPIDLY BEYOND

00:45:17.047 --> 00:45:17.781
THAT.

00:45:17.848 --> 00:45:19.149
I ALSO WANTED TO NOTE AT THE

00:45:19.216 --> 00:45:20.551
BOTTOM OF PAGE -- FOR WITH THE

00:45:20.617 --> 00:45:22.219
LEGISLATURE AND GOVERNOR ENACTED

00:45:22.286 --> 00:45:23.787
THE FUNDING FOR THE LAST YEAR.

00:45:23.854 --> 00:45:26.156
OF THE INCLUDED PROVISIONS

00:45:26.223 --> 00:45:28.659
AROUND LOCAL GOAL SETTING

00:45:28.725 --> 00:45:30.694
PLANNING AND AND BUDGETING WITH

00:45:30.761 --> 00:45:32.629
THE INTENT THAT DISTRICTS AND

00:45:32.696 --> 00:45:33.797
THINKING ABOUT HOW TO RESPOND TO

00:45:33.864 --> 00:45:34.798
THE NEW INCENTIVES.

00:45:34.865 --> 00:45:35.999
ARE HAVING A SET OF

00:45:36.066 --> 00:45:37.334
CONVERSATIONS WITH THEIR

00:45:37.401 --> 00:45:39.036
COMMUNITIES ABOUT.

00:45:39.103 --> 00:45:41.038
HOW THOSE DOLLARS WOULD BE USED

00:45:41.105 --> 00:45:42.272
TO SUPPORT ACHIEVEMENT OF THE

00:45:42.339 --> 00:45:44.274
VISION FOR SUCCESS SPECIFICALLY

00:45:44.341 --> 00:45:46.143
THE DISTRICTS ARE REQUIRED BY

00:45:46.210 --> 00:45:47.511
THE END OF THIS YEAR THIS

00:45:47.578 --> 00:45:49.346
ACADEMIC YEAR? TO ADOPT GOALS

00:45:49.413 --> 00:45:50.481
THAT ARE ALLIED WITH THE VISION

00:45:50.547 --> 00:45:52.349
FOR SUCCESS MOVING FORWARD WE

00:45:52.416 --> 00:45:54.218
EXPECT AVOID OP COMPREHENSIVE

00:45:54.284 --> 00:45:55.786
PLANS EDUCATIONAL PLANTS THAT

00:45:55.853 --> 00:45:56.820
ALLIED WITH THOSE GOALS AND

00:45:56.887 --> 00:46:00.190
OTHER BUDGETS WOULD BE ALLIED

00:46:00.257 --> 00:46:01.458
WITH THOSE COMPREHENSIVE PLANS.

00:46:01.525 --> 00:46:02.693
I'M GOING TO MOVE TO THE BOTTOM

00:46:02.759 --> 00:46:05.162
OF PAGE FIVE AS THE LEGISLATIVE

00:46:05.229 --> 00:46:08.499
ANALYST'S NOTE -- NOTES -- AS OF

00:46:08.565 --> 00:46:10.701
OUR MOST RECENT ESTIMATES OF THE

00:46:10.767 --> 00:46:12.603
COST OF THE FORMULA -- THE KERN

00:46:12.669 --> 00:46:13.937
APPROPRIATIONS FOR THE CURRENT

00:46:14.004 --> 00:46:16.206
FISCAL YEAR.

00:46:16.273 --> 00:46:16.773
TWENTY EIGHTEEN NINETEEN ARE

00:46:16.840 --> 00:46:18.108
INSUFFICIENT TO COVER THE COST

00:46:18.175 --> 00:46:19.610
OF THE FORMULA THERE'S TWO

00:46:19.676 --> 00:46:21.979
PRINCIPAL REASONS THE TOTAL --

00:46:22.045 --> 00:46:23.380
DIFFERENCE SAID AVAILABLE

00:46:23.447 --> 00:46:28.919
RESOURCES IS -- THREE HUNDRED

00:46:28.986 --> 00:46:29.987
TWENTY FOUR IN DOLLARS -- THE

00:46:30.053 --> 00:46:32.089
DIFFERENCE IS -- OR IN TWO PARTS

00:46:32.156 --> 00:46:33.757
ONE OF THE HIGHER COSTS OF THE

00:46:33.824 --> 00:46:36.226
FORMULA OF ABOUT A HUNDRED FORTY

00:46:36.293 --> 00:46:37.194
THREE MILLION DOLLARS COMPARED

00:46:37.261 --> 00:46:39.363
TO WHAT WAS ESTIMATED WHAT THE

00:46:39.429 --> 00:46:40.764
BUDGET WAS ENACTED IN SHARED.

00:46:40.831 --> 00:46:43.000
THIS LARGELY HAS TO DEAL WITH

00:46:43.066 --> 00:46:45.002
BOTH INCREASES IN THE COST OF

00:46:45.068 --> 00:46:46.970
THE STUDENT SUCCESS ALLOCATION

00:46:47.037 --> 00:46:48.906
ASSOCIATED WITH HIGHER THAN

00:46:48.972 --> 00:46:50.674
PROJECTED OUTCOMES A STUDENT

00:46:50.741 --> 00:46:51.375
OUTCOMES.

00:46:51.441 --> 00:46:53.143
AS WELL AS INCREASES IN THE COST

00:46:53.210 --> 00:46:54.444
OF THE HOLD HARMLESS THE

00:52:56.206 --> 00:52:57.541
PRACTICE OF THE PAST THIRTY

00:52:57.607 --> 00:52:59.609
YEARS HAS BEEN TO FIND COMMUNITY

00:52:59.676 --> 00:53:01.044
COLLEGES CONSISTENT WITH THE

00:53:01.111 --> 00:53:02.979
MINIMUM GUARANTEE SO WE WE

00:53:03.046 --> 00:53:04.981
RECOGNIZE THAT'S THE REALITY

00:53:05.048 --> 00:53:07.317
THAT WE ARE -- PLAYING IN A

00:53:07.384 --> 00:53:13.924
FIXED -- A LOT OF FUN SO I THINK --

00:53:13.990 --> 00:53:15.025
YOU KNOW.

00:53:15.091 --> 00:53:15.659
IN TALKING WITH FOLKS THROUGHOUT

00:53:15.725 --> 00:53:16.259
THE SYSTEM I THINK THERE IS A

00:53:16.326 --> 00:53:16.860
<u>&lt;c.green&gt;LEAR MESSAGE THAT WE NEED TO&lt;/c&gt;</u>

00:53:16.927 --> 00:53:17.460
HAVE A MUCH STRONGER MESSAGE

00:53:17.527 --> 00:53:18.328
THAT THE MINIMUM GUARANTEE IS

00:53:18.395 --> 00:53:18.828
INSUFFICIENT TO MEET THE

00:53:18.895 --> 00:53:19.329
RESOURCES.

00:53:19.396 --> 00:53:20.130
OF THE RESOURCE NEEDS OF THE

00:53:20.196 --> 00:53:21.598
COLLEGES BUT IT BUT YES I THINK

00:53:21.665 --> 00:53:24.067
ULTIMATELY -- AT THE REQUEST AS

00:53:24.134 --> 00:53:26.102
THE STATE SHOULD BACK FILL OUT

00:53:26.169 --> 00:53:27.837
WHATEVER THE FORMULA COSTS AND

00:53:27.904 --> 00:53:29.639
MOVING FORWARD WE SHOULD

00:53:29.706 --> 00:53:30.273
IDENTIFY.

00:53:30.340 --> 00:53:32.676
HOW TO ADJUST THE FORMULA TO FIT

00:53:32.742 --> 00:53:34.544
WITHIN THE RESOURCE NEEDS THAT

00:53:34.611 --> 00:53:36.613
ARE -- REASONABLE FOR THE STATE

00:53:36.680 --> 00:53:38.648
TO PROVIDE.

00:53:38.715 --> 00:53:40.116
THE RESOURCE IS MAYBE NOT EVEN

00:53:40.183 --> 00:53:41.718
THE RESOURCE -- I WOULD SAY THE

00:53:41.785 --> 00:53:43.587
RESOURCES BECAUSE THE NEED IS

00:53:43.653 --> 00:53:44.754
GREATER THAN OR ALLOCATING AYE

00:53:44.821 --> 00:53:46.556
AYE I CONCEDE THAT OUT OF THE

00:53:46.623 --> 00:53:47.357
GATE BUT GIVEN THE CONFINES WE

00:53:47.424 --> 00:53:47.924
HAVE WITH.

00:53:47.991 --> 00:53:49.659
K. FOURTEEN PROP NINETY EIGHT

00:53:49.726 --> 00:53:51.494
THAT THIS LEGISLATURE CHOOSES TO

00:53:51.561 --> 00:53:53.630
MAKE IT A CEILING AS OPPOSED TO

00:53:53.697 --> 00:53:54.397
A FLOOR.

00:53:54.464 --> 00:53:55.599
AND THAT'S OUR DECISION AND I

00:53:55.665 --> 00:53:56.232
THINK IT'S UNFORTUNATE IT'S NOT

00:53:56.299 --> 00:53:58.001
ON AYE SUPPORT BUT IT IS IT IS A

00:53:58.068 --> 00:53:58.802
FACT.

00:53:58.868 --> 00:54:01.438
THAT THE DYNAMIC WE LIVE IN --

00:54:01.504 --> 00:54:02.572
FOR THE JOB IN FOR A SECOND --

00:54:02.639 --> 00:54:04.407
WE WE THINK THAT THE THAT THERE

00:54:04.474 --> 00:54:06.209
ARE A FEW EXPLANATIONS FOR THE

00:54:06.276 --> 00:54:07.644
CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE REPORTED

00:54:07.711 --> 00:54:09.179
CURRENT YEAR APPORTIONMENT

00:54:09.245 --> 00:54:14.017
SHORTFALL -- WITH.

00:54:14.084 --> 00:54:14.584
HISTORICAL TRENDS IN RECENT

00:54:14.651 --> 00:54:15.685
YEARS -- YOU CAN SEE THAT AT

00:54:15.752 --> 00:54:16.252
THIS POINT IN TIME THE THE

00:54:16.319 --> 00:54:17.320
CHANCELLR'S OFFICE PROPERTY

00:54:17.387 --> 00:54:18.622
TAXES HAVE BEEN.

00:54:18.688 --> 00:54:20.390
UNDER REPORTED IN THE LAST FEW

00:54:20.457 --> 00:54:21.725
YEARS THAT THE P. ONE POINT IN

00:54:21.791 --> 00:54:23.660
TIME AND THAT'S LARGELY RELATED

00:54:23.727 --> 00:54:25.261
TO WHEN PROPERTY TAXES ARE

00:54:25.328 --> 00:54:28.031
COLLECTED -- FOR P. ONE AND THE

00:54:28.098 --> 00:54:30.333
LAST THREE YEARS -- PROPERTY

00:54:30.400 --> 00:54:31.701
TAXES HAVE BEEN.

00:54:31.768 --> 00:54:34.270
UNDER REPORTED BY YOU KNOW CLOSE

00:54:34.337 --> 00:54:35.138
TO A HUNDRED AND EIGHTY MILLION

00:54:35.205 --> 00:54:37.173
IN THE LAST THREE YEARS AND WE

00:54:37.240 --> 00:54:39.576
ALSO THINK THAT THERE ARE SOME.

00:54:39.643 --> 00:54:42.379
OTHER EXPLANATION SUCH AS THE IN

00:54:42.445 --> 00:54:43.513
THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE

00:54:43.580 --> 00:54:45.715
CALCULATION OF EXPENDITURES FOR

00:54:45.782 --> 00:54:47.417
THEIR CURRENT YEAR SHORTFALL WE

00:54:47.484 --> 00:54:48.785
THINK THERE'S SOME OVERSTATING

00:54:48.852 --> 00:54:52.555
OF EXPENDITURES INCLUDING -- A

00:54:52.622 --> 00:54:54.124
MISCALCULATION OF THAT THREE

00:54:54.190 --> 00:54:55.392
YEAR AVERAGE FOR THE BASE

00:54:55.458 --> 00:54:56.760
ALLOCATION OF THE FUNDING

00:54:56.826 --> 00:55:01.097
FORMULA -- AND THE THE

00:55:01.164 --> 00:55:03.667
CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE ALSO.

00:55:03.733 --> 00:55:05.135
IT USES A DEFINITION OF

00:55:05.201 --> 00:55:06.403
TRANSFERS THAT DOES NOT ALIGN

00:55:06.469 --> 00:55:07.437
WITH THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET

00:55:07.504 --> 00:55:09.506
PROPOSAL TO ACCOUNT FOR AND

00:55:09.572 --> 00:55:11.841
DUPLICATED TRANSFERS AND SO FOR

00:55:11.908 --> 00:55:12.642
A LOT OF DIFFERENT REASONS WE

00:55:12.709 --> 00:55:15.612
THINK -- THAT THE REPORTED

00:55:15.679 --> 00:55:18.048
SHORTFALL IN THE CURRENT YEAR IS

00:55:18.114 --> 00:55:20.383
IS NOT AS GREAT AS IS.

00:55:20.450 --> 00:55:22.052
CURRENTLY BEING STATED SO WOULD

00:55:22.118 --> 00:55:24.521
WE FIX THIS WHERE WOULD WE

00:55:24.587 --> 00:55:27.357
ADDRESS THAT IN THE BUDGET.

00:55:27.424 --> 00:55:29.292
YEAH RIGHT NOW WE ARE -- ME THE

00:55:29.359 --> 00:55:30.994
ART OF DANCE IS A LOT OF SWAY

00:55:31.061 --> 00:55:31.861
HER SOMEONE EARNED.

00:55:31.928 --> 00:55:32.462
RIGHT NOW WE'RE JUST TALKING

00:55:32.529 --> 00:55:33.329
ABOUT HOW DO WE GET TO A

00:55:33.396 --> 00:55:35.298
SOLUTION SO THAT THEY DON'T DO

00:55:35.365 --> 00:55:36.399
THAT AGAIN IF IN FACT THEY ARE

00:55:36.466 --> 00:55:37.333
DOING AND MISSING YOUR DOING

00:55:37.400 --> 00:55:39.502
THAT BUT IF THAT'S HAPPENING.

00:55:39.569 --> 00:55:40.503
THERE'S ACCOUNTING.

00:55:40.570 --> 00:55:41.838
YEAH WE WERE UPDATING

00:55:41.905 --> 00:55:43.907
EXPENDITURES AS WE ARE A LEADING

00:55:43.973 --> 00:55:45.341
UP TO THE MAY REVISION WHICH IS

00:55:45.408 --> 00:55:46.543
THIS COMING UP VERY SOON WORK

00:55:46.609 --> 00:55:48.011
WE'RE GOING TO BE RECEIVING.

00:55:48.078 --> 00:55:50.113
UPDATED REVENUES SO WE ARE

00:55:50.180 --> 00:55:52.716
MONITORING YOU KNOW THIS THE

00:55:52.782 --> 00:55:57.353
SITUATION VERY CLOSELY -- OKAY.

00:55:57.420 --> 00:56:00.090
THE DIED IN DID YOU WANT TO ADD

00:56:00.156 --> 00:56:00.390
SOMETHING.

00:56:00.457 --> 00:56:01.558
I'M RICHARD HE THOUGHT THE

00:56:01.624 --> 00:56:02.158
DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE I WOULD

00:56:02.225 --> 00:56:02.726
JUST NOTE THAT WE'RE WORKING

00:56:02.792 --> 00:56:03.727
CLOSELY TO BETTER UNDERSTAND THE

00:56:03.793 --> 00:56:05.528
DATA WE HAVE UPDATED DATE AT

00:56:05.595 --> 00:56:06.129
THAT WE RECEIVE AT THE MERE

00:56:06.196 --> 00:56:06.730
VISION.

00:56:06.796 --> 00:56:07.764
AND TYPICALLY WHEN THERE ARE

00:56:07.831 --> 00:56:10.166
SHIPS AND PROPERTY TAX REVENUES

00:56:10.233 --> 00:56:13.002
AT THE ME REVISION -- A FINANCE

00:56:13.069 --> 00:56:14.938
PROPOSES THAT MAKES A FINE SO

00:56:15.004 --> 00:56:16.072
WE'RE LOOKING AT THE DATA THAT

00:56:16.139 --> 00:56:17.807
THE MAY REVISED MAY ADDRESS THE

00:56:17.874 --> 00:56:19.342
SITUATION BECAUSE I YEAH I HAVE

00:56:19.409 --> 00:56:21.177
A CHALLENGE OF THE YOU KNOW.

00:56:21.244 --> 00:56:22.045
THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE COME EVER

00:56:22.112 --> 00:56:22.579
SAY LOOK WE HAVE THIS BIG

00:56:22.645 --> 00:56:23.213
SHORTFALL AND THEN YOU GUYS A

00:56:23.279 --> 00:56:24.814
WAY MAYBE THEY DON'T I JUST HOPE

00:56:24.881 --> 00:56:26.182
THIS WILL BE WORKED OUT PRIOR TO

00:56:26.249 --> 00:56:28.084
THIS HEARING GOING FORWARD

00:56:28.151 --> 00:56:28.852
THAT'S JUST MY TAKE.

00:56:28.918 --> 00:56:31.888
BUT EITHER WAY -- THANK YOU AND

00:56:31.955 --> 00:56:33.757
I JUST COUPLE OTHER -- OF

00:56:33.823 --> 00:56:34.724
THOUGHTS QUESTIONS YOU KNOW WITH

00:56:34.791 --> 00:56:35.959
REGARD TO THE CURRENT FUNDING

00:56:36.025 --> 00:56:38.161
FORMULA IS IT IS UNPREDICTABLE.

00:56:38.228 --> 00:56:39.662
IT BOUNCES TOO MUCH I THINK WE

00:56:39.729 --> 00:56:40.964
NEED TO LOOK AT THAT IT'S

00:56:41.030 --> 00:56:44.634
COMPLEX TO IMPLEMENT -- IT EVEN

00:56:44.701 --> 00:56:45.635
THE LA -- SAYS IT COULD

00:56:45.702 --> 00:56:47.370
FLUCTUATE GREATLY FROM ONE YEAR

00:56:47.437 --> 00:56:49.005
TO ANOTHER SO I THINK WE NEED TO

00:56:49.072 --> 00:56:50.140
LOOK AT THAT AS YOU AS YOU

00:56:50.206 --> 00:56:51.741
CONTEMPLATE SOME CHANGES. TO THE

00:56:51.808 --> 00:56:53.309
FUNDING FORMULA AND THE STUDENT

00:56:53.376 --> 00:56:58.782
SUCCESS MEASURES CONCERN ME

00:56:58.848 --> 00:57:00.750
GREATLY BECAUSE THE USE IT

00:57:00.817 --> 00:57:02.185
STUDENT WHO TRANSFERS TO UC

00:57:02.252 --> 00:57:03.119
GENERATES LESS FUNDING THAN A

00:57:03.186 --> 00:57:04.020
TRANSFER TO A CSU BECAUSE THAT

00:57:04.087 --> 00:57:04.754
ASSOCIATES.

00:57:04.821 --> 00:57:05.722
DEGREE REQUIREMENT WHICH IS

00:57:05.789 --> 00:57:07.190
SOMETHING THAT'S BOTHERING FOR

00:57:07.257 --> 00:57:07.791
SOMETIME THE CHANCES ARE CAME

00:57:07.857 --> 00:57:10.260
DOWN AND TALK TO MY OFFICE.

00:57:10.326 --> 00:57:14.764
MANAGER WELL -- IN -- YOU KNOW.

00:57:14.831 --> 00:57:15.832
I THOUGHT ALLAY MY CONCERNS BUT

00:57:15.899 --> 00:57:17.000
THEY'RE BACK AS TO WHY WE'RE

00:57:17.066 --> 00:57:18.268
EVEN REQUIRING AN A AD

00:57:18.334 --> 00:57:20.036
TRANSFERRING THAT SEEMS ODD TO

00:57:20.103 --> 00:57:22.972
ME THAT WE WORK WE REQUIRE THAT.

00:57:23.039 --> 00:57:23.540
BECAUSE LOOKS LIKE THERE.

00:57:23.606 --> 00:57:25.074
IS FOR ONE AGAIN WHEN A STUDENT

00:57:25.141 --> 00:57:28.511
TRANSFERS TO THE TO SEE ISSUE.

00:57:28.578 --> 00:57:29.979
IT SCORE HIGHER.

00:57:30.046 --> 00:57:30.547
ON THE INDICATORS AND OF A

00:57:30.613 --> 00:57:31.815
STUDENT TRANSFERS TO THE UC AND

00:57:31.881 --> 00:57:33.449
WONDERING WHY THAT IS.

00:57:33.516 --> 00:57:34.684
AND AGAIN I'M STILL WONDERING GO

00:57:34.751 --> 00:57:37.287
BACK TO WHY WE HAVE THE A AND

00:57:37.353 --> 00:57:38.988
AND YOU CAN EVEN DANCES AT SIXTY

00:57:39.055 --> 00:57:41.291
UNITS IS FIFTY SIX WAS A FIFTY

00:57:41.357 --> 00:57:42.458
SIX IS THE MINIMUM REQUIRED AS A

00:57:42.525 --> 00:57:46.996
TO TRANSFER AS A AS I I I RECALL --

00:57:47.063 --> 00:57:48.665
BUT IF THE OTHER QUESTION I WITH

00:57:48.731 --> 00:57:49.632
GUARDED THIS FORMULA AND THE AND

00:57:49.699 --> 00:57:52.769
AND AND THAT AND THE MEASURES

00:57:52.836 --> 00:57:54.170
ASSOCIATED WITH THAT ARE.

00:57:54.237 --> 00:57:57.473
WOULD IT PROMOTE AND CREATE.

00:57:57.540 --> 00:57:58.808
THE A A WHAT IT -- WITH THE

00:57:58.875 --> 00:58:00.543
COLLEGE.

00:58:00.610 --> 00:58:02.779
GAME THE SYSTEM BY CREATING

00:58:02.846 --> 00:58:04.480
SHORT TERM CERTIFICATES THAT

00:58:04.547 --> 00:58:05.915
DON'T REALLY DO MUCH FOR

00:58:05.982 --> 00:58:08.017
STUDENTS.

00:58:08.084 --> 00:58:09.185
TO INSURE REVENUE GROWTH.

00:58:09.252 --> 00:58:12.722
AND YOU WANT TO SPEAK.

00:58:12.789 --> 00:58:13.556
TO BUILDING OUR HEART OF THAT --

00:58:13.623 --> 00:58:15.024
SO YOU KNOW I THINK WE'VE TALKED

00:58:15.091 --> 00:58:16.526
IN THE PAST ABOUT -- YOU KNOW

00:58:16.593 --> 00:58:19.329
THE THE EXPECTATION AROUND A

00:58:19.395 --> 00:58:21.231
TRANSFER WITH AN ASSOCIATE

00:58:21.297 --> 00:58:23.333
DEGREE -- BUT WE WOULD SAY

00:58:23.399 --> 00:58:24.601
WITHOUT THE FUNDING FORMULA DOES

00:58:24.667 --> 00:58:25.702
NOT REQUIRE IT IT CERTAINLY

00:58:25.768 --> 00:58:27.871
CREATES AN INCENTIVE FOR

00:58:27.937 --> 00:58:29.572
COLLEGES.

00:58:29.639 --> 00:58:30.106
TO BUT STUDENTS ON A PATH

00:58:30.173 --> 00:58:32.141
TOWARDS IN AT T..

00:58:32.208 --> 00:58:32.675
THE RATIONALE BEING THAT

00:58:32.742 --> 00:58:33.543
STUDENTS.

00:58:33.610 --> 00:58:35.345
ON A PATH TOWARDS IN AT T. OUR

00:58:35.411 --> 00:58:37.080
STUDENTS SHOULD NOT HAVE TO

00:58:37.146 --> 00:58:39.148
DECIDE UP FRONT WHEN THEY HAVE A

00:58:39.215 --> 00:58:40.183
GOAL TO TRANSFER WHERE

00:58:40.250 --> 00:58:41.718
SPECIFICALLY THEY WANT TO

00:58:41.784 --> 00:58:42.485
TRANSFER.

00:58:42.552 --> 00:58:43.953
THAT IN AT T. PROVIDES GREATER

00:58:44.020 --> 00:58:46.122
OPTIONS THE SYSTEMS WORKING WITH

00:58:46.189 --> 00:58:47.257
YOU SEE AN WITH INDEPENDENT

00:58:47.323 --> 00:58:48.925
COLLEGES TO MAKE SURE THAT THE

00:58:48.992 --> 00:58:51.361
AT T. AS A RECOGNIZE TRANSFER

00:58:51.427 --> 00:58:52.829
PATHWAY FOR THOSE INSTITUTIONS --

00:58:52.896 --> 00:58:54.530
IT MAKE SURE THAT STUDENTS LEAVE

00:58:54.597 --> 00:58:56.199
THE COLLEGES WITH A DEGREE IN

00:58:56.266 --> 00:58:58.134
CASE THEY TRANSFER NOT DON'T

00:58:58.201 --> 00:59:00.303
ULTIMATELY EARNED A DEGREE IT

00:59:00.370 --> 00:59:01.170
GIVES THEM SOME GUARANTEES A PAY

00:59:01.237 --> 00:59:02.605
ATTENDED THE CSU.

00:59:02.672 --> 00:59:03.606
RECOGNIZING YOUR CONCERNS I

00:59:03.673 --> 00:59:07.710
THINK THERE ARE -- THERE ARE

00:59:07.777 --> 00:59:10.179
POLICY WERE -- REASONS

00:59:10.246 --> 00:59:10.813
PROTECTIONS FOR STUDENTS THAT WE

00:59:10.880 --> 00:59:11.881
THINK.

00:59:11.948 --> 00:59:13.883
LEAVING WITH AT T. PROVIDE REAL

00:59:13.950 --> 00:59:14.918
QUICK IMAGE OVER THERE SO THAT

00:59:14.984 --> 00:59:15.919
IF I'M A COLLEGE I'M I'M I'M A

00:59:15.985 --> 00:59:16.486
COMMITTEE BECAUSE I'M GOING

00:59:16.552 --> 00:59:18.288
INCENTIVIZE OF STUDENTS FROM THE

00:59:18.354 --> 00:59:19.322
ASSOCIATE.

00:59:19.389 --> 00:59:20.757
THE A A PATH I MIGHT EVEN GIVE

00:59:20.823 --> 00:59:21.324
THEM CLASSES BEFORE I GIVE

00:59:21.391 --> 00:59:22.492
STUDENTS WHO AREN'T ON THE A

00:59:22.558 --> 00:59:23.793
PATH RIGHT.

00:59:23.860 --> 00:59:25.495
THAT'S A PROBLEM ISN'T IT.

00:59:25.561 --> 00:59:26.829
AND I THINK THE YOU KNOW THE THE

00:59:26.896 --> 00:59:28.298
THE RESPONSE MIGHT BE FOR

00:59:28.364 --> 00:59:29.933
STUDENTS WHO ENTER THE COLLEGE

00:59:29.999 --> 00:59:31.301
WITH AN EDUCATIONAL GOAL OF

00:59:31.367 --> 00:59:32.435
TRANSFER THERE SHOULD BE ONE

00:59:32.502 --> 00:59:33.970
PATH THERE SHOULD NOT BE A

00:59:34.037 --> 00:59:35.204
MULTIPLE PATHS THAT.

00:59:35.271 --> 00:59:36.606
A TRANSFER STUDENT WHO WANTS TO

00:59:36.673 --> 00:59:38.207
EARN AN A A TRANSFER STUDENT WHO

00:59:38.274 --> 00:59:39.742
WANTS TO SIMPLY TRANSFER WITHOUT

00:59:39.809 --> 00:59:41.744
A DEGREE SO I THINK THE GOAL IS

00:59:41.811 --> 00:59:46.582
HOW DO YOU MAKE THE AT T. --

00:59:46.649 --> 00:59:48.451
YEAH THE LEGISLATION -- LIMITS

00:59:48.518 --> 00:59:49.953
THE NUMBER OF UNITS IN AT T. AND

00:59:50.019 --> 00:59:51.955
THE GOAL IS TO SAY -- STUDENT

00:59:52.021 --> 00:59:53.823
SHOULD WHO SEEK TO TRANSFER

00:59:53.890 --> 00:59:56.793
SHOULD HAVE A A CLEAR PATHWAY TO

00:59:56.859 --> 00:59:59.128
TRANSFER BASED ON THE ACADEMIC

00:59:59.195 --> 01:00:01.664
PROGRAM THERE AND NOT BASED ON

01:00:01.731 --> 01:00:04.233
THE INSTITUTION OF THEIR THAT

01:00:04.300 --> 01:00:06.135
THEY ARE SEEKING TO TRANSFER --

01:00:06.202 --> 01:00:07.170
TO COULD YOU RECALL COULD THE

01:00:07.236 --> 01:00:09.038
REQUIREMENT THAT THEY HAVE A

01:00:09.105 --> 01:00:10.306
EIGHT FORCE THE JAKE UNITS THAT

01:00:10.373 --> 01:00:12.442
THEY MIGHT NOT EVEN NEED.

01:00:12.508 --> 01:00:13.943
I WOULD IMAGINE THERE'S A CASE

01:00:14.010 --> 01:00:15.611
THAT THAT -- I WOULD IMAGINE

01:00:15.678 --> 01:00:17.213
THAT THAT'S PROBABLY THE CASE IN

01:00:17.280 --> 01:00:18.715
SOME INSTANCES BUT I THINK IT'S

01:00:18.781 --> 01:00:20.083
TYPICAL WHAT'S THAT IT'S NOT A

01:00:20.149 --> 01:00:21.818
TYPICAL EXPERIENCE.

01:00:21.884 --> 01:00:23.786
I WOULD ARGUE IT'S NOT TYPICAL

01:00:23.853 --> 01:00:24.821
BUT I THINK THERE ARE FACULTY

01:00:24.887 --> 01:00:28.691
AND OTHERS HERE WHO PROBABLY --

01:00:28.758 --> 01:00:29.425
YOU KNOW WHAT THAT WORLD DAY

01:00:29.492 --> 01:00:30.526
TODAY.

01:00:30.593 --> 01:00:32.962
IT COULD PROBABLY ANSWER THAT.

01:00:33.029 --> 01:00:34.163
WE KEEP ON I'M SO I CUT YOU OFF

01:00:34.230 --> 01:00:36.599
OF NATO AND AND AND I AM --

01:00:36.666 --> 01:00:39.135
LOOKING -- FOR FOR MY NOTES ON

01:00:39.202 --> 01:00:45.675
YOUR SECOND QUESTION -- COULD

01:00:45.742 --> 01:00:47.610
YOU REMIND ME OF THE THE SECOND

01:00:47.677 --> 01:00:50.346
PART OF THE QUESTION -- IT HAD

01:00:50.413 --> 01:00:51.647
TO DO WITH INCENTIVIZE SOME

01:00:51.714 --> 01:00:53.850
COLLEGES BEING INCENTIVIZE THE

01:00:53.916 --> 01:00:55.318
TABLE BELOW VALUE CREATE --

01:00:55.385 --> 01:00:56.586
SHORT TERM CERTIFICATES TO

01:00:56.652 --> 01:00:59.022
PROMOTE STUDENT YOU KNOW YEAH

01:00:59.088 --> 01:01:00.957
RAPID STUDENT ACHIEVEMENT TESTS.

01:01:01.024 --> 01:01:01.991
MORE DOLLARS I THINK IT'S WHAT

01:01:02.058 --> 01:01:03.026
I'M PART YOU KNOW WHAT WE SAID

01:01:03.092 --> 01:01:04.293
IN THE BEGINNING AS WE NEED TO

01:01:04.360 --> 01:01:05.762
REVIEW THE FORMALIN SO MOVING

01:01:05.828 --> 01:01:07.864
FORWARD I THINK THAT'S A CLEAR --

01:01:07.930 --> 01:01:09.866
QUESTION THAT WE HAVE -- BEEN

01:01:09.932 --> 01:01:10.933
PARTNERING WITH OUTSIDE

01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:12.035
RESEARCHERS TO HELP US

01:01:12.101 --> 01:01:14.037
UNDERSTAND IS WHAT IMPACT DOES

01:01:14.103 --> 01:01:15.138
THIS FORMULA HAVE.

01:01:15.204 --> 01:01:16.339
ON THE OUTCOMES THAT OUR

01:01:16.406 --> 01:01:18.908
STUDENTS ATTAIN -- I WOULD JUST

01:01:18.975 --> 01:01:20.977
NOTE THAT -- IT I THINK.

01:01:21.044 --> 01:01:23.613
THIS FUNDING FORMULA LIVES --

01:01:23.679 --> 01:01:26.049
NEXT TO WITHIN -- A VARIETY OF

01:01:26.115 --> 01:01:27.650
OTHER PROCESS SEES INCLUDING --

01:01:27.717 --> 01:01:28.985
PROCESSES RELATED TO THE

01:01:29.052 --> 01:01:29.886
APPROVAL OF DEGREES AND

01:01:29.952 --> 01:01:32.255
CERTIFICATES THAT ARE INTENDED

01:01:32.321 --> 01:01:34.257
TO ENSURE PROGRAM INTEGRITY --

01:01:34.323 --> 01:01:36.259
AND SO -- WE THINK THAT THERE

01:01:36.325 --> 01:01:37.527
ARE PROTECTIONS IN THE SYSTEM

01:01:37.593 --> 01:01:39.095
BUT AGAIN -- SO THERE

01:01:39.162 --> 01:01:40.730
PROTECTIONS -- YOU KNOW

01:01:40.797 --> 01:01:42.298
CERTAINLY AROUND THE APPROVAL OF

01:01:42.365 --> 01:01:44.167
THOSE PROGRAMS WHETHER IT

01:01:44.233 --> 01:01:49.205
CHANGES -- HOW COLLEGES?

01:01:49.272 --> 01:01:50.339
PUT STUDENTS ON A PATHWAY AND

01:01:50.406 --> 01:01:51.741
WHETHER COLLEGES PUT MORE

01:01:51.808 --> 01:01:52.675
STUDENTS ON A PATHWAY TO A SHORT

01:01:52.742 --> 01:01:53.076
TERM CERTIFICATE.

01:01:53.142 --> 01:01:54.077
WE BELIEVE THERE ARE OTHER

01:01:54.143 --> 01:01:55.211
PROTECTIONS AND CERTAINLY

01:01:55.278 --> 01:01:57.246
INCENTIVES -- AND THE FUNDING

01:01:57.313 --> 01:01:58.614
FORMULA.

01:01:58.681 --> 01:02:01.551
THAT ASSIGN DIFFERENT VALUE TO

01:02:01.617 --> 01:02:03.519
DIFFERENT CREDENTIALS BASED ON

01:02:03.586 --> 01:02:04.787
BASED ON THE LENGTH OF DEGREE

01:02:04.854 --> 01:02:06.155
AND AND CERTAINLY THE LABOR

01:02:06.222 --> 01:02:07.590
MARKET VALUE OF THE DEGREE.

01:02:07.657 --> 01:02:10.159
AND SO -- WE THINK THAT THERE

01:02:10.226 --> 01:02:11.327
ARE WE THINK THE INCENTIVES A

01:02:11.394 --> 01:02:12.328
LOT OUR LINE WE THINK THERE

01:02:12.395 --> 01:02:13.996
PROTECTIONS BUT CERTAINLY WILL

01:02:14.063 --> 01:02:15.598
CONTINUE TO REVIEW.

01:02:15.665 --> 01:02:18.134
THERE WAS SOMETHING SOMETHING UP

01:02:18.201 --> 01:02:19.569
A LEGITIMATE BUT SOMETHING'S.

01:02:19.635 --> 01:02:20.236
I MAYBE THE WORDS WRONG HERE IF

01:02:20.303 --> 01:02:21.838
WE END UP WITH A TWO HUNDRED

01:02:21.904 --> 01:02:23.206
MILLION DOLLAR DEFICIT GIVE OR

01:02:23.272 --> 01:02:23.639
TAKE.

01:02:23.706 --> 01:02:25.508
RIGHT I MEAN THERE THE MATH

01:02:25.575 --> 01:02:26.876
SOMEWHERE IS WRONG.

01:02:26.943 --> 01:02:30.113
FORMULA SOMEWHERE IS WRONG I

01:02:30.179 --> 01:02:31.514
THINK WE'D ALL CONCEDE THAT.

01:02:31.581 --> 01:02:34.784
I THINK THE YOU KNOW I THINK.

01:02:34.851 --> 01:02:37.253
BUT I THINK WHAT IT SUGGESTS IS

01:02:37.320 --> 01:02:39.255
THAT IN DESIGNING THE FORMULA --

01:02:39.322 --> 01:02:43.626
THE PER -- WORKLOAD MEASURE RATE --

01:02:43.693 --> 01:02:45.461
MAY HAVE NEEDED TO BE REFINED

01:02:45.528 --> 01:02:47.763
PLASTER.

01:02:47.830 --> 01:02:49.065
JUST.

01:02:49.132 --> 01:02:50.133
ON THE ON THIS ISSUE OF SORT OF

01:02:50.199 --> 01:02:51.300
CERTIFICATE THAT THE THINK.

01:02:51.367 --> 01:02:52.535
UPON I THINK I THINK THERE IS

01:02:52.602 --> 01:02:54.203
THERE IS GOOD REASON TO WANT TO

01:02:54.270 --> 01:02:55.571
HONOR THE THIS ISSUE BECAUSE A

01:02:55.638 --> 01:02:58.741
BIG I I AGREE SOME LIBERAL DON'T

01:02:58.808 --> 01:03:00.042
AT THIS THE ONE OF THE THINGS

01:03:00.109 --> 01:03:00.676
THAT WE THOUGHT OF AS A BIGGER

01:03:00.743 --> 01:03:03.446
CONCERN WITH THE FORMULATE TERMS

01:03:03.513 --> 01:03:04.413
OF WHERE.

01:03:04.480 --> 01:03:05.581
THERE COULD BE GAMING IS THE

01:03:05.648 --> 01:03:06.916
ISSUE OF THE SORT OF THE LOWER

01:03:06.983 --> 01:03:08.284
UNIT CERTIFICATES THAT COULD BE

01:03:08.351 --> 01:03:09.418
A PLACE WHERE COLLEGES THAT'S

01:03:09.485 --> 01:03:10.920
BEEN THE RESOURCES WE THINK THAT

01:03:10.987 --> 01:03:11.787
THE RECOMMENDATION THAT WE

01:03:11.854 --> 01:03:13.389
SUGGEST -- AND I THINK OTHER

01:03:13.456 --> 01:03:14.824
GROUPS OF THE JUST AS WELL OF

01:03:14.891 --> 01:03:16.492
CAPPING THE MAXIMUM AMOUNT THAT

01:03:16.559 --> 01:03:17.026
YOU COULD RECEIVE FOR ANY

01:03:17.093 --> 01:03:18.694
INDIVIDUAL STUDENT AT WHATEVER

01:03:18.761 --> 01:03:20.096
THE HIGHEST JUST THE THE HIGHEST

01:03:20.163 --> 01:03:21.164
OUTCOME EARNED.

01:03:21.230 --> 01:03:22.732
IS ONE WAY TO DEAL WITH THAT

01:03:22.798 --> 01:03:24.033
ISSUE SAY IF YOU HAVE A STUDENT

01:03:24.100 --> 01:03:25.268
IS GETTING AN ASSOCIATE DEGREE.

01:03:25.334 --> 01:03:26.335
YOU KNOW TAKING ON ADDITIONAL

01:03:26.402 --> 01:03:27.537
CERTIFICATES ISN'T NECESSARILY

01:03:27.603 --> 01:03:29.138
GOING TO ADD ANY ADDITIONAL

01:03:29.205 --> 01:03:31.307
FUNDING FOR THAT THE CAM BECAUSE

01:03:31.374 --> 01:03:32.608
DISTRICT THAT'S I THINK WE THINK

01:03:32.675 --> 01:03:33.442
THAT COULD BE ONE WAY TO ADDRESS

01:03:33.509 --> 01:03:34.410
THAT.

01:03:34.477 --> 01:03:36.312
I WOULD SAY ALSO ONE OF THE

01:03:36.379 --> 01:03:37.013
PROPOSALS I KNOW WE FOR WE HEARD

01:03:37.079 --> 01:03:38.214
ABOUT SOME CONCERNS WITH

01:03:38.281 --> 01:03:39.415
COMPLEXITY OF THE FORMULA AND

01:03:39.482 --> 01:03:42.185
WHY DON'T WE SIMPLIFY IT SO THAT

01:03:42.251 --> 01:03:43.653
AFTER THE EVERY OUTCOME GETS THE

01:03:43.719 --> 01:03:44.820
SAME AMOUNT OF FUNDING.

01:03:44.887 --> 01:03:46.189
I ACTUALLY THINK THAT IF WE DID

01:03:46.255 --> 01:03:47.523
THAT I WOULD HAVE MORE CONCERNS

01:03:47.590 --> 01:03:48.457
WITH THOSE SPECIFIC ISSUES

01:03:48.524 --> 01:03:50.393
BECAUSE IN THAT CASE THEN YOU

01:03:50.459 --> 01:03:51.794
WOULD HAVE AN EIGHTEEN UNITS

01:03:51.861 --> 01:03:53.696
CERTIFICATE THAT HAS THE SAME

01:03:53.763 --> 01:03:55.164
VALUE ESTATE SOMEONE WHO

01:03:55.231 --> 01:03:59.869
TRANSFERRED OR SOMEONE WHO GETS

01:03:59.936 --> 01:04:01.003
AN ASSOCIATE DEGREE.

01:04:01.070 --> 01:04:01.771
IF THAT'S THE WAY WE WOULD

01:04:01.837 --> 01:04:02.438
CREATE FOR NOT THAT I THINK THAT

01:04:02.505 --> 01:04:03.539
WE WOULD START TO BE MORE

01:04:03.606 --> 01:04:04.507
CONCERNED ABOUT THAT BECAUSE NOW.

01:04:04.574 --> 01:04:06.075
AS THEY CAN BECAUSE DISTRICT YOU

01:04:06.142 --> 01:04:06.609
GET THE SAME OUTCOMES FOR

01:04:06.676 --> 01:04:07.877
GETTING SOMEBODY TO AN EIGHTEEN

01:04:07.944 --> 01:04:08.544
UNIT PROGRAM.

01:04:08.611 --> 01:04:10.813
AS SOMEONE WHO GOES TO A SIXTY

01:04:10.880 --> 01:04:12.848
UNIT PROGRAM SO THAT'S I THINK

01:04:12.915 --> 01:04:13.216
WHY THERE IS.

01:04:13.282 --> 01:04:13.849
IT'S IT'S IMPORTANT FOR US TO

01:04:13.916 --> 01:04:15.651
MONITOR WHAT'S GOING ON WITH ALL

01:04:15.718 --> 01:04:16.886
THESE HOW DO WE KNOW THAT WE'VE

01:04:16.953 --> 01:04:18.054
GOTTEN THE RIGHT VALUES FOR EACH

01:04:18.120 --> 01:04:19.422
OF THEM IS VERY DIFFICULT.

01:04:19.488 --> 01:04:21.958
BUT IF WE DO -- ARE WE IF WE

01:04:22.024 --> 01:04:23.492
HAVE A SIMPLE MORE SIMPLIFIED

01:04:23.559 --> 01:04:25.261
SYSTEM THAT IS A BOARDING

01:04:25.328 --> 01:04:26.062
EVERYBODY ABOUT THE SAME AMOUNT

01:04:26.128 --> 01:04:26.596
OF WHEN.

01:04:26.662 --> 01:04:28.497
THE AMOUNT OF WORK REQUIRED TO

01:04:28.564 --> 01:04:29.131
GET THESE DIFFERENT DEGREES IS

01:04:29.198 --> 01:04:31.033
VERY DIFFERENT THAT COULD BE

01:04:31.100 --> 01:04:32.368
MORE PROBLEMATIC AND THE TERMS

01:04:32.435 --> 01:04:33.102
OF JUST.

01:04:33.169 --> 01:04:37.974
HOW HOW COLLEGES MIGHT RESPOND?

01:04:38.040 --> 01:04:39.075
YEAH LET ME JUST WE INTEND TO

01:04:39.141 --> 01:04:39.742
MAKE A SET OF RECOMMENDATIONS TO

01:04:39.809 --> 01:04:40.576
YOU ALL BY THE END OF THE MONTH

01:04:40.643 --> 01:04:41.644
ABOUT CHANGES TO THE FORMULA --

01:04:41.711 --> 01:04:42.912
WE HAVE VETTED OF THE

01:04:42.979 --> 01:04:43.846
LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE

01:04:43.913 --> 01:04:45.314
PROPOSAL ON COUNTING ONLY THE

01:04:45.381 --> 01:04:46.949
HIGHEST AWARD WITH A VARIETY OF

01:04:47.016 --> 01:04:48.517
STAKEHOLDER GROUPS INCLUDING OUR

01:04:48.584 --> 01:04:50.386
CONSULTATION COUNCIL I THINK IT

01:04:50.453 --> 01:04:52.622
IS A RECOMMENDATION THAT WE WILL

01:04:52.688 --> 01:04:54.557
BE SUPPORTIVE OF RECOMMENDATIONS

01:04:54.624 --> 01:04:55.291
TO US WITH.

YEAR OF COLLEGE.

01:08:49.792 --> 01:08:50.860
OUR OFFICE DOES HAVE A NUMBER OF

01:08:50.926 --> 01:08:52.962
CONSENSUS THIS PROPOSAL WHICH

01:08:53.028 --> 01:08:54.897
ARE SUMMARIZED ON PAGE FIFTEEN

01:08:54.964 --> 01:08:56.332
OF YOUR AGENDA.

01:08:56.398 --> 01:08:59.168
TOWARD THE MIDDLE OF THE PAGE.

01:08:59.235 --> 01:09:00.503
OUR FIRST CONCERN IS PRIMARILY A

01:09:00.569 --> 01:09:02.371
MATTER OF TIMING.

01:09:02.438 --> 01:09:04.340
BECAUSE TWENTY EIGHTEEN NINETEEN

01:09:04.406 --> 01:09:04.940
IS THE FIRST YEAR IN WHICH THE

01:09:05.007 --> 01:09:06.075
STATE IS FUNDED THE COLLEGE

OTHER STUDENT OUTCOMES.

01:09:15.718 --> 01:09:16.318
AND ABOUT A BETTER UNDERSTANDING

01:09:16.385 --> 01:09:17.119
OF HOW THE PROGRAM IS CURRENTLY

01:09:17.186 --> 01:09:18.387
PERFORMING WE THINK IT MAY BE

01:09:18.454 --> 01:09:20.589
PREMATURE TO SUBSTANTIALLY

01:09:20.656 --> 01:09:22.458
EXPAND FUNDING FOR IT.

01:09:22.525 --> 01:09:24.560
I SECOND CONCERN IS MORE

01:09:24.627 --> 01:09:26.362
DISTRIBUTIONAL IN NATURE.

01:09:26.428 --> 01:09:28.230
THERE IS CURRENTLY A SUBSTANTIAL

01:09:28.297 --> 01:09:29.865
AMOUNT OF ON MATT FINANCIAL NEED

01:09:29.932 --> 01:09:31.901
AMONG COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENTS

01:09:31.967 --> 01:09:33.002
PARTICULARLY WHEN IT COMES TO

01:09:33.068 --> 01:09:35.404
NON TUITION COSTS WHICH ARE NOT

01:09:35.471 --> 01:09:35.905
COVERED BY THE BOARD OF

01:09:37.506 --> 01:09:38.874
STUDENTS.

01:09:38.941 --> 01:09:40.643
IF THE GOAL IS TO INCREASE

01:09:40.709 --> 01:09:42.044
COLLEGE AFFORDABILITY THAN WE

01:09:42.111 --> 01:09:42.978
THINK IT MAKES SENSE TO

01:09:43.045 --> 01:09:44.513
PRIORITIZE ADDRESSING THE

01:09:44.580 --> 01:09:46.048
EXISTING ON MIGHT NEED.

01:09:46.115 --> 01:09:47.550
BEFORE EXPANDING IT FOR STUDENTS

01:09:47.616 --> 01:09:49.985
WHO DO NOT DEMONSTRATE NEED.

01:09:50.052 --> 01:09:51.320
FINALLY OUR THIRD POINT JUST

01:09:51.387 --> 01:09:52.521
RETURNS TO THE IDEA THE COLLEGE

COLLEGES TO IMPROVE STUDENT

01:09:58.127 --> 01:09:58.861
SUPPORT.

01:09:58.928 --> 01:09:59.495
HERE WE WOULD JUST NOTE THAT

01:09:59.562 --> 01:10:00.462
SINCE CREATING THE COLLEGE

01:10:00.529 --> 01:10:01.897
PROMISE PROGRAM THE LEGISLATURE

01:10:01.964 --> 01:10:03.399
HAS ALSO ENACTED SEVERAL OTHER

01:10:03.465 --> 01:10:05.234
REFORMS INCLUDING THE NEW

01:10:05.301 --> 01:10:06.235

01:10:06.302 --> 01:10:07.670
THAT PROVIDE EVEN LARGER FISCAL

01:10:07.736 --> 01:10:09.838
INCENTIVES FOR COLLEGES TO

ENHANCE STUDENT SUPPORT. FOR

01:10:11.540 --> 01:10:12.408
THESE REASONS OUR OFFICE DOES

01:10:12.474 --> 01:10:13.409
RECOMMEND REJECTING THE

GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL AND

GOAL AS BEING AN ACCESS

01:25:08.002 --> 01:25:08.937

GENERATIONS FAMILIES.

01:25:26.187 --> 01:25:27.322
I THINK THAT IS AN IMPORTANT

01:25:27.388 --> 01:25:28.690
POINT TO MAKE HAS MANY TIMES

01:25:28.756 --> 01:25:30.258

GOVERNOR'S BUDGET JUST GONNA

01:25:32.694 --> 01:25:34.362
BENEFIT -- SINCE THEY DO NOT

01:25:34.429 --> 01:25:35.730
HAVE NEEDS BUT OUR ABILITY TO

01:25:35.797 --> 01:25:37.265

EASILY UNDER SAID.

01:25:45.874 --> 01:25:46.574
SO WHERE WE GOING FROM HERE.

01:25:46.641 --> 01:25:47.642
WE ARE WITH THE SUPPORT OF AARCS

01:25:47.709 --> 01:25:48.309
FOUNDATION DOING A THREE YEAR ON

01:26:01.122 --> 01:26:02.257
CARROT HELP SINCE THE MOVEMENT

01:26:02.323 --> 01:26:04.859
PROCESS BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT

01:26:04.926 --> 01:26:06.227
AXIS ISN'T SIMPLY ENOUGH.

01:26:06.294 --> 01:26:07.161
AND WE'RE TRYING TO MOVE THIS

01:26:07.228 --> 01:26:08.463
FROM AN ACCESS PROGRAM TO

01:26:08.530 --> 01:26:09.664
ACTUALLY COMPLETION PROGRAM

AT CITY UNIVERSITY NEW YORK ME

01:26:49.671 --> 01:26:50.872

TUITION WAIVERS.

01:27:01.616 --> 01:27:02.850
COUPLE THAT WITH LOCAL MONIES TO

01:27:02.917 --> 01:27:06.688
PROVIDE THIS ADDITIONAL

01:27:06.754 --> 01:27:08.056
REFERENCE SERVICES.

01:27:08.122 --> 01:27:09.390
SO FINALLY I SHOULD WITH YOU TO

01:27:09.457 --> 01:27:10.258
HEAR TODAY OF POLICY BRIEF THAT

01:27:10.325 --> 01:27:10.858
I PUT TOGETHER THAT REALLY IT

01:27:10.925 --> 01:27:11.793
TAKES A LOOK AT WHAT'S HAPPENING

01:27:11.859 --> 01:27:13.928
OUT THERE NATIONWIDE AND WE ALL

01:27:13.995 --> 01:27:15.463
KNOW SOME OF THE CHALLENGES WITH

01:27:15.530 --> 01:27:17.098
WORKFORCE RAID READINESS.

01:27:17.165 --> 01:27:18.900
STUDENT DAT -- ACCESS TO HIGHER

01:27:18.967 --> 01:27:19.968
EDUCATION AND THOSE ARE WELL

01:27:20.034 --> 01:27:22.070
DOCUMENTED BUT LOOKING AT

01:27:22.136 --> 01:27:24.772
TENNESSEE FOR AGAIN NEW YORK

01:27:24.839 --> 01:27:25.940
THESE OTHER THESE OTHER STATES

01:27:26.007 --> 01:27:27.208
ARE TAKING ONLY ON STATE WHERE

01:27:27.275 --> 01:27:29.844
PROGRAMS -- WE ARE THERE ALONG A

01:27:29.911 --> 01:27:31.112
LONGER SIDE BUT I THINK

01:27:31.179 --> 01:27:32.714
CALIFORNIA HAS A CHANCE HERE TO

01:27:32.780 --> 01:27:34.649
BE A LEADER AGAIN AS WE OFTEN

01:27:34.716 --> 01:27:35.350
HAD.

01:27:35.416 --> 01:27:37.218
AND NOT JUST MAKE THIS ABOUT A

01:27:37.285 --> 01:27:38.620
ONE YEAR ACCESS INITIATIVE BUT

01:27:38.686 --> 01:27:41.089
MOVE FROM ACCESS TO COMPLETION

01:27:41.155 --> 01:27:42.557
BY PROVIDING MULTIPLE YEARS.

01:27:42.624 --> 01:27:44.626
OF TUITION WAIVERS FOR STUDENTS

01:27:44.692 --> 01:27:45.994
SO NOT ONLY CAN THEY GET IN THE

01:27:46.060 --> 01:27:47.695
DOOR BUT THEY CAN ACTUALLY GET

01:27:47.762 --> 01:27:49.397

SOCIETY SO.

01:27:51.499 --> 01:27:55.036
I WOULD ENCOURAGE YOU TO THINK

01:27:55.103 --> 01:27:56.037
MORE THAN TWO YEARS.

01:27:56.104 --> 01:27:57.138
I WOULD SAY I THINK TWO YEARS IS

01:27:57.205 --> 01:27:58.072
THE NEXT STEP I THINK HERE'S THE

01:27:58.139 --> 01:27:58.773
NEXT STEP WHICH IS A GOOD

01:27:58.840 --> 01:27:59.807
ALIGNMENT WITH YOUR GUIDED

01:27:59.874 --> 01:28:01.109
PATHWAYS INITIATIVE IN YOUR

01:28:01.175 --> 01:28:02.577
FOCUS ON COMPLETION.

01:28:02.644 --> 01:28:04.178
AND I WOULD ENCOURAGE THIS

01:28:04.245 --> 01:28:06.080
COMMITTEE TO LOOK AT SUPPORTING --

01:28:06.147 --> 01:28:07.882

01:28:07.949 --> 01:28:09.017
PROPOSED BUDGET.

01:28:09.083 --> 01:28:10.985
METHODS TO MAKE PROGRESS TOWARD

01:28:11.052 --> 01:28:12.453
THAT SECOND YEAR I COULD TELL

01:28:12.520 --> 01:28:13.488

BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT SOMETIMES

01:28:20.728 --> 01:28:21.696
IT TAKES SINCE MORE THAN TWO

01:28:21.763 --> 01:28:23.264

A COLLEGE THAT ACTUALLY LAUNCHED

01:28:49.590 --> 01:28:52.093
A PROMISE -- JUST PRIOR TO THE

01:28:52.160 --> 01:28:53.428
IS REALLY AT THE EARLY PART OF

01:28:53.494 --> 01:28:54.962
THE WAVE HERE IN CALIFORNIA SO I

01:28:55.029 --> 01:28:55.997
THOUGHT I COULD SHARE WITH YOU A

01:28:56.064 --> 01:28:57.632
LITTLE BIT OF WHAT WE'VE LEARNED --

01:28:57.699 --> 01:28:59.500
THIS IS SOMETHING THAT I HAD A

01:28:59.567 --> 01:29:00.835
OPPORTUNITY TO SHARE WITH THE

01:29:00.902 --> 01:29:02.937

MOAN AND AND THIS IS -- REALLY

01:29:06.040 --> 01:29:07.208
AN OVERVIEW OF WHAT WE HAVE

01:29:07.275 --> 01:29:09.944
TRIED TO DO I WILL SKIP THROUGH --

01:29:10.011 --> 01:29:11.512
SOME THE OVERVIEW AND AND YOU

01:29:11.579 --> 01:29:12.747
CAN TAKE A LOOK AT THAT WELL BUT

01:29:12.814 --> 01:29:15.083
BUT WHAT WE TRIED TO DO IN IN

01:29:15.149 --> 01:29:16.117
TWENTY FIFTEEN WE REALLY SET OUT

01:29:16.184 --> 01:29:17.752
TO SEE WHAT A MODEL PROMISE

01:29:17.819 --> 01:29:18.753
MIGHT LOOK LIKE IN THIS WAS AT A

01:29:18.820 --> 01:29:19.954
TIME WHEN THERE WERE ONLY THREE

01:29:20.021 --> 01:29:21.189
PROMISE EFFORTS IN.

01:29:21.255 --> 01:29:22.557
THE STATE -- THOSE WERE OF

01:29:22.623 --> 01:29:24.225
COURSE VENTURA FIRST -- THEN

01:29:24.292 --> 01:29:26.260
LONG BEACH AND THEN ON TO QUEST

01:29:26.327 --> 01:29:27.895
OUR NEIGHBOR TO THE NORTH SO

01:29:27.962 --> 01:29:29.697
WHAT WE DID IS WE'VE SURVEYED

01:29:29.764 --> 01:29:30.932
ABOUT -- THIRTY PROGRAMS AROUND

01:29:30.998 --> 01:29:32.700
THE COUNTRY THE TIME TO ASK WHAT

01:29:32.767 --> 01:29:34.368
REALLY WORKED BEST AND IF IF

01:29:34.435 --> 01:29:36.037
RESOURCES WEREN'T THE BARRIER

01:29:36.104 --> 01:29:37.538
WHAT WOULD BE POSSIBLE -- THE

01:29:37.605 --> 01:29:39.307
WAY THEY THEY ALL CAME BACK WITH

01:29:39.373 --> 01:29:40.942
THEIR RESPONSES WAS WAS --

01:29:41.008 --> 01:29:42.844
UNANIMOUS ESSENTIALLY THAT THAT

01:29:42.910 --> 01:29:43.911
IF THEY WEREN'T THE IF THEY

01:29:43.978 --> 01:29:45.613
WEREN'T CONSTRAINED BY RESOURCES

01:29:45.680 --> 01:29:47.381
THEY WOULD DO TO FOR YEARS ALL

01:29:47.448 --> 01:29:48.850
INCLUSIVE AN OPEN ACCESS TO THE

01:29:48.916 --> 01:29:50.685
ENTIRETY OF THE THE LOCAL SCHOOL

01:29:50.752 --> 01:29:54.388
DISTRICTS.

01:29:54.455 --> 01:29:55.523
SO THAT'S HOW WE SET OUT TO DO --

01:29:55.590 --> 01:29:56.090
AND WE MADE OUR ELIGIBILITY

01:29:56.157 --> 01:29:56.591
REQUIREMENTS VERY BROAD

01:29:56.657 --> 01:29:58.192
INTENTIONALLY -- WE CAN TALK

01:29:58.259 --> 01:29:58.826
ABOUT THAT LATER IF THERE'S AN

01:29:58.893 --> 01:30:01.129
INTEREST -- BUT YOU CAN SEE HERE

01:30:01.195 --> 01:30:02.363
THE THE SCOPE AND DESIGN WAS

01:30:02.430 --> 01:30:03.631
BASICALLY BASED ON OUR RESEARCH

01:30:03.698 --> 01:30:04.665
AND THERE ARE THREE PRIMARY

01:30:04.732 --> 01:30:06.200
COLORS TO THAT THE FIRST WAS

01:30:06.267 --> 01:30:07.635
COMPLETELY OPEN ACCESS TO ALL

01:30:07.702 --> 01:30:09.637
LOCAL STUDENTS -- AND THAT WAS

01:30:09.704 --> 01:30:11.272
REGARDLESS OF OF PERFORMANCE IN

01:30:11.339 --> 01:30:13.040
HIGH SCHOOL REGARDLESS OF

01:30:13.107 --> 01:30:14.642
DEMONSTRATED NEED OR NOT BECAUSE

01:30:14.709 --> 01:30:15.443
WE ALL KNOW THAT THERE ARE

01:30:15.510 --> 01:30:16.811
THERE'S COURSE NEED IT'S OFTEN

01:30:16.878 --> 01:30:17.879
NOT.

01:30:17.945 --> 01:30:19.914
CLEAR -- WHEN WHEN PUT TO PAPER

01:30:19.981 --> 01:30:21.549
SO WHAT WE DID IS WE OFFER THAT

01:30:21.616 --> 01:30:24.252
WE PRICED IT OUT -- AND WE CAME

01:30:24.318 --> 01:30:25.386
UP WITH ABOUT A TWO POINT FOUR

01:30:25.453 --> 01:30:26.687
MILLION DOLLAR ANNUAL

01:30:26.754 --> 01:30:28.256
EXPENDITURE TO DO THIS FOR OUR

01:30:28.322 --> 01:30:29.557
STUDENTS IN OUR DISTRICT AND AS

01:30:29.624 --> 01:30:31.559
OF TODAY IT'S ACTUALLY ABOUT

01:30:31.626 --> 01:30:32.193
SEVENTEEN HUNDRED STUDENTS THAT

01:30:32.260 --> 01:30:34.195
ARE RECEIVING THIS. TO SEVENTEEN

01:30:34.262 --> 01:30:34.796
HUNDRED STUDENTS COMING FROM

01:30:34.862 --> 01:30:37.799
WITHIN OUR AT STCC DISTRICTS OF

01:30:37.865 --> 01:30:38.766
THE COMMITTEE COLLEGE DISTRICT

01:30:38.833 --> 01:30:39.934
WHICH ENCOMPASSES TWO LARGE

01:30:40.001 --> 01:30:41.435
PUBLIC DISTRICTS AND IN EVERY

01:30:41.502 --> 01:30:43.838
MANNER OF PRIVATE HOME SCHOOL --

01:30:43.905 --> 01:30:45.406
EVERY COMPLETION YOU CAN THINK

01:30:45.473 --> 01:30:46.841
OF THAT THAT'S WHAT WE'RE

01:30:46.908 --> 01:30:48.042
INCLUDING SO IT'S REALLY BROAD

01:30:48.109 --> 01:30:50.178
BASED -- WE DID ABOUT A HUNDRED

01:30:50.244 --> 01:30:51.612
INTERVIEWS IN THE COMMUNITY TO

01:30:51.679 --> 01:30:53.014
TO FIGURE OUT -- WHAT WOULD BE

01:30:53.080 --> 01:30:55.583
SUPPORTED AND AND CAME BACK WITH

01:30:55.650 --> 01:30:56.184
WITH THE UNANIMOUS SUPPORT FOR

01:30:56.250 --> 01:30:57.084
THIS SO?

01:30:57.151 --> 01:30:58.853
IN THE END WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO

01:30:58.920 --> 01:31:00.888
DO HERE IS IS CHAU -- GATHER THE

01:31:00.955 --> 01:31:02.089
DATA THAT WILL SHOW THAT THIS IS

01:31:02.156 --> 01:31:02.957
ACTUALLY GOING TO MOVE THE

01:31:03.024 --> 01:31:04.692
NEEDLE ON STUDENT SUCCESS

01:31:04.759 --> 01:31:05.193
STUDENT PERSISTENCE TO

01:31:05.259 --> 01:31:07.128
COMPLETION AND YOU CAN SEE HERE

01:31:07.195 --> 01:31:08.696
IN WHAT I'VE HANDED YOU.

01:31:08.763 --> 01:31:10.298
A LITTLE BIT OF THAT DATA -- THE

01:31:10.364 --> 01:31:11.999
FIRST COUPLE ARE ARE JUST A

01:31:12.066 --> 01:31:12.834
LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE LOW THE

01:31:12.900 --> 01:31:14.936
STUDENTS CARRY WE REQUIRED THE

01:31:15.002 --> 01:31:15.736
THREE THINGS THAT THE RESEARCH

01:31:15.803 --> 01:31:17.238
ALL AGREED ON FULL TIME STUDENT

01:31:17.305 --> 01:31:18.606
STATUS -- WE KNOW THERE'S A

01:31:18.673 --> 01:31:20.141
COURSE THE COMPLICATION OF THAT

01:31:20.208 --> 01:31:21.275
BECAUSE THERE SOME STUDENTS WERE

01:31:21.342 --> 01:31:23.244
THAT'S JUST NOT POSSIBLE -- ALSO

01:31:23.311 --> 01:31:25.546
TAKING ADVANTAGE OF OUR

01:31:25.613 --> 01:31:27.582
COMMUNITY WELL THE VARIOUS TYPES

01:31:27.648 --> 01:31:30.451
OF OF COUNSELING ON ON CAMPUS --

01:31:30.518 --> 01:31:32.420
CAN BE COHORT STYLE CAN BE WITH

01:31:32.486 --> 01:31:34.021
OUR GENERAL COUNSEL DEPARTMENT

01:31:34.088 --> 01:31:35.957
AND THEN WE HAVE TO HAVE

01:31:36.023 --> 01:31:37.225
STUDENTS ACTUALLY BUT YOU GET

01:31:37.291 --> 01:31:38.526
WITHIN A YEAR SO WE HAVE ABOUT A

01:31:38.593 --> 01:31:39.594
YEAR'S WINDOW FROM THE HIGH

01:31:39.660 --> 01:31:40.728
SCHOOL COMPLETION.

01:31:40.795 --> 01:31:41.729
WHEN THAT WAS ALL SAID AND DONE

01:31:41.796 --> 01:31:43.431
YOU CAN SEE HERE ARE COMPLETION

01:31:43.497 --> 01:31:44.699
AND PERSISTENCE RATES UP TO DATE

01:31:44.765 --> 01:31:46.100
NOW ARE ONLY IN OUR THIRTY YEARS

01:31:46.167 --> 01:31:47.068
SO WE ONLY HAVE ONE COHORT

01:31:47.134 --> 01:31:47.635
THAT'S MADE IT ALL THE WAY

01:31:47.702 --> 01:31:48.369
THROUGH?

01:31:48.436 --> 01:31:49.737
BUT WHAT WE CAN SHOW IS THAT

01:31:49.804 --> 01:31:51.138
WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO TO REALLY

01:31:51.205 --> 01:31:55.309
BOOST THE PERSISTENCE RATES IN

01:31:55.376 --> 01:31:56.510
THOSE FIRST FEW SEMESTERS SO

01:31:56.577 --> 01:31:57.144
THIS IS GOING BACK JUST TO THE

01:31:57.211 --> 01:31:58.679
FALL OF TWENTY SIXTEEN NOW WE

01:31:58.746 --> 01:31:59.180
ACTUALLY HAVE ABOUT 85%

01:31:59.247 --> 01:32:00.348
ASSISTANCE RATE. FOR THAT FIRST

01:32:00.414 --> 01:32:02.416
TO SECOND SEMESTER -- WHICH IS

01:32:02.483 --> 01:32:03.684
THE BENCHMARK THAT WE'RE NOW

01:32:03.751 --> 01:32:05.386
WORKING WITH EVERYTHING ELSE ON

01:32:05.453 --> 01:32:06.787
THE SECOND THIRD -- COHORTS OR

01:32:06.854 --> 01:32:07.755
SOME MORE DATA HERE ABOUT WHAT

01:32:07.822 --> 01:32:08.656
THEY'RE STUDYING BUT I THINK THE

01:32:08.723 --> 01:32:10.424
MOST IMPRESSIVE -- GO ARE THESE

01:32:10.491 --> 01:32:11.993
LAST TWO GRAPHS IF YOU YOU LOOK

01:32:12.059 --> 01:32:13.628
AT FULL TIME STATUS FOR THE LAST

01:32:13.694 --> 01:32:14.562
TEN YEARS.

01:32:14.629 --> 01:32:15.596
AND WHAT YOU'LL SEE THE BAR

01:32:15.663 --> 01:32:17.131
GRAPH -- GIVE THE DETAILS BUT

01:32:17.198 --> 01:32:18.833
THAT THAT FULL TIME STATUS LINE

01:32:18.900 --> 01:32:21.435
GRAPH -- IT BASICALLY INVERTS SO

01:32:21.502 --> 01:32:23.037
BY REQUIRING IN SUPPORTING FULL

01:32:23.104 --> 01:32:24.505
TIME STUDENT STATUS WHAT WE HAVE

01:32:24.572 --> 01:32:26.407
IS GOING FROM A TWO TO ONE TO A

01:32:26.474 --> 01:32:27.942
ONE TO TWO RATIO AS FAR AS WHAT

01:32:28.009 --> 01:32:29.277
OUR LOCAL STUDENTS DOING SO

01:32:29.343 --> 01:32:30.578
THAT'S THAT'S REALLY THE THE

01:32:30.645 --> 01:32:31.746
PROBABLY MOST POWERFUL DATA

01:32:31.812 --> 01:32:32.980
POINT WE HAVE TODAY.

01:32:33.047 --> 01:32:34.348
WHICH IS THAT BY INCENTIVIZING

01:32:34.415 --> 01:32:35.917
AND REMOVING SOME OF THESE

01:32:35.983 --> 01:32:38.052
BARRIERS THAT'S ACTUALLY WORKING --

01:32:38.119 --> 01:32:39.787
IN IT NOW WE'RE JUST IN OUR

01:32:39.854 --> 01:32:40.688
THIRTY YEARS SO WE KNOW THAT

01:32:40.755 --> 01:32:42.290
WE'LL SEE SOME VARIATION THERE

01:32:42.356 --> 01:32:42.890
BUT THAT'S THAT'S REALLY THE

01:32:42.957 --> 01:32:43.791
FIRST.

01:32:43.858 --> 01:32:44.358
AND THEN TO MOVE ON TO THE

01:32:44.425 --> 01:32:45.226
DOLLAR SIDE OF IT WHICH OF

01:32:45.293 --> 01:32:46.027
COURSE IS WHAT WE'RE HERE TO

01:32:46.093 --> 01:32:48.129
TALK ABOUT TODAY IF YOU LOOK AT

01:32:48.195 --> 01:32:49.397
THAT LAST BLOCK GRAPH YOU I

01:32:49.463 --> 01:32:50.531
WOULD TRY TO SHOW YOU BY

01:32:50.598 --> 01:32:52.133
STACKING THE VARIOUS FORMS OF

01:32:52.199 --> 01:32:53.534
SUPPORT WHAT WE'RE DOING NOW.

01:32:53.601 --> 01:32:55.169
IN OUR CASE WE STARTED THIS

01:32:55.236 --> 01:32:56.304
EXCLUSIVELY WITH PRIVATE

01:32:56.370 --> 01:32:57.405
FUNDRAISING ALSO JUST

01:32:57.471 --> 01:32:59.440
PHILANTHROPY -- AND THEN WITH

01:32:59.507 --> 01:33:00.975
THE REBRAND OF THE BOG WAIVER

01:33:01.042 --> 01:33:02.076
AND THEN THE INTRODUCTION OF THE

01:33:02.143 --> 01:33:03.778
CALIFORNIA COLLEGE PROMISE --

01:33:03.844 --> 01:33:04.979
THERE'S MORE PIECES TO THE

01:33:05.046 --> 01:33:06.380
PUZZLE BUT IF YOU LOOK AT THAT

01:33:06.447 --> 01:33:10.818
STACK WHAT IT SHOWS THERE IS

01:33:10.885 --> 01:33:11.385
THAT THE CALIFORNIA PROMISE

01:33:11.452 --> 01:33:12.353
GRANTS.

01:33:12.420 --> 01:33:12.987
ACTUALLY COVERS ABOUT A LITTLE

01:33:13.054 --> 01:33:13.688
OVER A THIRD.

01:33:13.754 --> 01:33:14.755
OF OF THE TOTAL COST OF WHAT

01:33:14.822 --> 01:33:16.590
WE'RE OFFERING -- AND SO WE

01:33:16.657 --> 01:33:17.692
THINK THAT THAT IS OF COURSE THE

01:33:17.758 --> 01:33:19.026
FOUNDATION THAT'S THE LONGEST

01:33:19.093 --> 01:33:20.561
STANDING OFFER AND THAT IS THE

01:33:20.628 --> 01:33:21.996
BASELINE OF SUPPORT -- YOU THEN

01:33:22.063 --> 01:33:23.698
SEE THERE THAT -- WE WE COVER

01:33:23.764 --> 01:33:25.566
THE THE ROMAN FEES FOR THE

01:33:25.633 --> 01:33:27.068
REMAINDER AND THEN THE LARGEST

01:33:27.134 --> 01:33:28.369
PIECE OF THIS AND AGAIN THIS IS

01:33:28.436 --> 01:33:29.470
ANOTHER DEMONSTRATION OF THAT

01:33:29.537 --> 01:33:30.671
I'M SURE YOU'VE SEEN.

01:33:30.738 --> 01:33:31.939
IS THAT IT'S ACTUALLY THE BOOKS

01:33:32.006 --> 01:33:34.041
SUPPLIES AND EVERYTHING ELSE --

01:33:34.108 --> 01:33:35.009
THAT IS THE GREATER BARRIER AND

01:33:35.076 --> 01:33:35.876
THAT'S WHAT WE'RE SHOULD WE'RE

01:33:35.943 --> 01:33:36.877
COVERING EXCLUSIVELY WITH

01:33:36.944 --> 01:33:38.512
PRIVATE PHILANTHROPIC DOLLARS.

01:33:38.579 --> 01:33:40.214
OF COURSE IF WE COULD WE WOULD

01:33:40.281 --> 01:33:41.749
GO BEYOND THAT AN OFFER OTHER --

01:33:41.816 --> 01:33:43.150
FULL COST KIND OF SUPPORT THAT

01:33:43.217 --> 01:33:44.719
RIGHT AT THIS POINT THAT'S WHAT

01:33:44.785 --> 01:33:47.088
WE'RE OFFERING.

01:33:47.154 --> 01:33:48.622
ON AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE SEEING.

01:33:48.689 --> 01:33:49.223
THE BIG THINGS ARE GRAPPLING

01:33:49.290 --> 01:33:50.725
WITH NOW AND AND I THINK THE

01:33:50.791 --> 01:33:52.526
THINGS THAT ARE -- THEY'RE GOING

01:33:52.593 --> 01:33:53.761
TO GRAPPLE WITH OBVIOUSLY IN THE

01:33:53.828 --> 01:33:55.896
IN THE BUDGET PROCESS ARE HARD

01:33:55.963 --> 01:33:57.264
TO PRIMARILY ONE IS THE

01:33:57.331 --> 01:33:59.333
MESSAGING AROUND THAT SO -- FOR

01:33:59.400 --> 01:34:00.434
THOSE OF US THAT ARE RAISING

01:34:00.501 --> 01:34:01.502
DOLLARS PHILANTHROPIC LEE AND

01:34:01.569 --> 01:34:02.803
CALLING IT A COLLEGE PROMISE AND

01:34:02.870 --> 01:34:03.804
OF COURSE THAT'S THE HISTORY

01:34:03.871 --> 01:34:05.840
GOING BACK TO TWO THOUSAND FIVE

01:34:05.906 --> 01:34:07.408
IN KALAMAZOO MICHIGAN -- WHEN

01:34:07.475 --> 01:34:08.843
ADDITIONAL THINGS BRANDED AS

01:34:08.909 --> 01:34:10.211
COLLEGE PROMISE ENTER THE

01:34:10.277 --> 01:34:11.779
PLAYING FIELD WE HAVE TO FIGURE

01:34:11.846 --> 01:34:13.147
OUT OUR MESSAGING FOR MESSAGING

01:34:13.214 --> 01:34:14.982
HAS TO GET CLEAR -- AND THAT'S

01:34:15.049 --> 01:34:16.017
THE BIGGEST CHALLENGE WERE

01:34:16.083 --> 01:34:16.751
HAVING RIGHT NOW WITH OUR

01:34:16.817 --> 01:34:18.419
PRIVATE BASIS SUPPORT SO WE

01:34:18.486 --> 01:34:18.919
DON'T WANT TO GIVE THE

01:34:18.986 --> 01:34:21.022
IMPRESSION THAT THERE IT'S IT'S

01:34:21.088 --> 01:34:22.323
OVER WE DON'T HAVE TO DO THIS

01:34:22.390 --> 01:34:23.457
PROMISE ANYMORE.

01:34:23.524 --> 01:34:25.059
I'M IN FACT WHAT WE'RE SAYING IS

01:34:25.126 --> 01:34:26.427
THE STATE IS CONTINUING TO

01:34:26.494 --> 01:34:28.229
ASSESS STEP UP AND AND AND OFFER

01:34:28.295 --> 01:34:30.698
NEW SOURCES OF SUPPORT AND THIS

01:34:30.765 --> 01:34:32.833
COR PRIVATELY FUNDED PROMISE IS

01:34:32.900 --> 01:34:35.036
STILL -- WHAT WE'RE ASKING OUR

01:34:35.102 --> 01:34:36.170
COMMUNITY TO DO SO THAT IS A

01:34:36.237 --> 01:34:37.872
WITH IN OUR COMMUNITY THE OTHER

01:34:37.938 --> 01:34:39.240
PIECES OF COURSE THE BRANDING

01:34:39.306 --> 01:34:40.708
AROUND THE COLLEGE IS IT IS IT

01:34:40.775 --> 01:34:42.076
FREE COLLEGE IS A FULL SUPPORT

01:34:42.143 --> 01:34:43.611
IS A TOTAL COSTS ALL THOSE

01:34:43.677 --> 01:34:44.945
DIFFERENT TERMINOLOGIES GET VERY

01:34:45.012 --> 01:34:46.814
CONFUSING TO THE GENERAL PUBLIC

01:34:46.881 --> 01:34:47.014
WHEN?

01:34:47.081 --> 01:34:48.282
THEY'RE TRYING TO SUPPORT THIS --

01:34:48.349 --> 01:34:49.417
AND SO WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO

01:34:49.483 --> 01:34:50.651
IS FIND WAYS TO INTRODUCE THIS

01:34:50.718 --> 01:34:52.453
AS THIS IS WHAT OUR COMMUNITY

01:34:52.520 --> 01:34:53.954
OFFERS THROUGH PHILANTHROPIC

01:34:54.021 --> 01:34:55.723
MEANS -- THIS IS WHAT THE STATE

01:34:55.790 --> 01:34:58.259
IS OFFERING -- WE OFTEN LEAD

01:34:58.325 --> 01:34:59.126
WITH THE FACT THAT YOU KNOW

01:34:59.193 --> 01:35:00.361
CALIFORNIA AND CALIFORNIA

01:35:00.428 --> 01:35:01.529
LEADERSHIP HAS DONE THE BEST IN

01:35:01.595 --> 01:35:03.230
THE ENTIRE NATION ABOUT KEEPING

01:35:03.297 --> 01:35:05.166
FEES LOW WHEN IT COMES TO TO RUN

01:35:05.232 --> 01:35:05.699
MOMENT FEES.

01:35:05.766 --> 01:35:08.002
ON AND STILL FOR MANY STUDENTS

01:35:08.069 --> 01:35:09.670
THAT IS A BARRIER AND THE BIGGER

01:35:09.737 --> 01:35:10.738
BARRIERS ACTUALLY EVERYTHING

01:35:10.805 --> 01:35:12.106
ELSE AND SO IT'S THE EVERYTHING

01:35:12.173 --> 01:35:13.407
ELSE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT WE TALK

01:35:13.474 --> 01:35:17.044
ABOUT COLLEGE PROMISE -- IN OUR

01:35:17.111 --> 01:35:18.612
REGION -- WE ARE LOOKING AT A

01:35:18.679 --> 01:35:19.246
FEW OTHER THINGS WHICH I THINK

01:35:19.313 --> 01:35:19.914
IN THAT IN THE COMING YEARS WHAT

01:35:19.980 --> 01:35:20.514
WILL GET.

01:35:20.581 --> 01:35:22.650
A BETTER HANDLE ON WE WE'RE

01:35:22.716 --> 01:35:23.918
LOOKING AT ADDITIONAL SUPPORTS

01:35:23.984 --> 01:35:26.287
THE AB NINETEEN FUNDS -- AND YOU

01:35:26.353 --> 01:35:27.822
SEEN IN YOUR REPORT THAT THE THE

01:35:27.888 --> 01:35:29.156
THE INCREDIBLE VARIETY OF HOW

01:35:29.223 --> 01:35:31.158
DISTRICTS ARE USING THOSE -- IS

01:35:31.225 --> 01:35:32.960
BOTH A BLESSING AND A BIG

01:35:33.027 --> 01:35:34.495
CHALLENGE BECAUSE WE CAN'T

01:35:34.562 --> 01:35:35.796
MESSAGE THAT ACROSS THE STATE IN

01:35:35.863 --> 01:35:37.498
A SINGLE WAY -- AND THERE'S NO

01:35:37.565 --> 01:35:39.500
THERE IS NO SINGLE EXPLANATION

01:35:39.567 --> 01:35:40.801
FOR WHAT THOSE DOLLARS ARE GOING

01:35:40.868 --> 01:35:41.802
TO WE'RE TRYING TO SAY IS HERE'S

01:36:09.630 --> 01:36:10.898
BLOCK.

01:36:10.965 --> 01:36:13.634
THE THE BLOCK AT RAF HERE AND SO

01:36:13.701 --> 01:36:15.769
I'M JUST CURIOUS FOR ALL SCHOOLS

01:36:15.836 --> 01:36:16.937
IS THIS.

01:36:17.004 --> 01:36:18.739
SIMILAR BECAUSE ACCORDING TO

01:36:18.806 --> 01:36:20.474
THIS THE CALIFORNIA PROMISED

01:36:20.541 --> 01:36:21.842
GRANT IS ABOUT.

01:36:21.909 --> 01:36:23.611
LITTLE UNDER 40% IF I READ IT

01:36:23.677 --> 01:36:25.646
RIGHT A LITTLE UNDER 40% OF THE

01:36:25.713 --> 01:36:27.081
TOTAL COST OF ATTENDANCE.

01:36:27.148 --> 01:36:28.349
I REMEMBER WHEN I WAS IN COLLEGE

01:36:28.415 --> 01:36:29.917
WE REALLY TALKED ABOUT THE TOTAL

01:36:29.984 --> 01:36:31.252
COST OF A TELL ATTENDANCE BUT I

01:36:31.318 --> 01:36:32.820
WORK WITH COLLEGE STUDENTS WE

01:36:32.887 --> 01:36:34.455
DIDN'T JUST TALK ABOUT THE COST

01:36:34.522 --> 01:36:35.456
OF TUITION.

01:36:35.523 --> 01:36:36.924
IS THAT SIMILAR FOR ALL

01:36:36.991 --> 01:36:38.025
DISTRICTS WHERE IT'S SLIGHTLY

01:36:38.092 --> 01:36:39.894
UNDER 40% THAT THAT'S REALLY

01:36:39.960 --> 01:36:42.363
WHAT CALIFORNIA'S FREE COLLEGE

01:36:42.429 --> 01:36:43.430
DOES IT PAYS.

01:36:43.497 --> 01:36:45.666
FOR THAT WERE DOES THAT PERCENT.

01:36:45.733 --> 01:36:47.301
VERY BASED ON REGION.

01:36:47.368 --> 01:36:49.403
I DON'T I EIGHT YEAH IF YOU CAN

01:36:49.470 --> 01:36:51.005
ALL SPEAK TO THAT ANYTHING IS

01:36:51.071 --> 01:36:51.672
THAT RIGHT YEAH I'M IS CERTAINLY

01:36:51.739 --> 01:36:52.673
VERY IS ON RE YOU KNOW OBVIOUSLY

01:36:52.740 --> 01:36:53.974
THE HOUSING COSTS IS THE IS THE

01:36:54.041 --> 01:36:55.643
GREAT VARIABLE THIS BLOCK THEY

01:36:55.709 --> 01:36:56.744
THIS GRAPH HERE DOES NOT SHOW

01:36:56.810 --> 01:36:57.678
THAT SERVICE IS.

01:36:57.745 --> 01:37:00.080
ONLY BE HARD COST OF ATTENDANCE

01:37:00.147 --> 01:37:01.815
SO THIS IS NOT SHOWING -- FOOD

01:37:01.882 --> 01:37:03.584
HOUSING ANYTHING ELSE THIS IS

01:37:03.651 --> 01:37:06.320
JUST THE THE COST OF ATTENDANCE

01:37:06.387 --> 01:37:08.422
BOOKS SUPPLIES FEES IN OUR CASE

01:37:08.489 --> 01:37:10.691
THE THE GREATER VARIABLE HERE IS --

01:37:10.758 --> 01:37:12.826
CERTAIN CD PROGRAM SAY --

01:37:12.893 --> 01:37:14.128
CULINARY OR MARINE DIVING TACTIC

01:37:14.195 --> 01:37:15.629
AND HAVE MUCH HIGHER SUPPLY

01:37:15.696 --> 01:37:17.565
ANOTHER REQUIREMENT COSTS AND

01:37:17.631 --> 01:37:19.066
THEN SAY AND AND ENGLISH

01:37:19.133 --> 01:37:20.367
ASSOCIATES WHICH IS GOING TO BE

01:37:20.434 --> 01:37:22.436
A SMALLER CASA THAT'S ACTUALLY

01:37:22.503 --> 01:37:23.404
GREATER VARIANCE IT'S AVERAGED

01:37:23.470 --> 01:37:25.172
INTO THIS BLOCK IT DOES NOT

01:37:25.239 --> 01:37:26.207
COUNT FOR OTHER COSTS.

01:37:26.273 --> 01:37:27.308
IN THIS LIMóN I WOULD SIMPLY

01:37:27.374 --> 01:37:28.709
ADD THAT ARE FACTORED THE NUMBER

01:37:28.776 --> 01:37:31.178
THAT WE USE IS EIGHTEEN THOUSAND

01:37:31.245 --> 01:37:32.046
FOR FULL COST OF ATTENDANCE.

01:37:32.112 --> 01:37:36.750
AT A COMMITTEE COLLEGE IN LOS

01:37:36.817 --> 01:37:38.185
ANGELES.

01:37:38.252 --> 01:37:39.520
SO OF THAT OF THE EIGHTEEN

01:37:39.587 --> 01:37:40.154
THOUSAND IF THAT'S THE FULL COST

01:37:40.221 --> 01:37:40.754
OF ATTENDANCE WHAT DOES THE

01:37:40.821 --> 01:37:41.655
CALIFORNIA PROMISE ACTUALLY PAY

01:37:41.722 --> 01:37:43.624
FOR WHAT PERCENTAGE OF THAT

01:37:43.691 --> 01:37:44.225
EIGHTEEN THOUSAND BECAUSE IT

01:37:44.291 --> 01:37:45.492
SOUNDS LIKE IT DOESN'T PAY FOR

01:37:45.559 --> 01:37:47.895
ALL EIGHTEEN DOWN -- IT'S 829%.

01:37:47.962 --> 01:37:50.297
IT PAYS 4829% OF THE CORRECT

01:37:50.364 --> 01:37:52.833
THEM BECAUSE THIS THIRTEEN UNDER

01:37:52.900 --> 01:37:54.835
EIGHTY DOLLARS.

01:37:54.902 --> 01:37:58.272
IS IT TOO IS THE FEE WAIVER OUR

01:37:58.339 --> 01:37:59.840
THE FLUFFY.

01:37:59.907 --> 01:38:00.407
EIGHTEEN OUR AND THEN IT WAS

01:38:00.474 --> 01:38:02.243
JUST.

01:38:02.309 --> 01:38:02.943
SIMILAR I'M I THINK THOSE

01:38:03.010 --> 01:38:03.744
PERCENTAGES ARE VERY

01:38:03.811 --> 01:38:04.345
ILLUSTRATIVE OF WHAT YOU'D SEE

01:38:04.411 --> 01:38:05.679
UP IN IN THE STATE AND THAT THE

01:38:05.746 --> 01:38:08.182
TUITION FEE WAIVER IT'S A HURDLE

01:38:08.249 --> 01:38:08.816
BUT IT'S ONLY ONE OF THE HURDLES

01:38:08.882 --> 01:38:09.416
AND I THINK.

01:38:09.483 --> 01:38:10.985
ASISTIR MEAN THIS IS A VERY

01:38:11.051 --> 01:38:13.053
IMPORTANT MOVEMENT LOOKING AT

01:38:13.120 --> 01:38:13.721
THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL ASSEMBLY

01:38:13.787 --> 01:38:15.322
BILL -- TO THERE'S ALSO SENATE

01:38:15.389 --> 01:38:17.358
BILL TWO NINETY ONE THAT'S BEING

01:38:17.424 --> 01:38:18.559
SPENT ON THE OTHER SIDE ABOUT.

01:38:18.626 --> 01:38:21.662
THE MOON THE EXPANSIVE NEEDS AND

01:38:21.729 --> 01:38:22.496
SUPPORTS OUR NEEDS INDUSTRY FOR

01:38:22.563 --> 01:38:23.831
OUR LOW INCOME STUDENTS AND SO

01:38:23.897 --> 01:38:25.833
IT'S NOT ONE POLICY THAT'S GOING

01:38:25.899 --> 01:38:27.101
TO SOLVE ALL THIS BUT I THINK

01:38:27.167 --> 01:38:28.502
PROMISES A VERY IMPORTANT STEP

01:38:28.569 --> 01:38:30.771
BECAUSE IT REMOVES A BARRIER

01:38:30.838 --> 01:38:32.373
TUITION AND IT SIMPLIFIES THE

01:38:32.439 --> 01:38:34.074
THE MESSAGE TO FAMILIES IN

01:38:34.141 --> 01:38:34.508
INCOMING.

01:38:34.575 --> 01:38:35.576
STUDENTS IN THIS POINT

01:38:35.643 --> 01:38:36.944
OUTSOURCING BEAUTIFULLY FROM THE

01:38:37.011 --> 01:38:38.979
SANTA BARBARA EXAMPLE ABLE TO

01:38:39.046 --> 01:38:39.813
LEVERAGE.

01:38:39.880 --> 01:38:40.748
THE COLLEGE PROMISE FOR THE

01:38:40.814 --> 01:38:42.116
TREMENDOUS CIVIC AND

01:38:42.182 --> 01:38:45.252
PHILANTHROPIC SUPPORT.

01:38:45.319 --> 01:38:46.620
US SO THAT THEY CAN.

01:38:46.687 --> 01:38:47.721
THE RALLY AROUND THE NOTION THAT

01:38:47.788 --> 01:38:48.622
EVERY PERSON IN THE COMMUNITY TO

01:38:48.689 --> 01:38:50.057
GO TO COLLEGE SO THAT'S WHAT

01:38:50.124 --> 01:38:51.725
MANY WORK UNITS HAVE DONE IT'S A

01:38:51.792 --> 01:38:52.493
LEVERAGE POINT IT CERTAINLY IS.

01:38:52.559 --> 01:38:56.263
GREAT AND NOW THE SECOND HER IS

01:38:56.330 --> 01:38:57.665
IT THERE HAVE BEEN.

01:38:57.731 --> 01:38:58.866
YOU KNOW SEND SOME DESCRIPTIONS

01:38:58.932 --> 01:39:00.367
OF KIND OF HOW WE CAN ENHANCE

01:39:00.434 --> 01:39:01.835
WHETHER IT'S THE MESSAGING OR

01:39:01.902 --> 01:39:03.637
THE WORK AND YOU'RE IN FRONT OF

01:39:03.704 --> 01:39:05.606
ALL OF US NOW COULD YOU PROVIDE

01:39:05.673 --> 01:39:07.241
SUGGESTIONS I MEAN IT'S JUST

01:39:07.308 --> 01:39:08.309
BEEN IDENTIFIED THAT.

01:39:08.375 --> 01:39:10.144
THERE COULD BE WAYS TO LEVERAGE

01:39:10.210 --> 01:39:12.146
MORE IF WE MESSAGE DAY IN A

01:39:12.212 --> 01:39:13.681
DIFFERENT WAY IF WE'VE PARTNERED

01:39:13.747 --> 01:39:16.116
IN A DIFFERENT WAY WHAT WITH

01:39:16.183 --> 01:39:19.620
THOSE SUGGESTIONS LOOK LIKE.

01:39:19.687 --> 01:39:21.121
YEAH I I MEAN I I WOULD SAY THAT

01:39:21.188 --> 01:39:23.624
THE DEAD PARSING OUT THE TYPES

01:39:23.691 --> 01:39:25.025
OF BARRIERS THE TYPES OF COSTS

01:39:25.092 --> 01:39:26.393
IS USEFUL AND I UNDERSTAND THE

01:39:26.460 --> 01:39:27.594
SIMPLICITY OF A FREE COLLEGE

01:39:27.661 --> 01:39:30.030
MESSAGING -- BUT IT'S ACTUALLY A

01:39:30.097 --> 01:39:31.065
DISSERVICE IN THE LONG RUN

01:39:31.131 --> 01:39:33.067
BECAUSE IT IT GIVES PEOPLE --

01:39:33.133 --> 01:39:34.501
THE IT BAKERIES ASSUMPTIONS

01:39:34.568 --> 01:39:35.336
ABOUT WHAT IS AND WHAT IS NOT

01:39:35.402 --> 01:39:37.338
COVERED -- AND AND HISTORICALLY

01:39:37.404 --> 01:39:38.372
WHEN WE LOOK AT THE WAY COLLEGES

01:39:38.439 --> 01:39:39.640
TALKED ABOUT WE'RE TALKING

01:39:39.707 --> 01:39:41.241
TYPICALLY ABOUT THE TUITION AND

01:39:41.308 --> 01:39:42.543
FEE OR MAYBE ROOM AND BOARD IF

01:39:42.609 --> 01:39:43.477
YOU'RE TALK ABOUT RESIDENTIAL

01:39:43.544 --> 01:39:45.145
FOUR YEAR -- AND SO THIS WAY OF

01:39:45.212 --> 01:39:46.747
TALKING ABOUT COLLEGE ESPECIALLY

01:39:46.814 --> 01:39:47.548
COMMUNITY COLLEGES REALLY

01:39:47.614 --> 01:39:49.116
RELATIVELY NEW ESPECIALLY IN OUR

01:39:49.183 --> 01:39:49.650
COMMUNITIES AND WE HAVE

01:39:49.717 --> 01:39:51.218
GENERATIONS OF STUDENTS THAT ARE

01:39:51.285 --> 01:39:52.553
COLLEGES WHO WHO REMEMBER IT

01:39:52.619 --> 01:39:53.554
DIFFERENTLY TALK ABOUT IT THINK

01:39:53.620 --> 01:39:54.888
ABOUT IT DIFFERENTLY SO IT'S

01:39:54.955 --> 01:39:56.690
REALLY A RETRAINING OF TOTAL

01:39:56.757 --> 01:39:57.558
COSTS.

01:39:57.624 --> 01:39:59.593
MEANS AND THEN WE HAVE TO TALK

01:39:59.660 --> 01:40:00.728
ABOUT THE HOUSING.

01:40:00.794 --> 01:40:02.496
THE FOOD SECURITY AND OF COURSE

01:40:02.563 --> 01:40:03.831
TUITION BOOKS AND IF YOU

01:40:03.897 --> 01:40:05.332
ACTUALLY TEAR THAT -- THAT THE

01:40:05.399 --> 01:40:06.834
MOST USEFUL THING I'VE SEEN ON

01:40:06.900 --> 01:40:08.102
THAT AND AND I'M SURE MY

01:40:08.168 --> 01:40:09.403
COLLEAGUES OF CFC THIS IS THE IS

01:40:09.470 --> 01:40:11.038
TEDIOUS RESEARCH THE INSTITUTE

01:40:11.105 --> 01:40:12.573
FOR COLLEGE ACCESS AND SUCCESS

01:40:12.639 --> 01:40:13.974
AND WHAT THEY DID IS THEY

01:40:14.041 --> 01:40:15.275
COMPILED ALL TOOK.

01:40:15.342 --> 01:40:16.777
ALL IN COSTS OF THE TOTAL COST

01:40:16.844 --> 01:40:18.145
OF ATTENDANCE AND THEN BACKED

01:40:18.212 --> 01:40:19.880
OUT OF PRO RATA SHARE OF WHAT

01:40:19.947 --> 01:40:21.582
FINANCIALLY GRANTED NOT NOT THAT

01:40:21.648 --> 01:40:23.617
IS AVAILABLE -- AND WHAT THEY

01:40:23.684 --> 01:40:25.219
DID IS ESSENTIALLY INVERTED THAT

01:40:25.285 --> 01:40:26.120
THAT HIGHER BECAUSE OF THE

01:40:26.186 --> 01:40:27.254
ASSUMPTION THAT A FOUR YEAR YOU

01:40:27.321 --> 01:40:28.288
YOU SEE.

01:40:28.355 --> 01:40:29.790
IS ACTIVE THE MOST EXPENSIVE IT

01:40:29.857 --> 01:40:31.125
ACTUALLY INVERTS IN MOST REGIONS

01:40:31.191 --> 01:40:32.292
WHERE THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE IS

01:40:32.359 --> 01:40:34.228
THE MOST EXPENSIVE BECAUSE SO

01:40:34.294 --> 01:40:35.529
LITTLE GRANT EIGHT IS AVAILABLE

01:40:35.596 --> 01:40:37.431
SO IN THAT IN THAT CONTEXT THIS

01:40:37.498 --> 01:40:39.099
BECOMES A REALLY VALUABLE TOOL

01:40:39.166 --> 01:40:40.300
AND AND THE LEVERAGING AND

01:40:40.367 --> 01:40:41.502
EVERYTHING YOU CAN DO AROUND IT --

01:40:41.568 --> 01:40:43.570
SO THAT'S THE THAT'S THE

01:40:43.637 --> 01:40:45.572
MESSAGING WE TENDED TO GO.

01:40:45.639 --> 01:40:46.206
FOR I MISSED THE ONE I WOULD ADD

01:40:46.273 --> 01:40:46.874
THAT.

01:40:46.940 --> 01:40:48.709
STILL TO THIS DAY THERE ARE

01:40:48.776 --> 01:40:50.744
STILL MANY COMMUNITIES FAMILIES

01:40:50.811 --> 01:40:52.112
WHO STILL BELIEVE.

01:40:52.179 --> 01:40:53.847
THAT A HIGHER EDUCATION EVEN THE

01:40:53.914 --> 01:40:55.282
COMMITTEE COLLEGE EDUCATION.

01:40:55.349 --> 01:40:56.817
IS STILL OUT OF REACH FOR

01:40:56.884 --> 01:41:00.220
EXAMPLE THIS FALL 57%.

01:41:00.287 --> 01:41:01.522
OF ALL OF OUR NEW ATTENDEES WERE

01:41:01.588 --> 01:41:03.957
FIRST GENERATION IN LOS ANGELES

01:41:04.024 --> 01:41:05.692
IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN SO YOU THINK

01:41:05.759 --> 01:41:07.694
ABOUT THAT ALMOST SIX OUT OF TEN

01:41:07.761 --> 01:41:08.762
SO THEY'RE STILL NEW ENTRIES SO

01:41:08.829 --> 01:41:10.063
WE STILL NEED TO COMMUNICATE.

01:41:10.130 --> 01:41:12.399
THE BENEFITS OF AND OF OF A

01:41:12.466 --> 01:41:14.201
HIGHER EDUCATION TO GOAL LOCAL

01:41:14.268 --> 01:41:15.536
TO GO LOW COST.

01:41:15.602 --> 01:41:22.776
AND REALLY TO EXTEND THE LARGER

01:41:22.843 --> 01:41:23.310
MESSAGE WHICH WE ALL KNOW.

01:41:23.377 --> 01:41:24.745
THAT EDUCATED CITIZENRY IS THE

01:41:24.812 --> 01:41:25.546
WAY TO GO IT IS FIELD

01:41:25.612 --> 01:41:27.080
CALIFORNIA'S ECONOMIC STRAIGHT

01:41:27.147 --> 01:41:27.781
FOR DECADES.

01:41:27.848 --> 01:41:28.449
OF STARTING -- IF YOU WILL WITH

01:41:28.515 --> 01:41:29.082
THAT IN NINETEEN SIXTY WITH THE

01:41:29.149 --> 01:41:29.616
PROLIFERATION OF COLLEGES

01:41:29.683 --> 01:41:32.219
UNIVERSITIES AND INVESTED IN ITS

01:41:32.286 --> 01:41:33.887
INFRASTRUCTURE OF HIGHER

01:41:33.954 --> 01:41:35.355
EDUCATION IN THIS HUMAN CAPITAL

01:41:35.422 --> 01:41:36.156
SO IT'S THE SAME SORT OF

01:41:36.223 --> 01:41:37.825
MESSAGING NOW THAT WE NEED ALL

01:41:37.891 --> 01:41:38.525
PERSONS.

01:41:38.592 --> 01:41:39.893
IN CALIFORNIA TO BE OF

01:41:39.960 --> 01:41:43.230
RESPONSIVE ELIGIBLE FOR AND AND

01:41:43.297 --> 01:41:45.799
ACCOMMODATED THAT AND THEN IN

01:41:45.866 --> 01:41:46.600
HIGHER EDUCATION COMMITTEE

01:41:46.667 --> 01:41:47.434
COLLEGES.

01:41:47.501 --> 01:41:48.035
ARE THE PLACE TO DO THAT WE

01:41:48.101 --> 01:41:50.537
STILL ARE TRYING TO FIND WAYS TO

01:41:50.604 --> 01:41:52.206
FULFILL THE BACCALAUREATE DEGREE

01:41:52.272 --> 01:41:53.507
GAP THAT IS NEEDED TO KEEP

01:41:53.574 --> 01:41:54.508
CALIFORNIA.

01:41:54.575 --> 01:41:57.277
A COMPETITIVE A FEW WELL -- THE

01:41:57.344 --> 01:41:58.245
INVESTMENT THAT IS MAY HAVE YOUR

01:41:58.312 --> 01:41:59.680
KITCHEN IS BY FAR.

01:41:59.746 --> 01:42:02.316
THE BEST INVESTMENT CALIFORNIA

01:42:02.382 --> 01:42:03.150
COULD MAKE.

01:42:03.217 --> 01:42:05.018
WITH RESPECT TO INVEST IN AS

01:42:05.085 --> 01:42:06.854
PEOPLE IT THE ALLEVIATES OTHER

01:42:06.920 --> 01:42:09.656
KINDS OF IT OF IF WE WILL.

01:42:09.723 --> 01:42:11.158
SOCIAL SERVICE SUPPORTS AND

01:42:11.225 --> 01:42:12.659
OTHER THINGS IF WE DON'T EDUCATE

01:42:12.726 --> 01:42:14.661
FOLKS THE COSTS ARE TOO HIGH SO

01:42:14.728 --> 01:42:16.063
THE MESSAGING NEEDS TO BE AROUND

01:42:16.129 --> 01:42:18.599
THE NEED FOR BENEFITS OF AND WHY

01:42:18.665 --> 01:42:19.666
IT MATTERS.

01:42:19.733 --> 01:42:21.368
IN MULTIPLE LANGUAGES SINCE WE

01:42:21.435 --> 01:42:28.242
HAVE A MULTI LINGUAL -- STATE

01:42:28.308 --> 01:42:30.477
BEAUTIFULLY A MULTI LEVEL STATE.

01:42:30.544 --> 01:42:31.778
AND I WAS BRIEFLY ADD TO TO

01:42:31.845 --> 01:42:32.546
MESSAGING THE CONSIDERATIONS.

01:42:32.613 --> 01:42:33.480
I THINK WANT ONE THING THAT'S

01:42:33.547 --> 01:42:34.815
VERY IMPORTANT AS WE'VE BEEN

01:42:34.882 --> 01:42:35.782
ABLE TO GO TO OUR DONORS AT THIS

01:42:35.849 --> 01:42:36.416
POINT AND SAYING THIS THE STATE

01:42:36.483 --> 01:42:37.518
HAVE SKIN IN THIS GAME BUT BUT

01:42:37.584 --> 01:42:38.318
WE NEED MORE.

01:42:38.385 --> 01:42:39.319
TO FINISH THE PUZZLE RIGHT IN

01:42:39.386 --> 01:42:39.920
TERMS OF THIS TOTAL COSTS OF

01:42:39.987 --> 01:42:42.055
ATTENDANCE IN SO I THINK THAT

01:42:42.122 --> 01:42:42.990
THE MORE THE STATE CAN CONTINUE

01:42:43.056 --> 01:42:44.558
TO DO IT ALLOWS US TO GO BACK TO

01:42:44.625 --> 01:42:45.692
THE SAME DONORS AND SAVE.

01:42:45.759 --> 01:42:47.361
THE STATE'S NOW DO YOU KNOW

01:42:47.427 --> 01:42:48.061
ADDED THE SECOND YEAR FOR

01:42:48.128 --> 01:42:49.796
TUITION WE NEED YOUR HELP TO ADD

01:42:49.863 --> 01:42:51.398
A SECOND YOU'RE FOR BOOKS SO I I

01:42:51.465 --> 01:42:52.933
THINK THAT'S ONE THING THAT THAT

01:42:53.000 --> 01:42:54.201
HOPE YOU'RE CONSIDERING --

01:42:54.268 --> 01:42:55.202
CERTAINLY IF YOU WANT ONE

01:42:55.269 --> 01:42:58.305
MESSAGING THING AND I HAVE A

01:42:58.372 --> 01:42:58.872
SOLUTION ON THIS BUT YOU'LL

01:42:58.939 --> 01:43:00.374
NOTICE WE CONSISTENT REFER TO

01:43:00.440 --> 01:43:01.141
THE BORDER GOVERNOR SKI WAIVER

01:43:01.208 --> 01:43:01.675
EVEN THOUGH IT'S BEEN THE

01:43:01.742 --> 01:43:02.476
CALIFORNIA PROMISE GRANT FOR

01:43:02.543 --> 01:43:03.310
NUMBER YEARS.

01:43:03.377 --> 01:43:04.411
AND THAT'S CREATED A LITTLE

01:43:04.478 --> 01:43:06.146
CONFUSION THE MARKET PLACE OUT

01:43:06.213 --> 01:43:07.548
THERE BECAUSE WE HAVE.

TUITION FREE AND WE KNOW WE WILL

01:43:11.485 --> 01:43:12.719
THAT SINCE YOU START FULL TIME

01:43:12.786 --> 01:43:13.654
INCOMPLETE.

01:43:13.720 --> 01:43:15.088
THOSE UNITS ARE MORE LIKELY TO

01:43:15.155 --> 01:43:16.990
SUCCEED IN COMPLETE ON TIME --

01:43:17.057 --> 01:43:18.125
BUT THEN THERE'S THIS OTHER

01:43:18.191 --> 01:43:20.227
PROMISE GRANT THAT'S OUT THERE --

01:43:20.294 --> 01:43:21.461
SO THAT THAT HAS CREATED SOME

01:43:21.528 --> 01:43:22.930
CONFUSION WITH OUR AS SOON

01:43:22.996 --> 01:43:25.132
POPULATIONS ARE FAMILIES -- EVEN

01:43:25.198 --> 01:43:26.567
WITH ARE CANCELING STAFF AND SO

01:43:26.633 --> 01:43:27.701
THAT SOMETHING AS A STATE AT

01:43:27.768 --> 01:43:28.569
SOME POINT WE MIGHT WANT TO

01:43:28.635 --> 01:43:30.003
CONSIDER HOW TO DIFFERENTIATE

01:43:30.070 --> 01:43:34.741
THOSE PROGRAMS -- MORE CLEARLY

01:43:34.808 --> 01:43:35.042
[inaudible]

I WELL WOULD BE I'M NOT SURE

01:43:40.948 --> 01:43:42.149
WHERE WE NEED THE SAME THING

01:43:42.215 --> 01:43:44.351
TWICE BUT THAT'S FOR ANOTHER

01:43:44.418 --> 01:43:45.819
LEGISLATIVE PROPOSAL.

01:43:45.886 --> 01:43:47.087
BUT BUT I I DID WANT TO MENTION

01:43:47.154 --> 01:43:48.255

OR BE TRACKED ANY DATA IS IN

01:44:41.375 --> 01:44:42.876
TOWN OF ONLYHAD THIS FOR ONE

01:44:42.943 --> 01:44:45.312
YEAR NOW BUT SHOWING THAT WE'VE

01:44:45.379 --> 01:44:46.647
HAD.

01:44:46.713 --> 01:44:48.949
YOU KNOW MORE STUDENTS THAN WE

01:44:49.016 --> 01:44:53.253
OTHERWISE WOULD HAVE -- AND AND

01:44:53.320 --> 01:44:55.255
ALSO.

01:44:55.322 --> 01:44:58.291
ON THAT SAME LINE OF THAT SAME

01:44:58.358 --> 01:44:59.660
TRACK THAT YOU HAVE STUDENTS

01:44:59.726 --> 01:45:01.328
WHO'VE COME IN RIGHT NOW UNDER

01:45:01.395 --> 01:45:03.030
THE PROMISE.

01:45:03.096 --> 01:45:05.198
PROGRAM FIRST YEAR WHO ARE.

01:45:05.265 --> 01:45:06.566
SAYING THEY WOULD NOT GO FOR A

01:45:06.633 --> 01:45:10.537
SECOND HERE BECAUSE THE THE FEE

01:45:10.604 --> 01:45:12.172
THE FEES WOULD.

01:45:12.239 --> 01:45:15.175
THEN BE REINSTATED YEAH.

01:45:15.242 --> 01:45:16.710
WE WE HAVE SOME DATA SO WE OURS

01:45:16.777 --> 01:45:18.745
GOES BACK THREE YEARS NOW SO THE

01:45:18.812 --> 01:45:20.480
DATA WE DO HAVE SHOWS UR

01:45:20.547 --> 01:45:22.115
INITIAL PROJECTION BASED ON OUR

01:45:22.182 --> 01:45:23.850
ENROLLMENT -- SO FOR FOR EXAMPLE

01:45:23.917 --> 01:45:25.085
IN OUR LOCAL HIGH SCHOOL

01:45:25.152 --> 01:45:26.620
DISTRICT EIGHT HUNDRED WAS THAT

01:45:26.687 --> 01:45:28.121
THE MEDIAN ENROLLMENT OVER THE

01:45:28.188 --> 01:45:29.556
PRIOR FIVE YEARS.

01:45:29.623 --> 01:45:30.057
EIGHT HUNDRED FIVE SO WE

01:45:30.123 --> 01:45:30.524
PROJECTED OUR PROMISE

01:45:30.590 --> 01:45:32.192
PARTICIPATION BASED ON THAT DATA

01:45:32.259 --> 01:45:34.127
POINT ON WHAT WE DISCOVERED IS

01:45:34.194 --> 01:45:35.395
THAT WHEN YOU OFFER AN

01:45:35.462 --> 01:45:36.563
INCENTIVIZE AND BUILD A

01:45:36.630 --> 01:45:38.031
STRUCTURE LIKE THIS -- YOU OUT

01:45:38.098 --> 01:45:39.399
WE DIDN'T THINK THERE WAS MUCH

01:45:39.466 --> 01:45:42.569
ROOM TO GO UP BECAUSE OUR OUR

01:45:42.636 --> 01:45:43.303
CAPTURE EIGHT IN DISTRICT IS

01:45:43.370 --> 01:45:44.171
ALREADY.

01:45:44.237 --> 01:45:46.239
BASICALLY 50% -- AS IT TURNS OUT

01:45:46.306 --> 01:45:47.574
THERE WAS THERE WAS ROOM SO

01:45:47.641 --> 01:45:48.842
INSTEAD OF HAVING THIRTEEN

01:45:48.909 --> 01:45:49.976
HUNDRED STUDENTS IN THE PROMISE

01:45:50.043 --> 01:45:51.211
AT A TIME WHICH IS WHAT WE

01:45:51.278 --> 01:45:53.413
PROJECTED WHERE AT SEVENTEEN

01:45:53.480 --> 01:45:54.047
HUNDRED WE LOOK AT THE OVERALL

01:45:54.114 --> 01:45:55.549
ENROLLMENT THE SAME THING AND

01:45:55.615 --> 01:45:56.650
ACTUALLY IF YOU LOOK AT THE

01:45:56.717 --> 01:45:58.085
GRAPHS AND THE IN.

01:45:58.151 --> 01:45:59.720
THAT PRESENTATION YOU'LL

01:45:59.786 --> 01:46:01.722
ACTUALLY SEE WE HAD TWO

01:46:01.788 --> 01:46:03.490
SIMULTANEOUS TRENDS SO WE'VE HAD

01:46:03.557 --> 01:46:05.225
FALLING ENROLLMENT FOR TEN YEARS

01:46:05.292 --> 01:46:06.927
IN OUR DISTRICT -- BUT LOCAL

01:46:06.993 --> 01:46:09.129
ENROLLMENT IS ACTUALLY LEVELED

01:46:09.196 --> 01:46:10.397
OUT AND NOW BEGUN TO INCREASE OF

01:46:10.464 --> 01:46:12.332
OUR OVERALL ENROLLMENT IS STILL

01:46:12.399 --> 01:46:14.234
DROPPING -- AND IS A NUMBER OF

01:46:14.301 --> 01:46:15.802
FACTORS WE BELIEVE FOR THAT --

01:46:15.869 --> 01:46:17.037
INCLUDING OF THE PROLIFERATION

01:46:17.104 --> 01:46:18.071
OF PROMISE EFFORTS KEEPING FOLKS

01:46:18.138 --> 01:46:20.140
MORE LOCAL -- BUT WE'RE ACTUALLY

01:46:20.207 --> 01:46:21.475
SEEING AN INCREASE OF A

01:46:21.541 --> 01:46:23.777
CONSIDERABLE INCREASE CLOSE

01:46:23.844 --> 01:46:25.912
2215% IN OUR LOCAL DISTRICT.

01:46:25.979 --> 01:46:27.814
MISTER GELLER EFFECT ON AT ON

01:46:27.881 --> 01:46:29.382
THE LOS ANGELES STORY.

01:46:29.449 --> 01:46:31.251
IS ALSO A GOOD STORY WHILE

01:46:31.318 --> 01:46:32.886
OVERALL THE ROMANS A LITTLE SOFT

01:46:32.953 --> 01:46:34.588
IN THE OR STOP THE STATEWIDE WE

01:46:34.654 --> 01:46:36.156
SOLVED OVERALL INCREASE.

01:46:36.223 --> 01:46:38.859
OF 24% FROM OUR LA U. S. THE

01:46:38.925 --> 01:46:42.295
STUDENT GRADUATES OVER TWO YEARS.

01:46:42.362 --> 01:46:42.963
TO LACC THE AND THAT'S

01:46:43.029 --> 01:46:44.064
SIGNIFICANT TO PUT THAT IN

01:46:44.131 --> 01:46:47.067
NUMBERS WE HAD FOUR THOUSAND

01:46:47.134 --> 01:46:47.701
SIXTY THREE STUDENTS PARTICIPATE

01:46:47.768 --> 01:46:48.702
YEAR.

01:46:48.769 --> 01:46:50.704
ONE THIS WAS BEFORE AB NINETEEN

01:46:50.771 --> 01:46:51.805
WAS ENACTED IN WITH AB NINETEEN

01:46:51.872 --> 01:46:53.607
AT FIFTY FOUR HUNDRED IN THE

01:46:53.673 --> 01:46:54.975
SECOND YEAR AND WE'RE MOVING

01:46:55.041 --> 01:46:56.409
TOWARDS.

01:46:56.476 --> 01:46:58.512
TEN THOUSAND BY TWENTY TWENTY

01:46:58.578 --> 01:47:00.213
TWO SO THAT IS SOMETHING THAT

01:47:00.280 --> 01:47:01.047
WE'RE MOVING TOWARDS OF THE

01:47:01.114 --> 01:47:01.615
ANSWER IS YES.

01:47:01.681 --> 01:47:02.616
WITH THESE STUDENTS HAVE

01:47:02.682 --> 01:47:04.017
OTHERWISE COME WELL WE'RE IN.

01:47:04.084 --> 01:47:05.218
THE LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL

01:47:05.285 --> 01:47:11.591
DISTRICT COLLEGE GOING RATE IS

01:47:11.658 --> 01:47:12.759
60%.

01:47:12.826 --> 01:47:14.361
PUT IT IN DIFFERENT TERMS 40% OF

01:47:14.427 --> 01:47:15.562
LA U. S. THE STUDENTS TO NOT GO

01:47:15.629 --> 01:47:16.163
TO COLLEGE.

01:47:16.229 --> 01:47:17.130
THAT IS UNACCEPTABLE.

01:47:17.197 --> 01:47:18.198
THIS PROGRAM ALLOWS US AN

01:47:18.265 --> 01:47:19.399
INTERVENTION TO INCREASE THE

01:47:19.466 --> 01:47:20.066

AMELIORATE.

01:48:34.841 --> 01:48:36.009
THAT ISSUE THAT'S WHY ELLIE U.

SEPARATE WITH CHANGING THE LIVES

01:48:41.648 --> 01:48:42.549

01:48:47.454 --> 01:48:49.289
MISNOMER BECAUSE IT'S NOT THE

01:48:49.356 --> 01:48:52.092
TUITION IT'S YOUR POINTS 90%.

01:48:52.158 --> 01:48:54.060
OF COLLEGE IS NOT THE COMMUNITY

01:48:54.127 --> 01:48:56.663
COLLEGE TUITION BUT IT'S A HOOK

01:48:56.730 --> 01:48:58.031
IT'S FOR HER TO GET THE STUDENTS

01:48:59.633 --> 01:49:01.067
YOU FEEL THAT'S A LITTLE BIT.

01:49:01.134 --> 01:49:02.202
DECEITFUL BECAUSE THEY'RE

01:49:02.269 --> 01:49:03.770
SHOWING UP NAY HEY WHERE'S THE

01:49:03.837 --> 01:49:04.938

EVERYTHING NO SIR NOTHING JUST

01:49:08.341 --> 01:49:09.309
ADD ON TO THAT BECAUSE I THINK

01:49:09.376 --> 01:49:09.776
IS IS IS.

01:49:09.843 --> 01:49:11.344

OR YOU CAN STATE YOU KNOW MAYBE

01:49:16.850 --> 01:49:18.418
MAYBE IT IS MORE AFFORDABLE

01:49:18.485 --> 01:49:20.153
HOUSING SITUATION RATHER THAN

01:49:20.220 --> 01:49:22.222
HAVING TO GO.

01:49:22.289 --> 01:49:24.491
TO ANOTHER PLACE RIGHT AND AND

01:49:24.557 --> 01:49:26.059
AND WERE HOUSING MIGHT BE MORE

01:49:26.126 --> 01:49:27.027
EXPENSIVE IS THAT I MEAN WHAT IF

01:49:27.093 --> 01:49:27.694
I COULD JUST ADD SOME INTO BOTH

01:49:27.761 --> 01:49:29.729
YOUR COMMENTS -- IT DEFINITELY

01:49:29.796 --> 01:49:31.431
IS A HOOK TO YOUR COMMENT ABOUT

01:49:31.498 --> 01:49:32.265
WHAT OUR STUDENTS SAYING ABOUT

01:49:32.332 --> 01:49:33.133
THE NEXT YEAR THAT'S DEFINITELY

01:49:33.199 --> 01:49:34.567
SOMETHING WE'RE HEARING

01:49:34.634 --> 01:49:36.002
ANECDOTALLY FROM STUDENTS --

01:49:36.069 --> 01:49:37.771
OKAY I GOT AND I GOT THIS FIRST

01:49:37.837 --> 01:49:39.306
YEAR WHAT'S AVAILABLE TO ME NOW

01:49:39.372 --> 01:49:40.507
SOME OF THE SINCE WILL QUALIFY

01:49:40.573 --> 01:49:41.174
BOARD GOVERNOR'S VIEW WAIVER WE

01:49:41.241 --> 01:49:42.375
HAVE A SCHOLARSHIP AND SUPPORT

01:49:42.442 --> 01:49:43.710
PROGRAMS ON CAMPUS.

01:49:43.777 --> 01:49:45.145
BUT IT'S ENOUGH TO GET ME IN THE

01:49:45.211 --> 01:49:47.180
DOOR IT'S A HOOK BUT IT'S NOT

01:49:47.247 --> 01:49:48.014
ENOUGH TO REALLY GIVE ME A GOOD

01:49:48.081 --> 01:49:49.449
CHANCE A COMPLETION AND SO

01:49:49.516 --> 01:49:50.917
THAT'S WHY I THINK THE SECOND

01:49:50.984 --> 01:49:51.351
YEAR.

01:49:51.418 --> 01:49:53.253

ALIGNMENT THERE WITH YOUR OTHER

01:50:08.868 --> 01:50:10.170

THIS ONE SO.

01:50:11.705 --> 01:50:12.272
I THINK THAT'S VERY IMPORTANT I

01:50:12.339 --> 01:50:13.239
THINK THE MORE THE STATE COULD

01:50:13.306 --> 01:50:13.773
DO FOR TUITION AND FEES.

01:50:13.840 --> 01:50:14.374
THE MORE WE COULD DO WITH OUR

01:50:14.441 --> 01:50:15.241
LOCAL COMMUNITIES AND OUR

01:53:19.526 --> 01:53:20.660
FLEXIBILITY I MENTIONED EARLIER

01:53:20.727 --> 01:53:22.262
IS BOTH A BLESSING AND A CURSE

01:53:22.328 --> 01:53:23.830
FOR US AND I THINK THE THE

01:53:23.897 --> 01:53:25.899
MATCHING OF OF WHAT WE'RE DOING

01:53:25.965 --> 01:53:27.000
AND HOW WE'RE DOING IT IS THE

01:53:27.066 --> 01:53:28.334
KID IS THE KEY CHALLENGE SO WE

01:53:28.401 --> 01:53:29.669
ARE DISTRICT FOR EXAMPLE THAT IS

01:53:29.736 --> 01:53:29.903
STILL.

01:53:29.969 --> 01:53:31.237
HAVING A CONVERSATION ABOUT HOW

01:53:31.304 --> 01:53:33.273
THOSE A. B. NINETEEN DOLLARS GET

01:53:33.339 --> 01:53:35.275
EXPANDED -- WE WOULDN'T BE THERE

01:53:35.341 --> 01:53:36.442
HAD IT NOT BEEN FOR THE FACT

01:53:36.509 --> 01:53:37.410
THAT WE ARE PRE EXISTING TWO

01:53:37.477 --> 01:53:38.811
YEAR PRIVATELY FUNDED PROMISE

01:53:38.878 --> 01:53:39.546
EFFORT.

01:53:39.612 --> 01:53:41.014
AND SO I THINK THE THE

01:53:41.080 --> 01:53:42.615
FLEXIBILITY IS GOOD ALTHOUGH THE

01:53:42.682 --> 01:53:44.551
IDEAL FOR US WOULD BE THAT THAT

01:53:44.617 --> 01:53:46.653
THE THE LEGISLATURE WOULD PROVE

01:53:46.719 --> 01:53:48.087
THE FUNDS TO ACTUALLY.

01:53:48.154 --> 01:53:49.656
BUY OUT THOSE FEES ACROSS THE

01:53:49.722 --> 01:53:51.491
BOARD AND SIMPLIFY THAT SO THAT

01:53:51.558 --> 01:53:54.561
AS AS WE WE MENTIONED EARLIER

01:53:54.627 --> 01:53:55.828
YOU WITH THE CREATIVITY THAT THE

01:53:55.895 --> 01:53:57.330
THAT THE PRIVATE PHILANTHROPIC

01:53:57.397 --> 01:53:59.666
DOLLARS CAN CAN ADD TO THAT --

01:53:59.732 --> 01:54:01.067
WOULD BE THE GOAL SO I WOULD SAY

01:54:01.134 --> 01:54:02.902
IF IF WE COULD DO ANYTHING IT

01:54:02.969 --> 01:54:04.237
WOULD BE TO MAKE THAT A SIMPLE.

01:54:04.304 --> 01:54:07.373
FORMULA -- AND THEN TO USE THE

01:54:07.440 --> 01:54:08.608
PHILANTHROPIC DOLLARS TO BE THE

01:54:08.675 --> 01:54:10.543
OUT ON THIS -- AT THIS POINT

01:54:10.610 --> 01:54:11.878
THOSE ARE NOT REPLACEABLE AND

01:54:11.945 --> 01:54:13.446
THAT YOU KNOW THAT WAS CLARIFIED

01:54:13.513 --> 01:54:15.048
EARLY ON A. B. NINETEEN THE

01:54:15.114 --> 01:54:16.115
CHANCES OFFICE THAT IF YOU

01:54:16.182 --> 01:54:17.584
ALREADY HAVE A A PROGRAM --

01:54:17.650 --> 01:54:19.052
THESE DOLLARS MAYBE NINETY

01:54:19.118 --> 01:54:21.087
CANNOT BE USED TO BUY THAT OUT

01:54:21.154 --> 01:54:23.056
AND THEN AND THEN YOU MOVE ON

01:54:23.122 --> 01:54:24.390
ULTIMATELY IF THIS IS SOLIDIFIED

01:54:24.457 --> 01:54:25.758
AS AN ONGOING FUNDING SOURCE I

01:54:25.825 --> 01:54:26.693
WOULD ARGUE THAT WE SHOULD BE

01:54:26.759 --> 01:54:28.228
ABLE TO DO THAT BECAUSE THEN WE

01:54:28.294 --> 01:54:28.628
CAN GET.

01:54:28.695 --> 01:54:30.296
THOSE OTHER DOLLARS APPLIED TO

01:54:30.363 --> 01:54:31.431
THINGS LIKE HOUSING AND SECURITY

01:54:31.497 --> 01:54:33.233
FOOD AND SECURITY OTHER KINDS OF

01:54:33.299 --> 01:54:34.100
BRIDGE BUILDING AT SOME

01:54:34.167 --> 01:54:35.835
CLARIFICATION FROM THE

01:54:35.902 --> 01:54:37.570
CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE AS FAR AS IT

01:54:37.637 --> 01:54:41.741
WHAT THE ISSUE HE'S RAISING IS

01:54:41.808 --> 01:54:43.009
THAT.

01:54:43.076 --> 01:54:44.077
CURRENTLY PERMISSIBLE HELP HELP

01:54:44.143 --> 01:54:44.711

01:54:44.777 --> 01:54:45.712
HERE.

THANK YOU WE HAVE -- WE'VE GIVEN

01:54:47.380 --> 01:54:48.715
DISTRICTS BROUGHT FLEXIBILITY

01:54:48.781 --> 01:54:51.284
SIDE I DON'T WANT TO CONTRADICT

01:54:51.351 --> 01:54:52.318
ANYTHING MY COLLEAGUES HAVE

01:54:52.385 --> 01:54:53.486

LAW TO USE IT -- FOR FEE WAIVERS.

01:55:06.132 --> 01:55:07.734
WELL I WOULD ONLY ADD FROM A

01:55:07.800 --> 01:55:09.302
POLICY PERSPECTIVE.

01:55:09.369 --> 01:55:10.770
BECAUSE THERE IS IMPACTION AT

01:55:10.837 --> 01:55:11.404

SEATS AVAILABLE TO THEM HAS SOME

01:55:20.179 --> 01:55:21.648
KIND OF FORMAL WAY.

HAVE -- NEED TO DO WORK THINKING

01:57:07.854 --> 01:57:09.756
ABOUT HOW WE WOULD MAKE SURE

01:57:09.822 --> 01:57:11.491
THAT STUDENTS ART A FEW DO NOT

01:57:11.557 --> 01:57:12.558
MEET THAT REQUIREMENT OR NOT

01:57:12.625 --> 01:57:13.993
OTHERWISE GETTING FEE WAIVERS I

01:57:14.060 --> 01:57:16.028
THINK THE ISSUE IS THAT OF THE

01:57:16.095 --> 01:57:17.330
TWO MILLION COMMUNITY COLLEGE

01:57:17.397 --> 01:57:19.565

01:57:19.632 --> 01:57:21.134
THOUSAND YOU SEE AN FIVE

01:57:21.200 --> 01:57:22.135
THOUSAND CSU.

01:57:22.201 --> 01:57:24.837
IT'S NOT ALL LINEAR PERFECT

01:57:24.904 --> 01:57:26.539
EVERYONE HAS THE SAME TRACK

01:57:26.606 --> 01:57:28.408
RIGHT IN ALL OF US HAD HAD

01:57:28.474 --> 01:57:31.944
DIFFERENT A PATH TO TO GET WERE

01:57:32.011 --> 01:57:32.945
RAT TODAY.

01:57:33.012 --> 01:57:35.047
AND SO AS WE PUT THESE PROGRAMS --

01:57:35.114 --> 01:57:37.116
FOURTH WE NEED TO FIGURE OUT YOU

01:57:37.183 --> 01:57:40.286
KNOW HOW WE DON'T HAVE STUDENTS.

01:57:40.353 --> 01:57:42.522
TRAPPED AND WE HAVE HOW WE HAVE --

01:57:42.588 --> 01:57:44.323
FLEXIBILITY IN THIS I THINK I

01:57:44.390 --> 01:57:45.258
THINK THAT'S WHAT WE'RE LOOKING

01:57:45.324 --> 01:57:46.559
AT AND I DON'T KNOW THE ANSWER

01:57:46.626 --> 01:57:48.728
RIGHT HERE TODAY BUT AS WE LOOK

01:57:48.795 --> 01:57:49.996
AT EXPAND.

01:57:50.062 --> 01:57:51.497
THIS THIS PROMISE PROGRAM IS IS

01:57:51.564 --> 01:57:52.799
WHAT.

01:57:52.865 --> 01:57:55.101
CAN WE DO TO ADDRESS THE ISSUES

01:57:55.168 --> 01:57:55.701
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

01:57:55.768 --> 01:57:56.502
TODAY.

01:57:56.569 --> 01:57:57.703
IF I COULD ADD ONE ONE

01:57:57.770 --> 01:57:59.439
SUGGESTION FROM A POLICY

01:57:59.505 --> 01:58:00.873
STANDPOINT IMPROVE THIS IS.

01:58:00.940 --> 01:58:02.842
I THINK RIGHT NOW WE HAVE A

01:58:02.909 --> 01:58:03.509
HUNDRED FIFTEEN DIFFERENT

01:58:03.576 --> 01:58:04.377
MESSAGES GOING OUT ABOUT

01:58:04.444 --> 01:58:05.611
PROMISES ME AND I THINK ONE

01:58:05.678 --> 01:58:06.846
THING THAT WE CAN LEARN FROM

01:58:06.913 --> 01:58:08.247
WHAT ORGANS DONE IN TENNESSEE IS

01:58:08.314 --> 01:58:09.048
DONE.

01:58:09.115 --> 01:58:11.217
IS MORE A UNIVERSAL MESSAGE IT'S

01:58:11.284 --> 01:58:12.718
COMING I KNOW I KNOW THERE'S A

01:58:12.785 --> 01:58:13.786
PROPOSED IF FOR SOME SUPPORT FOR

01:58:13.853 --> 01:58:15.621
THIS UNIVERSAL MESSAGES COMING

01:58:15.688 --> 01:58:17.190
FROM THE STATE LEVEL ABOUT THIS

01:58:17.256 --> 01:58:18.658
ACCESS TO TUITION WILL STILL

01:58:18.724 --> 01:58:20.293
WANT TO HAVE OUR LOCAL MESSAGING.

01:58:20.359 --> 01:58:21.527
BUT SOMETHING THAT GETS THE WORD

01:58:21.594 --> 01:58:23.329
OUT TO YOU STUDENTS PARENTS

01:58:23.396 --> 01:58:25.832
FAMILIES -- TAXPAYERS PEOPLE

01:58:25.898 --> 01:58:27.099
THROUGHOUT THE STATE THAT THIS

01:58:27.166 --> 01:58:28.634
IS AVAILABLE TO OUR STUDENTS NOW

01:58:28.701 --> 01:58:30.069
IN WHATEVER THE CONSISTENT

01:58:30.136 --> 01:58:31.437
ELEMENT OF IT IS IF IT'S FEE

01:58:31.504 --> 01:58:33.239
WAIVER FOR THAT'S CONSISTENT

01:58:33.306 --> 01:58:34.140
ACROSS THE STATE.

01:58:34.207 --> 01:58:35.675
THAT CAN NOW LIMIT IN THAT YOU

01:58:35.741 --> 01:58:36.976
KNOW INDIVIDUAL BENEFITS MAY

01:58:37.043 --> 01:58:38.845
VARY BY CAMPUS I THINK WE COULD

01:58:38.911 --> 01:58:40.112
BE MORE EFFICIENT WITH OUR

01:58:40.179 --> 01:58:41.414
DOLLARS AND MORE EFFICIENT WITH

01:58:41.481 --> 01:58:44.984
OUR MESSAGING IF WE HAD MORE

01:58:45.051 --> 01:58:47.186
CENTRALIZED EFFORT.

01:58:47.253 --> 01:58:48.488
INCLUDE F. EXCUSE ME WHY IT

01:58:48.554 --> 01:58:49.422
MATTERS.

01:58:49.489 --> 01:58:50.256
WHY IT MATTERS CALIFORNIA HAS

01:58:50.323 --> 01:58:51.290
THE ABILITY TO RADICALLY THE

01:58:51.357 --> 01:58:51.757
TREMENDOUS WEALTH AND

01:58:51.824 --> 01:58:53.359
OPPORTUNITY GAP THAT EXISTS IN

01:58:53.426 --> 01:58:55.061
OUR COMMUNITIES THROUGH A

01:58:55.127 --> 01:58:56.496
PROGRAM SUCH AS THIS?

01:58:56.562 --> 01:58:57.296
THROUGH OUR CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY

01:58:57.363 --> 01:58:59.031
COLLEGES BUT THAT'S A REALLY

01:58:59.098 --> 01:58:59.999
APPOINTMENTS NOT JUST TO GET IT

01:59:00.066 --> 01:59:00.733
BUT WHY IT MATTERS TO BE

01:59:00.800 --> 01:59:02.668
EDUCATED TO BE ELIGIBLE FOR

01:59:02.735 --> 01:59:03.836
PARTICIPATE IN.

01:59:03.903 --> 01:59:04.770
OF THE GIG ECONOMY THE

01:59:04.837 --> 01:59:06.539
INNOVATION ECONOMY THOSE OTHER

01:59:06.606 --> 01:59:07.940
TREMENDOUS ASSETS THAT

01:59:08.007 --> 01:59:09.675
CALIFORNIA HAS A WITHOUT THESE

01:59:09.742 --> 01:59:11.077
KINDS OF OPPORTUNITIES WE ARE

01:59:11.143 --> 01:59:13.746
BUILDING A PERPETUATING -- A

01:59:13.813 --> 01:59:16.349
SINGLE A WEALTH DISPARITY THAT

01:59:16.415 --> 01:59:19.552
THAT WE CAN NO LONGER SUSTAIN SO.

01:59:19.619 --> 01:59:23.823
YOU KNOW MY MESSED IT UP I'D I'D

01:59:23.890 --> 01:59:24.624
LIKE TO INCLUDE -- WILL.

01:59:24.690 --> 01:59:25.791
IN YOUR **** THE CONSIDERATION

01:59:25.858 --> 01:59:26.726
OF THE MESSAGING WHY IT MATTERS

01:59:26.792 --> 01:59:28.361
FOR CALIFORNIA AND WHY IT

01:59:28.427 --> 01:59:29.996
MATTERS IN THE EQUITY EQUATION.

01:59:30.062 --> 01:59:31.797
OKAY YES MISTER MCCARTY AYE I

01:59:31.864 --> 01:59:33.432
KNOW YOU KNOW THIS SO I HESITATE

01:59:33.499 --> 01:59:34.634
TO JUMP IN BUT I WOULD JUST SAY

01:59:34.700 --> 01:59:36.469
YOU KNOW -- I THINK AS WE THINK

01:59:36.536 --> 01:59:38.271
ABOUT EXPANDING THIS -- YOU KNOW

01:59:38.337 --> 01:59:40.873
TODAY WE COLLECT ABOUT FOUR

01:59:40.940 --> 01:59:41.774
HUNDRED THIRTY FIVE MILLION --

01:59:41.841 --> 01:59:43.776
AND FEES SO -- YOU KNOW THE

01:59:43.843 --> 01:59:45.845
GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED ESSENTIALLY --

01:59:45.912 --> 01:59:47.313
EIGHTEEN AN INCREASE DECREASE IN

01:59:47.380 --> 01:59:48.281
THAT AMOUNT BY ABOUT FORTY

01:59:48.347 --> 01:59:50.116
MILLION I THINK LARGER

01:59:50.182 --> 01:59:51.584
EXPANSIONS.

01:59:51.651 --> 01:59:53.019
YOU KNOW WE'VE COST ABOUT AN

01:59:53.085 --> 01:59:55.288
ESTIMATE OF ABOUT A HUNDRED

01:59:55.354 --> 01:59:56.822
MILLION DOLLARS MORE TO WAIVE

01:59:56.889 --> 01:59:59.692
TUITION FOR NON FIRST TIME

01:59:59.759 --> 02:00:01.260
STUDENTS WHO ARE FULL TIME.

02:00:01.327 --> 02:00:02.328
I THINK THE YOU KNOW.

02:00:02.395 --> 02:00:04.697
THE RULES OF THE GAME FOR THE

02:00:04.764 --> 02:00:06.432
PAST THIRTY YEARS HAS BEEN WE WE

02:00:06.499 --> 02:00:08.200
FUND COMMUNITY COLLEGES AT THE

02:00:08.267 --> 02:00:10.403
LEVEL REQUIRED BY PROP NINETY

02:00:10.469 --> 02:00:11.370
EIGHT WE WOULD ARGUE THAT

02:00:11.437 --> 02:00:12.638
SHOULDN'T BE THE RULES OF THE

02:00:12.705 --> 02:00:14.307
GAME BUT TO THE EXTENT TO THOSE

02:00:14.373 --> 02:00:16.609
REMAIN THE RULES THAT I THINK WE

02:00:16.676 --> 02:00:16.909
IT I THINK.

02:00:16.976 --> 02:00:18.444
THERE ARE HARD QUESTIONS ABOUT

02:00:18.511 --> 02:00:19.845
WHERE THOSE STOP THOSE DOLLARS

02:00:19.912 --> 02:00:20.846
DON'T GET BACK FILLED IN THE

02:00:20.913 --> 02:00:22.148
COMMUNITY COLLEGES BUDGET SO

02:00:22.214 --> 02:00:24.250
WHAT WE DO TO SUPPORT THE COST

02:00:24.317 --> 02:00:25.851
THAT I THINK ARE VERY REAL.

02:00:25.918 --> 02:00:27.053
FOR FULL TIME FACULTY FOR OTHER

02:00:27.119 --> 02:00:29.322
COSTS THAT WE ALSO KNOW IMPROVE

02:00:29.388 --> 02:00:33.392
STUDENT SUCCESS OF OTHER

02:00:33.459 --> 02:00:34.760
CULTURES.

02:00:34.827 --> 02:00:35.428
AND I I WOULD SEPARATE THIS SORT

02:00:35.494 --> 02:00:36.062
OF EXPERIMENTAL PHASE FROM THE

02:00:36.128 --> 02:00:36.629
OTHER SO MIGHT MY COMMENT

02:00:36.696 --> 02:00:37.263
EARLIER ABOUT THE BLESSING AND

02:00:37.330 --> 02:00:38.197
CURSE OF THAT FLEXIBILITY IS

02:00:38.264 --> 02:00:39.298
THAT RIGHT NOW THAT'S BEEN A

02:00:39.365 --> 02:00:40.800
BLESSING TO BE ABLE. TO TO

02:00:40.866 --> 02:00:43.102
FIGURE IT OUT -- THE CURBSIDE IS

02:00:43.169 --> 02:00:44.470
THAT COMMUNICATION SIDE AND WHEN

02:00:44.537 --> 02:00:45.838
ONCE WE'RE CLEAR ON THIS AND

02:00:45.905 --> 02:00:47.807
THERE IS A LONG TERM FUNDING AT

02:00:47.873 --> 02:00:49.508
WHATEVER LEVEL OF WEEK WE END UP

02:00:49.575 --> 02:00:51.177
THAT I WOULD SAY SIMPLICITY IS

02:00:51.243 --> 02:00:53.412
IS KEY -- I WE WE'VE FOUND THE

02:00:53.479 --> 02:00:54.547
OF FORM FOLLOWS FUNCTION

02:00:54.614 --> 02:00:55.815
STRUCTURE AND AN INCENTIVE

02:00:55.881 --> 02:00:57.316
STRUCTURES CRITICAL SO WHATEVER

02:00:57.383 --> 02:00:59.151
WE LAND ON WE NEED TO MAKE THAT

02:00:59.218 --> 02:01:00.586
A SIMPLE AS POSSIBLE RATHER THAN

02:01:00.653 --> 02:01:02.655
A NEW PROGRAM OR NEW APPLICATION.

02:01:02.722 --> 02:01:04.390
SIMPLY USE THE STRONGEST PARTS

02:01:04.457 --> 02:01:05.691
OF THE SYSTEM AS THEY ARE

02:01:05.758 --> 02:01:07.893
BOLSTER THOSE AND THEN AND LET

02:01:07.960 --> 02:01:08.995
THOSE YOU KNOW EXPERIMENTS

02:01:09.061 --> 02:01:10.830
AROUND THE THE MARGINS OR WITH

02:01:10.896 --> 02:01:12.365
PHILANTHROPIC DOLLARS --

02:01:12.431 --> 02:01:13.699
CONTINUE TO PUSH FORWARD BUT

02:01:13.766 --> 02:01:15.001
THAT THAT TO ME IS WHERE WE NEED

02:01:15.067 --> 02:01:17.536
TO GOES AT THAT SIMPLE CLEAR

02:01:17.603 --> 02:01:18.304
THIS IS WHAT WE DO THIS IS WHY

02:01:18.371 --> 02:01:19.071
WE DO IT.

02:01:19.138 --> 02:01:21.140
AND AND GIVE IT AND AND LET THE

02:01:21.207 --> 02:01:22.375
FLEXIBILITY THEN COME AND AT AT

02:01:22.441 --> 02:01:24.143
THE WITH WITH OTHER SORT OF

02:01:24.210 --> 02:01:25.511
EXPERIMENTS ON THE MARGINS.

02:01:25.578 --> 02:01:27.213
AND THEN DO YOU HAVE THE

02:01:27.279 --> 02:01:29.782
FLEXIBILITY TO USE SOME OF YOUR

02:01:29.849 --> 02:01:35.454
YOUR CAMPUS MONEY. TO FOCUS ON

02:01:35.521 --> 02:01:38.324
THE FOR FOR THAT FOR THE NON

02:01:38.391 --> 02:01:40.459
FIRST TIME STUDENTS WE DO. TWO

02:01:40.526 --> 02:01:41.894
OTHER FUNDS SOURCES CORRECT YEAH

02:01:41.961 --> 02:01:42.662
BECAUSE IT WAS OUR

02:01:42.728 --> 02:01:45.064
RESPONSIBILITY TO SUPPORT ALL

02:01:45.131 --> 02:01:45.665
STUDENTS WHO ARE THERE SO THAT

02:01:45.731 --> 02:01:47.667
IS CORRECT.

02:01:47.733 --> 02:01:48.668
YEAH AND THERE'S FLEXIBILITY IN

02:01:48.734 --> 02:01:50.336
THE STUDENT EQUITY IN ACCESS

02:01:50.403 --> 02:01:52.238
FUNDS YEAH BUT TO DO THAT WHAT

02:01:52.304 --> 02:01:53.406
ABOUT JUST GET TO THE OFFICE

02:01:53.472 --> 02:01:55.274
WITH THE STATE MONEY.

02:01:55.341 --> 02:01:55.941
IT IS IT WOULD HAVE THE FACT BUT

02:01:56.008 --> 02:01:56.776
I'M I KNOW THAT'S NOT ENOUGH TO

02:01:56.842 --> 02:01:57.576
GO AROUND OBVIOUSLY.

02:01:57.643 --> 02:01:59.512
BUT WOULD THEY HAVE A CASE BY

02:01:59.578 --> 02:02:03.582
CASE SITUATION OR HOW WOULD THAT

02:02:03.649 --> 02:02:04.817
WORK WE HAVE LONG STATE.

02:02:04.884 --> 02:02:06.218
STATURE REQUIRES COLLEGES TO

02:02:06.285 --> 02:02:06.886
COLLECT THE ENROLLMENT FEE -- I

02:02:06.952 --> 02:02:07.553
THINK THERE'S BEEN LONGSTANDING

02:02:07.620 --> 02:02:09.755
INTERPRETATION THAT SUGGESTS

02:02:09.822 --> 02:02:12.324
THAT -- USING STATE GENERAL

02:02:12.391 --> 02:02:14.727
FUNDS WERE UP TO PAY ENROLLMENT

02:02:14.794 --> 02:02:16.395
FEES WHO ARE NOT OTHERWISE --

02:02:16.462 --> 02:02:18.464
FOR HIM BUT ROAMING FEES ARE NOT

02:02:18.531 --> 02:02:20.232
OTHERWISE WAVE WOULD BE -- IS

02:02:20.299 --> 02:02:21.634
NOT ALLOWED UNDER THOSE LAWS

02:02:21.701 --> 02:02:23.536
WITHIN CLARIFICATION ABOUT

02:02:23.602 --> 02:02:26.072
WHETHER COLLEGES CAN USE GENERAL --

02:02:26.138 --> 02:02:29.208
FUNDS TO PAY ENROLLMENT FEES

02:02:29.275 --> 02:02:30.676
WOULD BE -- WOULD BE HELPFUL.

02:02:30.743 --> 02:02:31.944
AND THAT THE ONLY THING I WOULD

02:02:32.011 --> 02:02:33.245
ADD TO THAT SORT OF THE AS THE

02:02:33.312 --> 02:02:34.113
AS THE PHILANTHROPY GUY HERE

02:02:34.180 --> 02:02:35.748
TODAY WHO WHO'S WHO'S WORKING

02:02:35.815 --> 02:02:37.216
PRIMARILY ON THAT PRIVATE

02:02:37.283 --> 02:02:38.984
SUPPORT SIDE YOU KNOW IT

02:02:39.051 --> 02:02:39.785
PHILANTHROPY IN THE COMMITTEE

02:02:39.852 --> 02:02:41.420
CALLED SYSTEM IS VERY NEW --

02:02:41.487 --> 02:02:42.722
RELATIVE TO THE FOR YOUR SYSTEM

02:02:42.788 --> 02:02:44.090
AND AND IT SHOWS UP IN THE

02:02:44.156 --> 02:02:45.091
NUMBERS ACROSS THE BOARD TO THE

02:02:45.157 --> 02:02:46.559
DATA POINT I MOST OFTEN REPEAT

02:02:46.625 --> 02:02:47.393
AS OF LATE IS THAT IF YOU LOOK

02:02:47.460 --> 02:02:48.928
AT WHAT AMERICANS GIVE TO

02:02:48.994 --> 02:02:51.097
CHARITY -- WE CROSS FOUR HUNDRED

02:02:51.163 --> 02:02:52.832
BILLION DOLLARS ACCORDING TO

02:02:52.898 --> 02:02:53.966
GIVE US A TO A YEAR AND A HALF

02:02:54.033 --> 02:02:56.535
AGO OF THAT THE SECOND LARGEST

02:02:56.602 --> 02:02:58.404
PIECE GOES TO EDUCATION.

02:02:58.471 --> 02:02:59.905
THAT'S JUST 14%.

02:02:59.972 --> 02:03:02.274
BUT ONLY POINT 2% ACTUALLY COMES

02:03:02.341 --> 02:03:03.776
TO COMMUNITY COLLEGES AND YET WE

02:03:03.843 --> 02:03:06.445
ARE HALF OF THE NATION'S COLLEGE

02:03:06.512 --> 02:03:07.413
SERVING YOU KNOW SERVING HAVE

02:03:07.480 --> 02:03:08.681
THIS NATION'S COLLEGE STUDENTS.

02:03:08.748 --> 02:03:10.583
SO I THINK IF IF WE WANT TO

02:03:10.649 --> 02:03:11.751
INVEST IN THIS THE FLIGHT WE

02:03:11.817 --> 02:03:13.619
SHOULD NEVER TAKE THE PLACE OF

02:03:13.686 --> 02:03:15.721
OUR PUBLIC COMMITMENT -- BUT WE

02:03:15.788 --> 02:03:17.123
CERTAINLY CAN BUILD AND LEVERAGE

02:03:17.189 --> 02:03:18.824
THE PHILANTHROPIC PARTNERSHIPS

02:03:18.891 --> 02:03:20.693
AROUND THIS SO IF WE GET CLEAR

02:03:20.760 --> 02:03:22.094
IN MESSAGE WHAT THAT WE ARE

02:03:22.161 --> 02:03:24.063
DOING AS A FROM THE PUBLIC SIDE

02:03:24.130 --> 02:03:25.898
THAT THAT IS INCREDIBLY VALUABLE

02:03:25.965 --> 02:03:26.999
TO THE BROADER COMMUNITY THAT

02:03:27.066 --> 02:03:27.533
WANTS TO SUPPORT HIGHER

02:03:27.600 --> 02:03:28.534
EDUCATION.

02:03:28.601 --> 02:03:29.668
AND COMMUNITY COLLEGES REALLY

02:03:29.735 --> 02:03:31.737
SHOULD MOVE TO THE CENTER OF

02:03:31.804 --> 02:03:32.371
THAT AND THAT'S THAT'S WHAT WE

02:03:32.438 --> 02:03:33.439
TRY TO DO.

02:03:33.506 --> 02:03:37.576
MISS RECORD IF I COULD WEIGH IN

02:03:37.643 --> 02:03:39.779
ON HIS.

02:03:39.845 --> 02:03:41.147
CREDIBLE POINT THERE.

02:03:41.213 --> 02:03:41.847
IT ALSO DEALS WITH --

02:03:41.914 --> 02:03:43.616
FINANCIALLY DISCUSSION THAT

02:03:43.682 --> 02:03:45.284
YOU'RE LEADING.

02:03:45.351 --> 02:03:46.786
THAT IS AND THE HERE'S THE POOL

02:03:46.852 --> 02:03:47.953
OF HEALTH FUNDS AVAILABLE TO ALL

02:03:48.020 --> 02:03:49.722
AMERICANS. FIFTY OR SO PERCENT

02:03:49.789 --> 02:03:51.857
OF ALL HIGHER EDUCATION.

02:03:51.924 --> 02:03:53.392
STUDENTS ARE OUT THE COMMITTEE

02:03:53.459 --> 02:03:57.029
CALL JUST YET OF THE PILL FUNDS.

02:03:57.096 --> 02:03:59.632
10% IS DISTRIBUTED TO THE KID TO

02:03:59.698 --> 02:04:01.133
THE NATION'S COMMUNITY COLLEGES

02:04:01.200 --> 02:04:02.168
INCLUDING CALIFORNIA WHICH IS

02:04:02.234 --> 02:04:04.537
THE LARGEST SEGMENT SO WE'RE NOT

02:04:04.603 --> 02:04:05.304
GETTING OUR FAIR SHARE THE BILL

02:04:05.371 --> 02:04:05.971
FUNDS.

02:04:06.038 --> 02:04:06.939
OF THOSE WHO WOULD OTHERWISE BE

02:04:07.006 --> 02:04:08.841
ELIGIBLE SO THAT IS OUR POLICY

02:04:08.908 --> 02:04:11.877
DISCUSSIONS THAT ALL LEVERAGE

02:04:11.944 --> 02:04:12.511
TOGETHER BRAIDED TOGETHER COULD

02:04:12.578 --> 02:04:13.312
REALLY.

02:04:13.379 --> 02:04:15.514
MAKE -- TOWARDS ADDRESSING IN

02:04:15.581 --> 02:04:17.349
ADDRESSING THOSE GAPS IN THE

02:04:17.416 --> 02:04:19.018
TOTAL COST OF TUITION.

02:04:19.084 --> 02:04:22.354
THE COURT COLD ACOSTA CITY HAVE

02:04:22.421 --> 02:04:24.023
A TENDENCY TO MAKE COLLEGE.

02:04:24.089 --> 02:04:25.457
YEAH SO I I I I LOVE TO SING

02:04:25.524 --> 02:04:25.991
THESE COMMUNITIES ACROSS

02:04:26.058 --> 02:04:27.459
CALIFORNIA DOING IT ON THEIR OWN

02:04:27.526 --> 02:04:29.395
TO HEAR AND WES ACT THEY PASSED

02:04:29.461 --> 02:04:32.131
A BUT SALES TAX MEASURE IN THERE

02:04:32.198 --> 02:04:34.433
BEING SOME TO THEIR PROMISE

02:04:34.500 --> 02:04:38.437
PROGRAM -- IN SAN FRANCISCO AND

02:04:38.504 --> 02:04:41.106
LA YOU'RE DOING IN SANTA BARBARA.

02:04:41.173 --> 02:04:42.408
AND SO OF COURSE YOU CAN USE

02:04:42.474 --> 02:04:44.643
THAT MONEY TO TO MAKE YOUR

02:04:44.710 --> 02:04:46.245
PROGRAMS MORE ROBUST AND AND

02:04:46.312 --> 02:04:47.279
COVER THAT BOOKS IN.

02:04:47.346 --> 02:04:49.114
TUITION AND I MEAN I'M SORRY BUT

02:04:49.181 --> 02:04:52.184
NOT TUITION TO BOOKS.

02:04:52.251 --> 02:04:53.919
TRANSPORTATION AND SO FORTH.

02:04:53.986 --> 02:04:55.621
WHAT DO WE THINK AS FAR AS THE

02:04:55.688 --> 02:04:56.355
HUNDRED OR SO?

02:04:56.422 --> 02:04:58.190
COMMITTEE CALL DISTRICTS ACROSS

CALIFORNIA HOW MANY OF THEM.

02:05:00.759 --> 02:05:02.294
ARE USING OTHER MONEY TO

02:05:02.361 --> 02:05:05.497
STRENGTHEN THEIR PROMISE

02:05:05.564 --> 02:05:05.798
[inaudible]

CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE FIRE

02:06:56.508 --> 02:06:57.643
OF FIRE LIFE SAFETY ISSUES --

02:06:57.710 --> 02:06:59.011
AREN'T NECESSARILY THE SOLE

02:06:59.078 --> 02:07:01.013
REASON FOR COMMUNITY COLLEGE

PROJECT TO BE CONSIDERED FOR

02:07:01.880 --> 02:07:04.616
FUNDING IT SHOULD BE A

02:07:04.683 --> 02:07:05.617
SIGNIFICANT DRIVER.

02:07:05.684 --> 02:07:06.952
DETERMINING WHICH PROJECTS TO BE

FUNDED THE ADMINISTRATION

02:07:07.886 --> 02:07:09.621
CONSIDERS WHETHER A REQUESTING

02:07:09.688 --> 02:07:11.390
DISTRICT CAN PROVIDE SOME LEVEL

02:07:11.457 --> 02:07:12.624
OF FUNDING MATCH WITH OUR

02:07:12.691 --> 02:07:14.860
EXTENUATING CIRCUMSTANCES THAT

02:07:14.927 --> 02:07:15.394
PREVENT THE DISTRICT FROM

02:07:15.461 --> 02:07:16.495
CONTRIBUTING.

02:07:16.562 --> 02:07:17.930
EXAMPLE OF THE LATTER WOULD

02:07:17.997 --> 02:07:19.131
INCLUDE REDWOOD COMMUNITY

02:07:19.198 --> 02:07:21.033
COLLEGE A SMALL DISTRICT WITH

RESULTING FROM RECENT SEISMIC

02:07:23.902 --> 02:07:25.037
ANALYSES.

02:07:25.104 --> 02:07:27.006
OTHER EXAMPLES WOULD BE A RECENT

02:07:27.072 --> 02:07:28.741
UNSUCCESSFUL ATTEMPT AT PASSING

02:07:28.807 --> 02:07:30.709
A LOCAL BOND OR DEMONSTRATING

02:07:30.776 --> 02:07:33.345
THAT DISTRICT HAS REACHED ITS

02:07:33.412 --> 02:07:35.347
THE BOND CAPACITY -- CONCERNS

02:07:35.414 --> 02:07:36.081
HAVE BEEN RAISED THAT THE

02:07:36.148 --> 02:07:37.316
ADMINISTRATION'S APPROACH

02:07:37.383 --> 02:07:38.784
CREATES A DISINCENTIVE FOR

02:07:38.851 --> 02:07:39.985
DISTRICTS TO MAINTAIN THE

02:07:40.052 --> 02:07:42.488
FACILITY -- HOWEVER THE

02:07:42.554 --> 02:07:44.690
COMMUNITY COLLEGE NO TO NEED FOR

02:07:44.757 --> 02:07:45.657
SIXTEEN POINT SIX BILLION IN

02:07:45.724 --> 02:07:47.426
STATE FUNDS OVER THE NEXT FIVE

02:07:47.493 --> 02:07:49.094
YEARS WELL IN THAT ACCESS OF THE

BOND FUNDS.

02:07:53.799 --> 02:07:55.701
THEREFORE WE FIND UNLIKELY THAT

02:07:55.768 --> 02:07:56.869
COLLEGES OF PURPLE SO THEY ALLOW

02:07:56.935 --> 02:07:58.170
THEIR BUILDINGS TO FALL INTO

02:07:58.237 --> 02:07:59.238
DISREPAIR.

02:07:59.304 --> 02:08:01.040
RISKING THE SAFETY OF ITS

I RIVER BRAWL AT THE LEGISLATIVE

02:08:07.713 --> 02:08:09.548
OF PREDICT TWO RECOMMENDATIONS

02:08:09.615 --> 02:08:11.050
WITH THIS ISSUE THE FIRST THING

02:08:11.116 --> 02:08:11.884
WE RECOMMEND IS THAT THE

02:08:11.950 --> 02:08:14.119
LEGISLATURE CONSIDER APPROVING

02:08:14.186 --> 02:08:16.755
MORE -- PROVING MORE PROP FIFTY

ONE BOND FUNDING FOR COMMUNITY

02:08:17.589 --> 02:08:19.024
COLLEGES THAN WHAT WAS IN THE

02:08:19.091 --> 02:08:20.426
GOVERNOR'S BUDGET -- WE NOTED

02:08:20.492 --> 02:08:23.495
THAT -- THIS ADMINISTRATION DOES

02:08:23.562 --> 02:08:24.129
THE NEWS THE MINISTRATION DOES

02:08:24.196 --> 02:08:24.763
INCLUDE.

02:08:24.830 --> 02:08:26.331
MANY MORE PROJECTS IN IN THEIR

02:08:26.398 --> 02:08:27.900
BUDGET THEM WERE WERE INCLUDED

02:08:27.966 --> 02:08:29.468
IN PREVIOUS BUDGET UNDER THE

02:08:29.535 --> 02:08:30.836
BRAND ADMINISTRATION.

02:08:30.903 --> 02:08:31.637
THE STATE IS STILL ON PRETTY

02:08:31.703 --> 02:08:33.972
SLOW PACE FOR EXHAUSTING ALL THE

02:08:34.039 --> 02:08:36.108
PROFITS. FIFTY ONE BOND FUNDS

02:08:36.175 --> 02:08:37.376
THE AT THIS POINT IT'S AT THE

02:08:37.443 --> 02:08:39.311
BOTTOM NINE YEAR PIECE -- TO TO

02:08:39.378 --> 02:08:41.046
TO EXHAUST ALL THOSE FUNDS.

02:08:41.113 --> 02:08:42.381
I'M USED TO THAT WAS THE THE

02:08:42.448 --> 02:08:43.816
FIRST THE RECOMMENDATIONS.

02:08:43.882 --> 02:08:45.951
THE THE SECOND OR THIRD

02:08:46.018 --> 02:08:48.520
RECOMMENDATIONS IS GREAT -- TOO

02:08:48.587 --> 02:08:50.889
ADDRESSES CAN ACT ISSUE OF HOW

02:08:50.956 --> 02:08:51.990
LIFE SAFETY PROJECT AND HOW

02:08:52.057 --> 02:08:53.725
LIGHT THE FUSE USED IN

02:08:53.792 --> 02:08:56.495
EVALUATING -- WHETHER PROJECTS

02:08:56.562 --> 02:08:57.996
TO BE INCLUDED IN THE BUDGET.

02:08:58.063 --> 02:09:00.165
I'M THE THE CHANCES OF IT HAS A

02:09:00.232 --> 02:09:03.535
LONG STANDING PROCESS -- FOR

02:09:03.602 --> 02:09:05.337
THAT WITH A SORE SEPARATE --

02:09:05.404 --> 02:09:06.071
WITH A REVIEW LIVE FIFTY

02:09:06.138 --> 02:09:07.005
PROJECTS AND THEN ALL THE OTHER

02:09:07.072 --> 02:09:08.874
PROJECTS ARE ARE EVALUATED BASED

02:09:08.941 --> 02:09:10.142
ON OTHER NEEDS SUCH AS WHETHER

02:09:10.209 --> 02:09:11.944
THERE'S A NEED FOR MODERNIZATION

02:09:12.010 --> 02:09:14.079
OR FOR ADDITIONAL INSTRUCTION

02:09:14.146 --> 02:09:14.980
CAPACITY.

02:09:15.047 --> 02:09:17.249
I'M THE THE ADMINISTRATION HAS

02:09:17.316 --> 02:09:19.651
BEEN ALSO LOOKING AT THROUGH A

02:09:19.718 --> 02:09:20.719
DIFFERENT LIFE SAFETY LENDS IT

02:09:20.786 --> 02:09:22.221
LOOKING UP ALL PROJECTS THAT WAY

02:09:22.287 --> 02:09:23.522
WE JUST CREATED A LOT OF

02:09:23.589 --> 02:09:25.424
CONFUSION FOR DISTRICTS -- IN

02:09:25.491 --> 02:09:27.493
TERMS OF TRYING TO UNDERSTAND

02:09:27.559 --> 02:09:28.026
WHY THE PROJECT ARE BEING

02:09:28.093 --> 02:09:29.695
APPROVED IN WHICH PROJECTS ARE

02:09:29.761 --> 02:09:30.429
GOOD CANDIDATES FOR BEING

02:09:30.496 --> 02:09:32.264
SUBMITTED.

02:09:32.331 --> 02:09:46.311
AND WE THINK ALSO -- BY LOOKING

02:09:46.378 --> 02:09:47.579
AT EVERYTHING TO REALIZE THE

02:09:47.646 --> 02:09:49.081
VILLAINS ACTUALLY -- MEANS THAT

02:09:49.148 --> 02:09:49.748
THE THE ADMINISTRATION'S

02:09:49.815 --> 02:09:51.416
APPROACH WOULD BE PRIORITIZING

02:09:51.483 --> 02:09:51.917
PROJECTS.

02:09:51.984 --> 02:09:52.518
IN DISTRICTS THAT POTENTIALLY

02:09:52.584 --> 02:09:53.619
WOULD HAVE DONE A POOR JOB OF

02:09:53.685 --> 02:09:55.020
MAINTAINING THE BUILDINGS.

02:09:55.087 --> 02:09:55.621
SO FOR THOSE REASONS WE WOULD

02:09:55.687 --> 02:09:56.421
RECOMMEND THAT THAT THE

02:09:56.488 --> 02:09:57.656
LEGISLATURE ARE REQUIRE THE

02:09:57.723 --> 02:09:58.423

THE ROLLOUT YEAH THEY'RE

02:17:04.749 --> 02:17:06.151
ACTUALLY THREE DIFFERENT

02:17:06.217 --> 02:17:07.285
TRAINING PROGRAMS THAT WE'RE

02:17:07.352 --> 02:17:11.022

02:17:11.089 --> 02:17:13.758
I MENTIONED MEDICAL CODING ONE

02:17:13.825 --> 02:17:16.928
IS -- SO IT IS SECOND IS THE

02:17:16.995 --> 02:17:18.897
FUNDAMENTALS OF IT AND THIRD IS

02:17:18.964 --> 02:17:22.067
CYBERSECURITY -- WHAT'S

02:17:22.133 --> 02:17:23.668
INTERESTING IS THAT MEDICAL

02:17:23.735 --> 02:17:25.437
CODING ACTUALLY WAS IDENTIFIED

02:17:25.503 --> 02:17:27.939
BY THE MEMBERS OF S. CI YOU.

02:17:28.006 --> 02:17:32.043
AS A A GREAT PAYING JOB AND A

02:17:32.110 --> 02:17:33.478
WONDERFUL OPPORTUNITY FOR ITS

02:17:33.545 --> 02:17:35.814
MEMBERS TO GET ADDITIONAL SKILLS.

02:17:35.880 --> 02:17:37.248
AND TO GET PLACED INTO THOSE

02:17:37.315 --> 02:17:41.686
JOBS AND I THINK IT'S A VERY

02:17:41.753 --> 02:17:44.656
INTERESTING OPPORTUNITY -- FOR

02:17:44.723 --> 02:17:47.626
WORKING WITH WORKING ADULTS AND

02:17:47.692 --> 02:17:49.427
AND IMPARTING IN IMPRESSING UPON

02:17:49.494 --> 02:17:51.997
THEM THE FACT THAT -- THIS

02:17:52.063 --> 02:17:54.699
TRAINING PROGRAM GETS THEM.

02:17:54.766 --> 02:17:56.868
INTO THE SECTOR OF HEALTH CARE

02:17:56.935 --> 02:17:59.237
AND PREPARED VERY WELL PREPARED

02:17:59.304 --> 02:18:01.840
FOR WORKING IN THAT -- SECTOR IN

02:18:01.906 --> 02:18:03.975
THE FUTURE BUT THOSE ARE

02:18:04.042 --> 02:18:05.076
ACTUALLY JOBS THAT ARE BEING

02:18:05.143 --> 02:18:06.778
MADE OBSOLETE THROUGH OBSOLETE

02:18:06.845 --> 02:18:07.812
THROUGH DIFFERENT KINDS OF

02:18:07.879 --> 02:18:08.980
TECHNOLOGY.

02:18:09.047 --> 02:18:10.749
AND SO I THINK IT'S A REALLY

02:18:10.815 --> 02:18:12.484
GOOD OPPORTUNITY TO ILLUSTRATE

02:18:12.550 --> 02:18:13.351
TO PEOPLE THAT IT'S NOT THE

02:18:13.418 --> 02:18:15.086
FINAL DESTINATION IN A JOB BUT

02:18:15.153 --> 02:18:16.755
IT IS THE STARTING.

02:18:16.821 --> 02:18:19.124
POINT -- FOR MANY DIFFERENT

02:18:19.190 --> 02:18:20.792
TYPES OF JOBS THAT COULD BE IN

02:18:20.859 --> 02:18:30.101
THAT SECTOR -- AND AND THE THIS

02:18:30.168 --> 02:18:31.970
VOTE I'M SORRY I DIDN'T MEAN TO

02:18:32.037 --> 02:18:33.605
INTERRUPT YOU AND AND SO WE

02:18:33.672 --> 02:18:34.506
THINK THAT.

02:18:34.572 --> 02:18:37.642
IT'S INTERESTING -- TO TO REALLY

02:18:37.709 --> 02:18:40.445
IMPRESS UPON PEOPLE THAT WE ARE

02:18:40.512 --> 02:18:42.414
WORKING AN ECONOMY THAT IS --

02:18:42.480 --> 02:18:45.150
CHANGING EVER MORE RAPIDLY AND

02:18:45.216 --> 02:18:47.118
THE PEOPLE WILL NEED TO PROVIDE

02:18:47.185 --> 02:18:49.054
AND ACQUIRE NEW SKILLS TO STAY

02:18:49.120 --> 02:18:50.622
RELEVANT.

02:18:50.689 --> 02:18:53.458
AND TO THRIVE AND SO THIS IS A

02:18:53.525 --> 02:18:54.959
REALLY GOOD ILLUSTRATION -- I

02:18:55.026 --> 02:18:57.429
THINK OF THAT PARTICULAR POINT.

02:18:57.495 --> 02:18:59.364
UNLIKE CYBERSECURITY WHICH IS

02:18:59.431 --> 02:19:00.932
THE SECOND TRACK THAT WE

02:19:00.999 --> 02:19:03.835
SELECTED WHERE THERE IS -- AN

02:19:03.902 --> 02:19:06.204
EXPLOSION OF NEW TYPES OF JOBS

02:19:06.271 --> 02:19:08.173
IN NEW RESPONSIBILITIES EVER IT

02:19:08.239 --> 02:19:10.709
YOU KNOW INCREASING -- IN THE

02:19:10.775 --> 02:19:14.012
CYBER SECURITY AREA.

02:19:14.079 --> 02:19:15.280
BUT YET -- YOU CAN BE AN

02:19:15.346 --> 02:19:17.949
ADMINISTRATOR LEARN THE FIRST

02:19:18.016 --> 02:19:20.418
KIND OF LEVEL OF CYBER SECURITY

02:19:20.485 --> 02:19:21.886
PROTOCOL AND INCREASE YOUR

02:19:21.953 --> 02:19:24.189
SALARY BY SAY TWENTY THOUSAND

02:19:24.255 --> 02:19:24.956
DOLLARS A YEAR.

02:19:25.023 --> 02:19:27.625
SO -- SO THOSE ARE TWO DIFFERENT

02:19:27.692 --> 02:19:30.295
TYPES OF TRAINING MODELS -- OR

02:19:30.361 --> 02:19:31.196
TWO DIFFERENT KINDS OF I THINK

02:19:31.262 --> 02:19:33.298
EXPERIENCES THAT OUR FOLKS WE'LL

02:19:33.364 --> 02:19:36.000
GET TO THOSE PROGRAMS -- YOU'LL

02:19:36.067 --> 02:19:37.268
RECALL THAT WE ARE.

02:19:37.335 --> 02:19:38.303
BUILDING SKILLS UPGRADING

A ROLE TO MAKE SURE THAT'S THE

02:21:44.729 --> 02:21:45.897

02:32:42.753 --> 02:32:48.559
THAT DEAL WITH LET'S JUST LEAVE

02:32:48.626 --> 02:32:48.993

02:32:49.059 --> 02:32:52.429
THANK YOU.

02:32:52.496 --> 02:32:54.498
THE LETTER LIMóN ON THIS TOPIC

02:32:54.565 --> 02:32:54.865
I AM.

02:32:54.932 --> 02:32:55.599
WHAT I HEARD AND AND I REMEMBER

02:32:55.666 --> 02:32:56.901
BEING IN THE HEARINGS LAST YEAR

02:32:56.967 --> 02:32:59.336
AND THE LEGISLATIVE INTENT WAS

02:32:59.403 --> 02:33:02.106
THAT THIS WOULD NOT [inaudible]

02:33:02.172 --> 02:33:03.440
REPLICATE.

02:33:03.507 --> 02:33:05.075
ANY COURSES OFFERED.

02:33:05.142 --> 02:33:07.344
THE NEW ONES THAT I JUST HEARD

02:33:07.411 --> 02:33:09.079
YOU SAY IS THAT.

02:33:09.146 --> 02:33:11.348
IT'S A DIFFERENT EXPERIENCE HOW

02:33:11.415 --> 02:33:13.584
IS THE CHANCELLOR'S OFF LIKE YOU

02:33:13.651 --> 02:33:14.385
DON'T NECESSARY SAY IT WASN'T

02:33:14.451 --> 02:33:15.052
THE RIGHT SAME COURSE YOU SAID

02:33:15.119 --> 02:33:16.320
IT'S A DIFFERENT EXPERIENCE SO I

02:33:16.387 --> 02:33:18.055
WANT TO KNOW WHAT DEFINITION THE

02:33:18.122 --> 02:33:19.557
CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE.

02:33:19.623 --> 02:33:25.029
IS USING TO DEFINE WHETHER OR

02:33:25.095 --> 02:33:26.664
NOT IT'S THE SAME COURSE BECAUSE

02:33:26.730 --> 02:33:27.965
A MEAN CERTAINLY THERE WAS

02:33:28.032 --> 02:33:29.033
APPROVAL FOR IT BUT THERE WAS.

02:33:29.099 --> 02:33:31.435
ALSO VERY CLEAR INTENT OF WHERE

02:33:31.502 --> 02:33:33.437
WE WANTED TO GO AND I THINK THIS

02:33:33.504 --> 02:33:37.341
NEW WANTS CAN ACTUALLY -- MAKE

02:33:37.408 --> 02:33:39.476
US RETHINK ABOUT WHETHER THE

02:33:39.543 --> 02:33:40.778
INTENT IS BEING MET OR NOT.

02:33:40.844 --> 02:33:42.813
IT CAN BE DEFINED.

02:33:42.880 --> 02:33:44.181
IN ANY LEGAL WHERE WHICH WAY BUT

02:33:44.248 --> 02:33:46.050
AGAIN A THINK FOR THOSE OF US

02:33:46.116 --> 02:33:47.351
THAT WERE IN THOSE CONVERSATIONS

02:33:47.418 --> 02:33:48.652
LAST YEAR THAT.

02:33:48.719 --> 02:33:51.355
WE WERE VERY CLEAR.

02:33:51.422 --> 02:33:52.723
YEAH BUT IT'S I WOULD SAY FROM --

02:33:52.790 --> 02:33:54.158
YOU KNOW THE STATUTE DOESN'T

02:33:54.224 --> 02:33:55.459
INCLUDE A STANDARD SO I THINK

02:33:55.526 --> 02:33:56.594
THE COMMITMENT WE NEED TO MAKE

02:33:56.660 --> 02:33:57.494
THIS TO YOU ALL INTO OUR

02:33:57.561 --> 02:33:59.930
COLLEGES THAT WE'RE NOT BUILDING

02:33:59.997 --> 02:34:03.000
A COLLEGE THAT -- THAT IS GOING

02:34:03.067 --> 02:34:04.335
TO COMPETE FOR STUDENTS.

02:34:04.401 --> 02:34:06.303
ABOUT THEIR ALSO SERVING AND SO

02:34:06.370 --> 02:34:07.871
I WOULD SAY THE VERY CLEAR LINE

02:34:07.938 --> 02:34:09.239
AS I'VE UNDERSTOOD IT BUT I

02:34:09.306 --> 02:34:11.342
THINK -- YOU KNOW IF THERE'S A

02:34:11.408 --> 02:34:12.409
DIFFERENCE WE WILL COME BACK AND

02:34:12.476 --> 02:34:14.778
TELL YOU IS THE COMPETENCY BASED

02:34:14.845 --> 02:34:16.981
EDUCATION -- THAT IT IS EITHER

02:34:17.047 --> 02:34:19.617
DIFFERENT FIELDS ALL TOGETHER OR

02:34:19.683 --> 02:34:20.851
THE DELIVERY IN COP AS A

02:34:20.918 --> 02:34:22.820
COMPETENCY BASED -- FORM OF

02:34:22.886 --> 02:34:26.624
LEARNING -- IS DIFFERENT THAN

02:34:26.690 --> 02:34:27.124
WHAT IS OFFERED AT OTHER

02:34:27.191 --> 02:34:27.558
COLLEGES [inaudible]

02:34:27.625 --> 02:34:29.293
SO.

02:34:29.360 --> 02:34:30.527
YOU'RE BASICALLY SAYING IF YOU

02:34:30.594 --> 02:34:31.996
CAN FIND A WORK AROUND TO

02:34:32.062 --> 02:34:33.464
OFFERING THE SAME COURSE BECAUSE

02:34:33.530 --> 02:34:34.398
IT'S SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT

02:34:34.465 --> 02:34:35.699
EXPERIENCE AND THAT'S WHAT THE

02:34:35.766 --> 02:34:37.101
IT MEETS THE CRITERIA BUT I WANT

02:34:37.167 --> 02:34:38.535
TO JUST BE VERY SPECIFIC BUT AS

02:34:38.602 --> 02:34:39.837
I UNDERSTAND.

02:34:39.903 --> 02:34:41.171
THE CONVERSATIONS IT IS SPEND

02:34:41.238 --> 02:34:42.673
THAT IS IT IS DIFFERENT BECAUSE

02:34:42.740 --> 02:34:44.675
IT IS OFFERED AS COMPETENCY

02:34:44.742 --> 02:34:46.577
BASED EDUCATION AND THAT'S WHY

02:34:46.644 --> 02:34:47.978
BY THE LEADERSHIP AND AS A

02:34:48.045 --> 02:34:48.545
CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE WE WERE

02:34:48.612 --> 02:34:50.180
COMFORTABLE WITH THE PROGRAMS

02:34:50.247 --> 02:34:51.715
THAT ARE BEING OFFERED BY THE BY

02:34:51.782 --> 02:34:52.983
THEIR LIKE COLLEGE.

02:34:53.050 --> 02:34:54.818
IF I MAY UM THE FIRST PROGRAM

02:34:54.885 --> 02:34:56.120
AND AND THAT'S WHY I ACTUALLY

02:34:56.186 --> 02:34:57.888
WENT INTO THE DETAIL OF MEDICAL

02:34:57.955 --> 02:34:59.556
CODING IS CHANGING AS A WHOLE

02:34:59.623 --> 02:35:01.058
CAREER AN OPTION.

02:35:01.125 --> 02:35:03.494
THAT ACTUALLY WAS SELECTED PRIOR

02:35:03.560 --> 02:35:05.729
TO MY BEING -- HIRED IT WAS

02:35:05.796 --> 02:35:07.998
SELECTED BECAUSE IT WAS -- MOST

02:35:08.065 --> 02:35:10.367
POPULAR WITH SCA USE MEMBERSHIP

02:35:10.434 --> 02:35:11.702
THEY CONSIDER THOSE WELL PAYING

02:35:11.769 --> 02:35:14.204
JOBS THAT THEY WANTED TO GET THE

02:35:14.271 --> 02:35:15.739
SKILLS AND TRAINING IN AND WE

02:35:15.806 --> 02:35:17.508
WANTED A FREE OFFERING THAT

02:35:17.574 --> 02:35:19.076
WOULD ACTUALLY COUNTER.

02:35:19.143 --> 02:35:20.678
THE FOR PROFITS WERE CHARGING

02:35:20.744 --> 02:35:22.513
PEOPLE TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS JUST

02:35:22.579 --> 02:35:24.014
TO LEARN TO BE MEDICAL CODERS

02:35:24.081 --> 02:35:25.449
AND THEY'LL NEVER GET OUT FROM

02:35:25.516 --> 02:35:27.317
UNDER THAT DEBT -- SO THAT WAS

02:35:27.384 --> 02:35:28.552
MY UNDERSTANDING OF ABOUT THE

02:35:28.619 --> 02:35:32.489
ORIGIN I WILL SPEAK FROM -- MY

02:35:32.556 --> 02:35:33.524
THIRTY YEARS OF EXPERIENCE BOTH

02:35:33.590 --> 02:35:34.958
IN EDUCATION AND WORKFORCE

02:35:35.025 --> 02:35:36.760
DEVELOPMENT THAT HAVING

02:35:36.827 --> 02:35:38.362
CONFIDENCE IN SEAT COMPETENCY

02:35:38.429 --> 02:35:40.931
BASED TRAINING THAT IS SPECIFIC

02:35:40.998 --> 02:35:41.532
TO THE HARD FUNCTIONAL SOFT

02:35:41.598 --> 02:35:42.566
SKILLS.

02:35:42.633 --> 02:35:44.568
REQUIRED TO DO THAT JOB IS VERY

02:35:44.635 --> 02:35:46.170
DIFFERENT FROM THE MEDICAL

02:35:46.236 --> 02:35:49.173
CODING CURRICULA -- IT CURRICULA

02:35:49.239 --> 02:35:51.308
EXPERIENCE THAT ONE ONE GET A

02:35:51.375 --> 02:35:52.176
COMMUNITY COLLEGE.

02:35:52.242 --> 02:35:53.077
I DON'T THINK THAT THAT'S WHAT

02:35:53.143 --> 02:35:54.645
THAT QUESTION I MEAN THAT WAS AN

02:35:54.712 --> 02:35:56.814
EXAMPLE THAT WAS THAT WAS

02:35:56.880 --> 02:35:59.016
DISCUSSED LAST YEAR -- THAT VERY

02:35:59.083 --> 02:36:01.151
CLEARLY BUT I THINK AS WE MOVE

02:36:01.218 --> 02:36:02.553
FORWARD THERE LOOK THERE'S NO

02:36:02.619 --> 02:36:04.822
SURPRISE THAT THE LEGISLATURE.

02:36:04.888 --> 02:36:06.123
DIDN'T NECESSARILY LOVE THIS

02:36:06.190 --> 02:36:08.559
PROPOSAL AND I MEAN THAT THIS IS

02:36:08.625 --> 02:36:10.461
NOT A SECRET AND SO I THINK THAT

02:36:10.527 --> 02:36:13.030
AS THE PROPOSAL MOVES FORWARD

02:36:13.097 --> 02:36:14.231
THIS IS AN AND I GOTCHA GAME NO

02:36:14.298 --> 02:36:15.265
ONE TRIED WE'RE TRYING TO

02:36:15.332 --> 02:36:16.700
UNDERSTAND WHAT REALLY HAPPENED

02:36:16.767 --> 02:36:17.634
THAT IS PART.

02:36:17.701 --> 02:36:19.136
OF THE ROLE THAT THE LEGISLATURE

02:36:19.203 --> 02:36:22.973
PLEASE -- AND SO I DON'T THINK

02:36:23.040 --> 02:36:23.941
THIS IS ABOUT ANYONE.

02:36:24.007 --> 02:36:25.809
YOU KNOW WANTING TO DO SOMETHING

02:36:25.876 --> 02:36:31.448
WRONG OR GOING EAST AS WE NEED

02:36:31.515 --> 02:36:32.082
TO UNDERSTAND AND I THINK THESE

02:36:32.149 --> 02:36:32.616
POINTED QUESTIONS HELP US

02:36:32.683 --> 02:36:33.217
UNDERSTAND -- WE WERE ALREADY

02:36:33.283 --> 02:36:34.251
SKEPTICAL ABOUT THIS AS A

02:36:34.318 --> 02:36:35.886
LEGISLATURE ON WHETHER THIS WAS

02:36:35.953 --> 02:36:37.988
THE RIGHT MOVE OR NOT -- AND I

02:36:38.055 --> 02:36:39.389
SUSPECT THAT WE ARE GOING TO

02:36:39.456 --> 02:36:41.358
CONTINUE TO ASK THIS LEVEL OF

02:36:41.425 --> 02:36:43.393
QUESTION -- AS A WAY TO

02:36:43.460 --> 02:36:45.863
UNDERSTAND WHETHER OUR SKEPTIC

02:36:45.929 --> 02:36:47.698
IT'S A SKEPTICISM WAS EIGHT YOU

02:36:47.765 --> 02:36:49.566
KNOW IT MERITED OR NOT AND IF

02:36:49.633 --> 02:36:51.835
IT'S NOT IT'S GREAT LIKE IF IT'S

02:36:51.902 --> 02:36:52.603
IF IF WE FIND.

02:36:52.669 --> 02:36:54.071
THAT THIS IS ACTUALLY A BETTER

02:36:54.138 --> 02:36:55.739
PATH TO MOVE FORWARD IN AND WE

02:36:55.806 --> 02:36:57.775
ARE REALLY LIKING IT I THINK

02:36:57.841 --> 02:36:59.543
THAT'S GREAT WE'RE NOT THERE YET --

02:36:59.610 --> 02:37:00.878
I WOULD SAY I DON'T KNOW I'M

02:37:00.944 --> 02:37:02.446
LOOKING AT THE CHAIR BUT I COULD

02:37:02.513 --> 02:37:04.414
BE A LOAN IN THIS MAYBE IT'S

02:37:04.481 --> 02:37:07.417
JUST ME -- BUT I THINK IT'S

02:37:07.484 --> 02:37:08.585
IMPORTANT TO ASK THESE QUESTIONS

02:37:08.652 --> 02:37:10.087
THEY SENSE SLIGHT DEFENSIVENESS

02:37:10.154 --> 02:37:12.322
AND I THINK IT'S MORE A SENSE OF

02:37:12.389 --> 02:37:14.291
REALLY TRYING TO ASK I KNOW

02:37:14.358 --> 02:37:16.059
THERE HARD QUESTIONS I KNOW WE

02:37:16.126 --> 02:37:17.361
DON'T KNOW ALL THE ANSWERS.

02:37:17.427 --> 02:37:19.630
BUT I HAVE A THINK IT'S

02:37:19.696 --> 02:37:21.431
IMPORTANT TO JUST ASK THEM --

02:37:21.498 --> 02:37:23.133
AND INTO UNDERSTAND WHERE WE'RE

02:37:23.200 --> 02:37:25.269
AT SO THAT WE CAN ALSO WE ALL GO

02:37:25.335 --> 02:37:28.572
BACK TO OUR COMMUNITY COLLEGES I

02:37:28.639 --> 02:37:29.940
TO TALK ABOUT THESE THINGS.

02:37:30.007 --> 02:37:33.177
AND SO I THINK THE MORE

02:37:33.243 --> 02:37:35.179
INFORMATION WE HAVE THE BETTER.

02:37:35.245 --> 02:37:36.013
AND I HOPE I WOULD JUST WANT TO

02:37:36.079 --> 02:37:37.114
CLARIFY THAT I I HOPE YOU DON'T

02:37:37.181 --> 02:37:38.182
CENTS DEFENSIVENESS FROM THE

02:37:38.248 --> 02:37:39.183
CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE I WOULD JUST

02:37:39.249 --> 02:37:41.351
SAY -- YOU KNOW I THINK LIKE WE

02:37:41.418 --> 02:37:43.320
DO WITH OTHER COLLEGES WE YOU

02:37:43.387 --> 02:37:45.088
KNOW THE THE WORK OF THE ONLINE

02:37:45.155 --> 02:37:46.390
COLLEGES BEING HANDLED BY THE

02:37:46.456 --> 02:37:47.591
DISTRICT LED BY A BOARD OF

02:37:47.658 --> 02:37:50.494
TRUSTEES -- BUT I DO THINK THAT

02:37:50.561 --> 02:37:51.061
AND I JUST WANT TO REITERATE

02:37:51.128 --> 02:37:51.495
THAT I'M.

02:37:51.562 --> 02:37:52.629
WITH YOU KNOW THERE IS A SET OF

02:37:52.696 --> 02:37:54.698
STATUTES THAT WE EXPECT THE

02:37:54.765 --> 02:37:56.400
ONLINE COLLEGE TO COMPLY WITH

02:37:56.466 --> 02:37:57.768
THERE ARE ALSO WE KNOW

02:37:57.835 --> 02:37:59.436
COMMITMENTS THAT WE MADE TO

02:37:59.503 --> 02:38:00.737
OTHER COLLEGES IN OUR SYSTEM AND

02:38:00.804 --> 02:38:02.973
DO YOU ALL THAT WE WILL -- YOU

02:38:03.040 --> 02:38:04.641
KNOW THAT WE INTEND TO BE A

02:38:04.708 --> 02:38:05.809
VOICE AND MAKING SURE THAT THE

02:38:05.876 --> 02:38:07.277
COLLEGES LEADERSHIP UNDERSTANDS

02:38:07.344 --> 02:38:08.645
THAT THOSE COMMITMENTS WERE MADE.

02:38:08.712 --> 02:38:09.780
WELL I THINK THE ISSUE IS IN

02:38:09.847 --> 02:38:11.582
ABOUT TEN MINUTES WE'RE GONNA BE

02:38:11.648 --> 02:38:12.883
TALKING ABOUT HOW STUDENTS ARE.

02:38:12.950 --> 02:38:14.418
SLEEPING IN THEIR CARS AND

02:38:14.484 --> 02:38:15.953
THEY'RE HUNGRY YEAH AND WE HAVE

02:38:16.019 --> 02:38:17.688
A PROGRAM HERE THAT NOT A LOT OF

02:38:17.754 --> 02:38:19.623
US LIKE WE COULD EASILY TAKE A

02:38:19.690 --> 02:38:20.490
MOTION AND ELIMINATE THIS

02:38:20.557 --> 02:38:21.859
PROGRAM WITHIN THIRTY SECONDS

02:38:21.925 --> 02:38:23.060
THERE'S NOT MUCH OF A DESIRE TO

02:38:23.126 --> 02:38:25.896
HAVE THIS BUT THE PRIOR GOVERNOR.

02:38:25.963 --> 02:38:28.232
WAS INTERESTED IN THIS CURRENT

02:38:28.298 --> 02:38:29.366
ADMINISTRATION HAVE HEARD WHEN

02:38:29.433 --> 02:38:29.867
WHERE THE OTHER ANOTHER

02:38:29.933 --> 02:38:31.335
CHANCELLOR REALLY LIKES THIS BUT

02:38:31.401 --> 02:38:33.904
THERE'S A LOT OF SKEPTICISM AND

02:38:33.971 --> 02:38:35.939
WE'RE KIND OF GOING.

02:38:36.006 --> 02:38:38.709
ON A WIN HERE SO -- IF WE DID

02:38:38.775 --> 02:38:40.944

02:38:41.011 --> 02:38:42.412
WHEN WHEN DO YOU THINK THAT WE

02:38:42.479 --> 02:38:43.647

02:38:43.714 --> 02:38:45.282
WORTHWHILE INVESTMENTS WHEN WE

02:38:45.349 --> 02:38:48.018

02:38:50.454 --> 02:38:52.189
TO EAT TODAY AS OPPOSED TO GO

02:38:52.256 --> 02:38:53.523

CLASS YEAH THEY'RE THEY'RE EIGHT

02:38:55.425 --> 02:38:56.360
BETWEEN EIGHT AND TEN MILLION

CALIFORNIANS WHO ARE WORKING

THAT THERE IS A SYSTEMATIC

02:42:23.733 --> 02:42:25.735
PROBLEM THOUGH -- THAT COMMUNITY

02:42:25.802 --> 02:42:26.336
COLLEGE STUDENTS DON'T HAVE

ACCESS PRIMARILY TO THE

02:42:26.903 --> 02:42:29.706
FINANCIAL AID THAT'S NECESSARY --

02:42:29.773 --> 02:42:30.307

HEARD FROM THE LA CHANCELLOR.

02:45:21.177 --> 02:45:22.512
AN HOUR AGO.

02:45:22.579 --> 02:45:25.482
THAT OVER 90% OF THE COSTS FOR

02:45:25.548 --> 02:45:26.683
COMMUNITY CALLED STUDENT.

02:45:26.750 --> 02:45:28.818
IS A NON TUITION AND SO THAT'S

02:45:28.885 --> 02:45:30.153
THE FINANCIAL AID PIECE THAT

02:45:30.220 --> 02:45:31.554
THAT JUST DOESN'T.

02:45:31.621 --> 02:45:33.757
ADDRESS THAT POPULATION SO BUT I

02:45:33.823 --> 02:45:34.324
WOULD JUST EITHER WAY WE'RE

02:45:34.391 --> 02:45:35.292
WE'RE WORKING ON THAT AND I

02:45:35.358 --> 02:45:37.260
WOULD ARGUE IT'S BOTH NOT JUST

02:45:37.327 --> 02:45:38.628
THE BENEFIT LEVEL NOT THE HOW

02:45:38.695 --> 02:45:40.397
MUCH EACH STATE WOULD RECEIVE

02:45:40.463 --> 02:45:42.332

LESS THAN 5% RECEIVE CAL GRANTS

02:45:49.372 --> 02:45:51.041
BECAUSE CAL GRANTS TODAY SAY IN

02:45:51.107 --> 02:45:52.942
ORDER TO BE ELIGIBLE YOU NEED TO

02:45:53.009 --> 02:45:55.478
ENTER COLLEGE NO MORE THAN ONE

02:45:55.545 --> 02:45:56.079

THAT PERFORMANCE BASED FUNDING

02:55:33.756 --> 02:55:35.625

TRYING CREATE THIS VISION OF AN

02:56:27.510 --> 02:56:29.745
IDEA OF A UNREALISTIC COLLEGE

02:56:29.812 --> 02:56:31.113
STUDENTS THAT FITS A PERFECT

02:56:31.180 --> 02:56:32.481
MOLD OF BEING EIGHTEEN FRESH AT

A HIGH SCHOOL BEING SUPPORTED BY

THEIR FAMILY GOING STRAIGHT TO

02:56:35.651 --> 02:56:37.887
THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE OF BEING

02:56:37.954 --> 02:56:39.422
PUSHED OUT IN TWO YEARS -- AS

02:56:39.488 --> 02:56:40.957
MUCH AS WE MIGHT WANT TO DO THAT

02:56:41.023 --> 02:56:42.391
NOT EVERYONE HAS THE LIBERTY OR

PRIVILEGED TO BE ABLE.

02:56:44.460 --> 02:56:46.028
TO GO THROUGH SUCH AN EXPERIENCE --

02:56:46.095 --> 02:56:47.096
MANY OF US HAVE TO SUPPORT
