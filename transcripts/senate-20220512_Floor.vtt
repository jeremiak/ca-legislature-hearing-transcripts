LEGISLATURE TO ALLOW THEM TO DO

PARENTS. BOYS FRIDAY'S

00:13:13.893 --> 00:13:17.463
APPEARANCE. BUT WE ALSO KNOWN

00:13:17.530 --> 00:13:18.531
FORTY THERE ARE CIRCUMSTANCES IN

00:13:18.597 --> 00:13:20.900
WHICH- AND IT IS TRULY

00:13:20.966 --> 00:13:23.235
UNFORTUNATE AS A PHYSICIAN WHO'S

00:13:23.302 --> 00:13:25.738
HAD TO DEAL WITH CHILD ABUSE AND

00:13:25.804 --> 00:13:27.840
NEGLECT AND SO FORTH THAT

00:13:27.907 --> 00:13:29.942
SOMETIMES- PARENTS ALWAYS ACT IN

00:13:30.009 --> 00:13:31.644
THE BEST INTERESTS OF THE

00:13:31.710 --> 00:13:33.546
CHILDREN. BUT ACTUALLY EVEN MORE

00:13:33.612 --> 00:13:36.382
IMPORTANTLY OFTENTIMES PARENTS

00:13:36.448 --> 00:13:40.586
ARE TRYING THEIR BEST. BUT THEY

00:13:40.653 --> 00:13:43.088
MAY BE FOR A CERTAIN THEIR

00:13:43.155 --> 00:13:44.990
CIRCUMSTANCES THE MEDIA WAY

00:13:45.057 --> 00:13:46.392
RIGHT THERE MAY BE DIFFERENT

00:13:46.458 --> 00:13:47.326
FAMILY ARRANGEMENTS AND SO

00:13:47.393 --> 00:13:50.563
FORTH. THOSE BECOME BARRIERS TO

00:13:50.629 --> 00:13:53.399
THE USE GETTING CARE. SO WE

00:13:53.465 --> 00:13:54.867
TRIED IT WE CERTAINLY TRY TO

00:13:54.934 --> 00:13:55.935
ENGAGE THE PARENTS AND THE

00:13:56.001 --> 00:13:57.536
PARENTS READING GAUGE WITH US

00:13:57.603 --> 00:13:59.872
BUT SO FOR EXAMPLE YOU HAVE A

00:13:59.939 --> 00:14:02.041
MIGRANT FAMILY AND THE PARENTS

00:14:02.107 --> 00:14:03.409
HAPPEN TO BE WORKING AND IT'S

00:14:03.475 --> 00:14:05.077
NOT A COUNTY YOUR FATHER WHERE

00:14:05.144 --> 00:14:06.478
THEY CAN'T GET THERE. AND

00:14:06.545 --> 00:14:08.647
MEANWHILE THEIR GRANDPARENTS OR

00:14:08.714 --> 00:14:10.316
MAYBE AN OLDER SIBLING OR AN

00:14:10.382 --> 00:14:12.184
UNCLE OR ONCE PRIMARILY TAKING

00:14:12.251 --> 00:14:13.886
CARE OF THEM BUT YET THEY DON'T

00:14:13.953 --> 00:14:14.887
HAVE THE LEGAL AUTHORITY BECAUSE

00:14:14.954 --> 00:14:16.855
LISTEN NOW THEN GO TO COURT AND

00:14:16.922 --> 00:14:18.357
THAT IS BECAUSE THE PARENTS KNOW

00:14:18.424 --> 00:14:19.425
THE VENTS THE COMEBACK IN

00:14:19.491 --> 00:14:20.993
SERVICE. SO THESE BECOME

00:14:21.060 --> 00:14:26.799
BARRIERS TO CARE. AND ANSWER- I

00:14:26.865 --> 00:14:28.567
THINK WELL SOME. DO THIS BILL AS

00:14:28.634 --> 00:14:30.536
- THE SITUATION ONE WHICH- FOR

00:14:30.603 --> 00:14:32.671
EXAMPLE MAYBE A YOUTH IN THE

00:14:32.738 --> 00:14:35.107
PARENT MAY DISAGREE. ACTUALLY IS

00:14:35.174 --> 00:14:36.942
A PEACHES ALL TELL YOU THE MORE

00:14:37.009 --> 00:14:38.577
COMMON CIRCUMSTANCES IS THAT THE

00:14:38.644 --> 00:14:40.913
PARENT ACTUALLY AGREES. BUT THEY

00:14:40.980 --> 00:14:42.548
WERE YOU KNOW IT AGAIN THERE IS

00:14:42.615 --> 00:14:44.883
A MAYBE WORKING TWO JOBS IN THE

00:14:44.950 --> 00:14:46.218
CIRCUMSTANCE WHERE THEY WERE NOT

00:14:46.285 --> 00:14:48.354
ABLE TO ACCOMPANY THE TOWN. IN

00:14:48.420 --> 00:14:50.956
FACT A SIMPLE WHAT HAPPENS WHEN

00:14:51.023 --> 00:14:52.424
ACTUALLY TO TELL YOU WHAT YOU

00:14:52.491 --> 00:14:54.760
WORK FOR THE PAIR AND THEY GOT

00:14:54.827 --> 00:14:57.196
THEIR FIRST VACCINE. IS MANY

00:14:57.263 --> 00:14:58.564
VACCINES ARE SERIES. AND THEN

00:14:58.631 --> 00:15:00.199
BECOME FOR FOLLOW UP VISIT BUT

00:15:00.266 --> 00:15:01.667
BECAUSE THE PARENTS ARE TOO BUSY

00:15:01.734 --> 00:15:02.701
WITH THEIR JOBS OR OTHER

00:15:02.768 --> 00:15:04.303
CIRCUMSTANCES. THE PROPERTY

00:15:04.370 --> 00:15:05.738
LISTING OLDER SIBLING WHO

00:15:05.804 --> 00:15:08.073
HAPPENS TO BE YOU KNOW TWENTY

00:15:08.140 --> 00:15:09.441
BUT- DOES HAVE FOR THEIR

00:15:09.508 --> 00:15:11.277
GRANDPARENTS. AND THEN THE

00:15:11.343 --> 00:15:13.078
PROBLEM IS THE SHOP IN THE

00:15:13.145 --> 00:15:14.446
OFFICE AND I'VE SEEN THIS SO

00:15:14.513 --> 00:15:15.748
MANY TIMES. IT WAS LIKE SORRY WE

00:15:15.814 --> 00:15:18.350
CAN'T DO THIS. BECAUSE WE DON'T

00:15:18.417 --> 00:15:20.586
HAVE THE PARENTS HERE TO GIVE

00:15:20.653 --> 00:15:22.554
DIRECT PERMISSION AND WE TRY TO

00:15:22.621 --> 00:15:24.089
REACH THE PAIR BUT THEY'RE

00:15:24.156 --> 00:15:24.723
WORKING. THEY DON'T HAVE THE L.

00:15:24.790 --> 00:15:26.558
L. SOMEWHERE WHERE THEY'RE AT.

00:15:26.625 --> 00:15:28.060
WE KNOW CERTAINLY NO WORKERS

00:15:28.127 --> 00:15:29.261
WHERE DID ALLOWED TO KEEP CELL

00:15:29.328 --> 00:15:31.497
PHONES NEXT TO THEM ETCETERA.

00:15:31.563 --> 00:15:33.899
AND WE CAN'T REACH A GO SORRY

00:15:33.966 --> 00:15:34.433
AND MEANWHILE THE FAMILY

00:15:34.500 --> 00:15:36.635
CERTAINLY TOOK- TREMENDOUS

00:15:36.702 --> 00:15:38.037
EFFORTS TO BE SURE THEIR CHILD

00:15:38.103 --> 00:15:39.071
BECOMING DAY CARE AND

00:15:39.138 --> 00:15:42.241
UNFORTUNATELY THAT HASN'T. I

00:15:42.308 --> 00:15:43.609
WOULD ALSO KEEP IN MIND THAT

00:15:43.676 --> 00:15:44.777
WHILE CERTAINLY IN THIS

00:15:44.843 --> 00:15:46.445
CIRCUMSTANCE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT

00:15:46.512 --> 00:15:49.615
ALLOWING. TEENS USE. THE SELF

00:15:49.682 --> 00:15:52.751
CONSENT. IN ORDER FOR THEM TO

00:15:52.818 --> 00:15:54.687
GET THE SERVICES. THERE'S

00:15:54.753 --> 00:15:55.788
ACTUALLY A LICENSED HEALTH CARE

00:15:55.854 --> 00:15:57.523
PROFESSIONALS TO DELIVER IT AND

00:15:57.589 --> 00:15:58.590
HAS EXERCISED THEIR OWN

00:15:58.657 --> 00:16:00.726
PROFESSIONAL JUDGMENT THAT IT'S

00:16:00.793 --> 00:16:02.628
APPROPRIATE FOR THAT YOU. AND I

00:16:02.695 --> 00:16:04.163
THINK THAT'S ANOTHER LAYER OF

00:16:04.229 --> 00:16:07.466
PROTECTION. TO ENSURE THAT- THAT

00:16:07.533 --> 00:16:09.601
CERTAINLY IT'S NOT THAT THE USER

00:16:09.668 --> 00:16:11.437
CAN DECIDE I WANT ANYTHING I

00:16:11.503 --> 00:16:13.672
WANT. THERE'S ACTUALLY. A YEAH

00:16:13.739 --> 00:16:14.807
THE A LICENSED HEALTH CARE

00:16:14.873 --> 00:16:16.442
PROFESSIONAL SAYS THIS IS

00:16:16.508 --> 00:16:18.677
APPROPRIATE FOR YOU. AND I WOULD

00:16:18.744 --> 00:16:20.846
ALSO POINT OUT THAT THIS BILL IS

00:16:20.913 --> 00:16:22.014
PARTICULARLY FOCUSED ON GETTING

00:16:22.081 --> 00:16:23.549
VACCINES WHICH HAVE GONE THROUGH

00:16:23.615 --> 00:16:25.117
THE MOST RIGOROUS TESTING AND

00:16:25.184 --> 00:16:26.952
HAS A REQUIRES APPROVAL. AND

00:16:27.019 --> 00:16:30.055
RECOMMENDATION FROM EXPERTS LIKE

00:16:30.122 --> 00:16:31.223
ADVISING TO ME IN HIS ASIAN

00:16:31.290 --> 00:16:33.559
PRACTICES. AND THAT'S WHY BY THE

00:16:33.625 --> 00:16:35.794
WAY IN ADDITION TO BUT THIS BILL

00:16:35.861 --> 00:16:37.596
ADDRESSES JUST VACCINATIONS THAT

00:16:37.663 --> 00:16:41.667
ALREADY IN CALIFORNIA LAW. IN

00:16:41.734 --> 00:16:45.571
CALIFORNIA LAW. IF A TWELVE YEAR

00:16:45.637 --> 00:16:48.006
OLD SHOWS UP IN MY OFFICE. AND

00:16:48.073 --> 00:16:49.708
NOT ONLY DID THEY WANT OTHER

00:16:49.775 --> 00:16:51.443
VACCINES LIKE HPV AND HEPATITIS

00:16:51.510 --> 00:16:53.011
B. THEY CAN CONSENT TO IT. THEY

00:16:53.078 --> 00:16:55.347
WANNA TALK TO ME ABOUT THE NASTY

00:16:55.414 --> 00:17:01.920
D. DRUG USE- PREGNANCY. SEXUAL

00:17:01.987 --> 00:17:05.657
ASSAULT. I DON'T NEED TO GO ASK

00:17:05.724 --> 00:17:08.127
THE PARENTS BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT

00:17:08.193 --> 00:17:10.529
IT'S IMPORTANT THAT THOSE USED

00:17:10.596 --> 00:17:12.364
TO GET THE CARE AND THEY ALSO

00:17:12.431 --> 00:17:14.600
HAVE THE PRIVACY NECESSARY TO DO

00:17:14.666 --> 00:17:17.569
THAT. BUT I ALSO INCLUDES MENTAL

00:17:17.636 --> 00:17:19.271
HEALTH ISSUES THINKING ABOUT ALL

00:17:19.338 --> 00:17:19.872
THE MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES WERE

00:17:19.938 --> 00:17:21.640
STRUGGLING WITH RIGHT NOW. IN A

00:17:21.707 --> 00:17:22.841
FORTY THE STIGMA ATTACHED TO

00:17:22.908 --> 00:17:25.744
THAT. SO THIS BILL REALLY IS

00:17:25.811 --> 00:17:28.781
ABOUT. REDUCING THE BARRIERS TO

00:17:28.847 --> 00:17:33.519
GETTING LIFESAVING VACCINES AND

00:17:33.585 --> 00:17:35.721
CERTAINLY THERE'S NO MEDICAL OR

00:17:35.788 --> 00:17:37.489
SCIENCE BASED REASON WHY MINERS

00:17:37.556 --> 00:17:39.658
FORMER OLDER SHOULD NOT BE ABLE

00:17:39.725 --> 00:17:41.693
TO CONSENT TO THEM AGAIN AS A

00:17:41.760 --> 00:17:42.728
PEDIATRICIAN WHO STUDIES CHILD

00:17:42.795 --> 00:17:44.630
DEVELOPMENT THERE'S NO REASON TO

00:17:44.696 --> 00:17:46.198
THINK THAT A TWELVE YEAR OLD. BY

00:17:46.265 --> 00:17:47.733
LAW SHOULD BE ABLE TO CONSENT TO

00:17:47.800 --> 00:17:49.368
THEM AND CERTAINLY AGAIN WITH A

00:17:49.435 --> 00:17:49.802
LICENSED HEALTH CARE

00:17:49.868 --> 00:17:51.837
PROFESSIONALS IS EVALUATING

00:17:51.904 --> 00:17:54.006
THEIR STATE OF MIND AND THEIR

00:17:54.072 --> 00:17:56.375
CONDITION. I'LL POINT OUT THAT

00:17:56.442 --> 00:17:57.843
MANY OF THE PEOPLE OPPOSE THE

00:17:57.910 --> 00:17:59.211
TWO TEENS CHEESE VACCINES ACT

00:17:59.278 --> 00:18:02.314
ALSO OPPOSE ABORTION ACCESS. IN

00:18:02.381 --> 00:18:03.782
THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATURE MUST

00:18:03.849 --> 00:18:05.384
HOLD THE LINE AGAINST FIGHTING

00:18:05.451 --> 00:18:07.586
AGAINST AGENCY FOR WOMEN YOUNG

00:18:07.653 --> 00:18:10.589
PEOPLE. FOR THAT REASON THE

00:18:10.656 --> 00:18:12.925
ASIAN CENTER VACCINES MUST BE

00:18:12.991 --> 00:18:13.659
TWELVE WHICH IS WHAT IT

00:18:13.725 --> 00:18:17.062
CURRENTLY IS NOW. WE DO NOT KNOW

00:18:17.129 --> 00:18:18.230
. THE CONSEQUENCES WERE ABORTION

00:18:18.297 --> 00:18:20.165
ACCESS WITH AN OSCAR IF WOULD BE

00:18:20.232 --> 00:18:21.767
IF WE START MAKING DECISIONS FOR

00:18:21.834 --> 00:18:23.469
POLITICAL REASONS AND NOT

00:18:23.535 --> 00:18:26.171
SCIENTIFIC ONES. SO THIS REALLY

00:18:26.238 --> 00:18:27.940
IS ABOUT MAKING IT EASIER FOR

00:18:28.006 --> 00:18:29.441
YOUNG PEOPLE TO GIVE VACCINES IT

00:18:29.508 --> 00:18:31.443
SHOULD BE A GOOD THING. AND WE

00:18:31.510 --> 00:18:32.578
ALSO WANT TO INCREASE HEALTHCARE

00:18:32.644 --> 00:18:33.545
EQUITY BECAUSE AGAIN IT'S

00:18:33.612 --> 00:18:35.547
USUALLY THE FAMILIES THAT ARE

00:18:35.614 --> 00:18:36.849
MOST DISADVANTAGED OF THE

00:18:36.915 --> 00:18:37.449
LARGEST BARRIERS TO GETTING

00:18:37.516 --> 00:18:38.984
VACCINATIONS INCLUDING BY THE

00:18:39.051 --> 00:18:41.487
WAY GETTING CAN. THIS- CONSENT

00:18:41.553 --> 00:18:43.889
SO WHAT IS TIME OFF WORK FOR A

00:18:43.956 --> 00:18:44.723
WELLNESS VISIT OUR FORGOTTEN

00:18:44.790 --> 00:18:46.358
PAPERWORK. ANY CHANGE THAT MAKES

00:18:46.425 --> 00:18:48.393
IT EASIER TO GIVE ACTUALLY IS

00:18:48.460 --> 00:18:50.395
THE ONE WE MUST TAKE. AND WE OF

00:18:50.462 --> 00:18:51.930
COURSE KNOW HOW FOR VACCINATIONS

00:18:51.997 --> 00:18:54.266
ARE TOO NOR PROTECTING THE

00:18:54.333 --> 00:18:56.368
CHILD'S HEALTH BE SURE THAT THEY

00:18:56.435 --> 00:18:57.536
CAN GO TO. THAT THE AMOUNTS IN A

00:18:57.603 --> 00:19:00.205
HOSPITAL. HIGH RISK FAMILY

00:19:00.272 --> 00:19:02.040
MEMBERS RIGHT I MEAN.

00:19:02.107 --> 00:19:03.375
TRANSACTION OFTEN UNTIL WE GETS

00:19:03.442 --> 00:19:06.678
A PARTICULAR PEOPLE YOUR FAMILY

00:19:06.745 --> 00:19:07.713
. SO THIS IS AGAIN VERY

00:19:07.779 --> 00:19:09.581
IMPORTANT TO ENSURE WE HAVE

00:19:09.648 --> 00:19:11.583
APPROPRIATE ACCESS. TO

00:19:11.650 --> 00:19:13.619
LIFESAVING PREVENTION FOR

00:19:13.685 --> 00:19:16.154
CHILDREN. AND WHAT THAT THAT'S

00:19:16.221 --> 00:19:18.423
WHY NOT ONLY OF COURSE. AM I

00:19:18.490 --> 00:19:20.826
SPEAKING IN FAVOR OF IT MY

00:19:20.893 --> 00:19:21.593
COLLEAGUES IN MY PROFESSION ARE

00:19:21.660 --> 00:19:23.395
SO YOU DON'T LISTEN TO THIS ONE

00:19:23.462 --> 00:19:25.330
PEDIATRICIAN HERE TO HAVE THIS

00:19:25.397 --> 00:19:27.533

AUTHORIZES BALI ECONOMY THAT

THE TEENS USE AXES ACT AS AN

00:19:48.220 --> 00:19:50.622
IMPORTANT TOOL THAT WE NEED TO

00:19:50.689 --> 00:19:52.424
REDUCE THE BARRIER VACCINATIONS

00:19:52.491 --> 00:19:55.227
I STRICTLY ASPEN EITHER THANK

PRESIDENT YOU'RE DOING A FINE

00:20:06.538 --> 00:20:07.773
JOB TODAY I MIGHT ADD. OUR

00:20:07.839 --> 00:20:11.577
COLLEAGUES. THIS IS CERTAINLY A

00:20:11.643 --> 00:20:15.147
DIFFICULT ISSUE- BUT IF WE WERE

00:20:15.213 --> 00:20:16.882
TO GO BACK IN TIME WHEN WE WERE

00:20:16.949 --> 00:20:17.816
GOING TO THE FIRST YEAR OF

00:20:17.883 --> 00:20:20.419
COATED- IN CERTAINLY INTO THE

00:20:20.485 --> 00:20:22.754
SECOND WE WERE TRYING TO FIGURE

00:20:22.821 --> 00:20:25.424
OUT WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO IN

00:20:25.490 --> 00:20:28.126
TERMS OF AXING POLICY. I

00:20:28.193 --> 00:20:29.628
CONSULTED WITH MY FAMILY DOCTOR

00:20:29.695 --> 00:20:31.897
AND CONSULT WITH MY FAMILY AND

00:20:31.964 --> 00:20:34.299
FRIENDS. AND I PERSONALLY

00:20:34.366 --> 00:20:35.801
BELIEVE THAT VACCINES WERE THE

00:20:35.867 --> 00:20:39.037
BEST PATH FORWARD FOR ME AND MY

00:20:39.104 --> 00:20:41.607
FAMILY IN SPECIFICALLY MY TWO

00:20:41.673 --> 00:20:45.444
YOUNG BOYS AGE TEN AND EIGHT.

00:20:45.510 --> 00:20:50.048
THIS BILL. I BELIEVE THAT WORK

00:20:50.115 --> 00:20:51.783
IS GOING TO HAVE MANY UNINTENDED

00:20:51.850 --> 00:20:54.853
CONSEQUENCES. THE FIRST OF WHICH

00:20:54.920 --> 00:20:57.322
WHAT IS THE ROLE OF THE PARENT

00:20:57.389 --> 00:21:00.592
AND WHAT IS THE LEGAL AGE OF

00:21:00.659 --> 00:21:02.461
MAJORITY WHAT DOES THAT MEAN.

00:21:02.527 --> 00:21:04.329
BECAUSE AS WE'VE HEARD BEFORE

00:21:04.396 --> 00:21:06.398
THAT YOU CAN BE TWELVE YEARS OLD

00:21:06.465 --> 00:21:08.433
TO GET CERTAIN- MEDICAL

00:21:08.500 --> 00:21:10.535
TREATMENT WE'LL HAVE TO BE A

00:21:10.602 --> 00:21:12.604
DIFFERENT AGE TO VOTE OR SERVE

00:21:12.671 --> 00:21:14.473
IN THE MILITARY AND YET ANOTHER

00:21:14.539 --> 00:21:18.176
AGE TO BUY TO BUY ALCOHOL OR

00:21:18.243 --> 00:21:20.345
SMOKE CIGARETTES. SOMEWHERE

00:21:20.412 --> 00:21:22.547
BETWEEN TWELVE AND TWENTY ONE IS

00:21:22.614 --> 00:21:24.583
THE AGE OF MAJORITY IN

00:21:24.650 --> 00:21:25.784
CALIFORNIA WE JUST CAN'T FIGURE

00:21:25.851 --> 00:21:27.919
OUT WHICH ONE WE WANT. AND WHICH

00:21:27.986 --> 00:21:29.755
ONES MOST APPLICABLE. BUT FOR

00:21:29.821 --> 00:21:31.556
THIS PURPOSE FOR THIS PARTICULAR

00:21:31.623 --> 00:21:34.793
BILL. MY CONCERN IS THAT WE

00:21:34.860 --> 00:21:37.229
HEARD IN JUDICIARY PEOPLE CALL

00:21:37.295 --> 00:21:39.564
IN WE ALSO HEARD FROM OUR STEAM

00:21:39.631 --> 00:21:42.300
TO- PHYSICIAN ARE ALSO A MEMBER

00:21:42.367 --> 00:21:45.003
OF THIS BODY. THAT THIS IS GOING

00:21:45.070 --> 00:21:47.139
TO MAKE LIFE EASIER BECAUSE A

00:21:47.205 --> 00:21:49.007
LOT OF TIMES THESE INDIVIDUALS

00:21:49.074 --> 00:21:51.343
THESE CHILDREN CAN'T GET

00:21:51.410 --> 00:21:52.411
PARENTAL PERMISSION BECAUSE

00:21:52.477 --> 00:21:54.579
MAYBE THE PARENTS WORK OUTSIDE

00:21:54.646 --> 00:21:56.848
THE AREA WHERE THEY'RE BUSY OR

00:21:56.915 --> 00:22:00.752
TO SINGLE MOM WORKING TWO JOBS.

00:22:00.819 --> 00:22:02.654
THAT ENTIRE SCENARIO CAN BE

00:22:02.721 --> 00:22:04.589
RESOLVED ADMINISTRATIVELY. BY

00:22:04.656 --> 00:22:07.159
HAVING A SIGN OFF PROGRAM THAT

00:22:07.225 --> 00:22:08.660
AUTHORIZES THE PAIR TO STILL

00:22:08.727 --> 00:22:10.462
MAKE THE DECISION IN THE BEST

00:22:10.529 --> 00:22:11.863
INTEREST OF THE CHILD AND THE

00:22:11.930 --> 00:22:14.433
CHILD BE BE GIVEN ACCESS TO THE

00:22:14.499 --> 00:22:15.934
VACCINE. SO LET'S NOT KID

00:22:16.001 --> 00:22:18.036
OURSELVES THAT BUT THIS IS THE

00:22:18.103 --> 00:22:19.938
ONLY WAY FORWARD ON THIS ISSUE.

00:22:20.005 --> 00:22:21.840
PARENTAL CONSENT CAN BE GIVEN

00:22:21.907 --> 00:22:23.008
AND THEY CAN BE EXPEDITED IN

00:22:23.075 --> 00:22:25.844
ADMINISTRATIVE FASHION BUT I

00:22:25.911 --> 00:22:27.746
HAVEN'T HEARD US TALK TOO MUCH

00:22:27.813 --> 00:22:28.880
ABOUT THAT. I'VE ALSO HEARD

00:22:28.947 --> 00:22:30.849
THAT- THIS ISSUE IS ABOUT

00:22:30.916 --> 00:22:35.854
FOLLOWING. EXISTING LEGISLATION

00:22:35.921 --> 00:22:38.190
. WITH THAT IS THE RATIONALE.

00:22:38.256 --> 00:22:39.591
IT'S HARD NOT TO IMAGINE THAT

00:22:39.658 --> 00:22:40.892
EXISTING LEGISLATION WASN'T

00:22:40.959 --> 00:22:43.195
DELIBERATELY PUT INTO INTO A

00:22:43.261 --> 00:22:45.130
FACT FOR THE VERY PURPOSE OF

00:22:45.197 --> 00:22:46.865
OPENING THE DOOR FOR

00:22:46.932 --> 00:22:50.135
SUBSEQUENTLY LEGISLATION. SO I

00:22:50.202 --> 00:22:52.437
HAVE I HAVE AN ABSOLUTE HORROR

00:22:52.504 --> 00:22:55.574
TIME. TRYING TO RECONCILE THIS

00:22:55.640 --> 00:22:57.275
BECAUSE IF WE CONTINUE DOWN THIS

00:22:57.342 --> 00:22:59.611
PATH I IMAGINE A YEAR FROM NOW

00:22:59.678 --> 00:23:02.013
OR TWO YEARS FROM NOW. THIS SAME

00:23:02.080 --> 00:23:03.949
ISSUE OF TWELVE YEAR OLD CONSENT

00:23:04.015 --> 00:23:06.318
WILL SOMEHOW FIND ITS WAY INTO

00:23:06.384 --> 00:23:08.920
CLINICAL TRIALS. RIGHT NOW IT

00:23:08.987 --> 00:23:11.423
HAS TO BE FTA APPROVED. BUT IN

00:23:11.490 --> 00:23:13.525
TWO YEARS FROM NOW. IT'S ONLY A

00:23:13.592 --> 00:23:15.193
MATTER TIME BEFORE CERTAIN

00:23:15.260 --> 00:23:16.795
PHARMACEUTICAL POWERS IN

00:23:16.862 --> 00:23:19.331
INTEREST WANTING TO- TO BUILD UP

00:23:19.397 --> 00:23:21.299
A BODY OF SCHOLARSHIP IN A

00:23:21.366 --> 00:23:22.934
CERTAIN AREA ARE GOING TO WANT

00:23:23.001 --> 00:23:24.202
TO MAKE CERTAIN THE CLINICAL

00:23:24.269 --> 00:23:26.404
TRIALS CAN BE ACHIEVED. BY THE

00:23:26.471 --> 00:23:28.940
CONSENTING PRINCIPAL WHO HAPPENS

00:23:29.007 --> 00:23:31.309
TO BE TWELVE YEARS OLD. AS A

00:23:31.376 --> 00:23:34.412
PARENT. THIS IS DEEPLY TROUBLING

00:23:34.479 --> 00:23:37.315
TO ME. N. AS A PARENT WHO

00:23:37.382 --> 00:23:40.752
BELIEVES THAT VACCINES. I DON'T

00:23:40.819 --> 00:23:42.754
THINK THIS IS THE RIGHT PATH

00:23:42.821 --> 00:23:44.656
FORWARD BECAUSE I THINK YOU CAN

00:23:44.723 --> 00:23:46.691
ACHIEVE THE MAJORITY OF WHAT.

00:23:46.758 --> 00:23:48.493
YOUR CONSTITUENTS IN CALL INS

00:23:48.560 --> 00:23:50.962
AND COLLEAGUES HAVE SAID THIS

00:23:51.029 --> 00:23:53.165
CAN BE DONE ADMINISTRATIVELY. I

00:23:53.231 --> 00:23:54.833
DON'T THINK WE SPEND ENOUGH TIME

00:23:54.900 --> 00:23:57.269
ON ON ON THAT ON THAT ISSUE. AND

00:23:57.335 --> 00:24:03.241
SO. I GUESS. I GUESS I WILL

00:24:03.308 --> 00:24:04.042
CONCLUDE WITH THIS COLLEAGUES

00:24:04.109 --> 00:24:06.711
THAT FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO ARE

00:24:06.778 --> 00:24:08.013
PARENTS OR HAVE LEGAL

00:24:08.079 --> 00:24:11.149
GUARDIANSHIP OVER CHILDREN YOU

00:24:11.216 --> 00:24:12.717
HAVE CERTAIN RESPONSIBILITIES.

00:24:12.784 --> 00:24:16.188
YOU ARE EXPECTED TO OVERSEE AND

00:24:16.254 --> 00:24:20.025
TAKE AGENCY OF THAT MINOR. THIS

00:24:20.091 --> 00:24:22.527
LAW IN THE ENTIRE CADRE OF

00:24:22.594 --> 00:24:25.530
ASSOCIATED LAWS THAT ARE MAKING

00:24:25.597 --> 00:24:28.400
LEGAL CONSENT THE H. TWELVE IS

00:24:28.466 --> 00:24:30.635
DOING AWAY WITH ALL OF THAT. SO

00:24:30.702 --> 00:24:33.038
AS A PARENT YOU HAVE FULL LEGAL

00:24:33.104 --> 00:24:35.440

AFTER THE BACKS NATION I WOULD

00:25:28.126 --> 00:25:29.861
SAY. THAT'S A VERY GOOD MEDICAL

00:25:29.928 --> 00:25:32.764
REASON- NOT TO MENTION THE

00:25:32.831 --> 00:25:35.901
MEDICAL REASON FOR WHEN A CHILD

MIGHT- CAUSE AN ADVERSE EFFECT

00:25:44.676 --> 00:25:46.211
AFTER GETTING A PARTICULAR

00:25:46.278 --> 00:25:48.113
VACCINATION AND THAT MINOR CHILD

00:25:48.179 --> 00:25:49.381
NOT TELLING THE PERSON

00:25:49.447 --> 00:25:51.016
MINISTERING THE VACCINE IF

THEY'RE TAKING THAT MEDICATION

00:25:52.350 --> 00:25:53.618
OR THAT THEY HAVE THAT FAMILY

HISTORY OR THAT THEY HAVE THAT

00:25:55.553 --> 00:25:57.389
PARTICULAR MEDICAL CONDITION. IF

00:25:57.455 --> 00:25:58.490
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT A TWELVE

00:25:58.556 --> 00:26:00.625
YEAR OLD I MEAN. YOU KNOW MANY

00:26:00.692 --> 00:26:02.661
OF YOU IN HERE HAVE KIDS SOME OF

LIKE I DO AND YOU KNOW THE KIDS

00:26:06.498 --> 00:26:07.966
THAT YOUNG I HAD DIFFICULTY

00:26:08.033 --> 00:26:08.633
REMEMBERING A LOT OF THINGS LET

00:26:08.700 --> 00:26:10.135

THAT THEY MAY HAVE THAT THEY

00:26:14.873 --> 00:26:19.444
WOULD NEED TO DIVULGE. TO THE

00:26:19.511 --> 00:26:20.512
PERSON ADMINISTERING THE

00:26:20.578 --> 00:26:22.013
VACCINES. NOT TO MENTION IF THIS

00:26:22.080 --> 00:26:24.115
MINOR CHILD GOES AND GETS THIS

00:26:24.182 --> 00:26:26.518
VACCINATION. AND DOESN'T TELL

00:26:26.584 --> 00:26:28.219
THEIR PARENTS HOW IN THE WORLD

00:26:28.286 --> 00:26:29.621
AS A PARENT SUPPOSED TO BE ABLE

00:26:29.688 --> 00:26:31.890
TO RECOGNIZE THAT SOMETHING IS

00:26:31.957 --> 00:26:34.225
GOING WRONG AFTER GETTING THAT

00:26:34.292 --> 00:26:35.327
BACKS THE NATION HOW WOULD A

00:26:35.393 --> 00:26:36.761
PARENT KNOW THAT THAT'S WHAT IT

00:26:36.828 --> 00:26:38.496
IS CAUSED BY AND THEN KNOW HOW

00:26:38.563 --> 00:26:40.899
TO SEEK THE PROPER MEDICAL CARE

00:26:40.966 --> 00:26:42.334
PARTICULARLY IF AS MANY HAVE

00:26:42.400 --> 00:26:44.469
POINTED OUT THERE ARE PARENTS

00:26:44.536 --> 00:26:46.638
WHO ARE JUST TOO BUSY. TO TAKE

00:26:46.705 --> 00:26:47.572
THEIR KIDS TO GET NEEDED WILL OF

00:26:47.639 --> 00:26:49.541
THE PAYMENTS ARE BUSY AND

00:26:49.607 --> 00:26:51.643
WORKING AND NOT THERE TO SEE

00:26:51.710 --> 00:26:52.711
THAT THERE'S SOME SORT OF

00:26:52.777 --> 00:26:53.778
ADVERSE REACTION. HOW ARE THEY

00:26:53.845 --> 00:26:55.513
GOING TO HELP THEM IF THE

00:26:55.580 --> 00:26:57.248
PARENTS DON'T KNOW THAT THE

00:26:57.315 --> 00:26:57.983
CHILD GOT THE VACCINATION. HOW

00:26:58.049 --> 00:26:59.551
WOULD THEY KNOW TO EVEN KEEP AN

00:26:59.617 --> 00:27:01.453
EYE OUT FOR IT TO WATCH FOR IT.

00:27:01.519 --> 00:27:03.722
THEY ARE AT THEIR SECOND JOB

00:27:03.788 --> 00:27:05.290
MAYBE PERHAPS TELL AN OLDER

00:27:05.357 --> 00:27:05.957
SIBLING OR THEIR CARETAKER. HEY

00:27:06.024 --> 00:27:07.492
KEEP AN EYE OUT FOR ANY ANY OF

00:27:07.559 --> 00:27:10.195
THESE SORTS OF SYMPTOMS IN MY

00:27:10.261 --> 00:27:11.363
CHILD THEY WOULDN'T KNOW THAT.

00:27:11.429 --> 00:27:13.164
THEY WOULDN'T KNOW THAT. AND I

00:27:13.231 --> 00:27:15.100
THINK THAT IS UNFAIR. AND

00:27:15.166 --> 00:27:17.836
UNREASONABLE. TO DO TO A CHILD

00:27:17.902 --> 00:27:20.105
OR TO ANY PARENT OUT THERE HE

00:27:20.171 --> 00:27:21.973
JUST WANTS TO KEEP THEIR CHILD

00:27:22.040 --> 00:27:23.742
SAFE. IRRESPECTIVE OF WHETHER OR

00:27:23.808 --> 00:27:25.377
NOT THEY BELIEVE IN ANY

00:27:25.443 --> 00:27:26.644
PARTICULAR VACCINE BECAUSE

00:27:26.711 --> 00:27:28.146
THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF DISCUSSION

00:27:28.213 --> 00:27:29.481
ABOUT THIS BEING ABOUT THE

00:27:29.547 --> 00:27:30.849
COVERT VACCINE BUT THIS BILL

00:27:30.915 --> 00:27:32.584
DOESN'T RELATE ONLY TO THE KOBE

00:27:32.650 --> 00:27:34.753
VACCINE ALTHOUGH I THINK THAT'S

00:27:34.819 --> 00:27:36.087
LARGELY WHAT HAS DOMINATED

00:27:36.154 --> 00:27:39.290
PEOPLE'S MINDS. THIS POINT. I'M

00:27:39.357 --> 00:27:41.026
THE OTHER ISSUE WITH THIS BILL

00:27:41.092 --> 00:27:42.594
IS I'M NOT ENTIRELY SURE THAT

00:27:42.660 --> 00:27:47.665
IT'S- LEGAL. D. NATIONAL

00:27:47.732 --> 00:27:51.002
CHILDHOOD VACCINE INJURY ACT

00:27:51.069 --> 00:27:52.937
STATES EACH HEALTH CARE PROVIDER

00:27:53.004 --> 00:27:54.806
WHO ADMINISTERED- ADMINISTERS A

00:27:54.873 --> 00:27:56.474
VACCINE SET FORTH IN THE VACCINE

CHILD OR TO ANY OTHER INDIVIDUAL

00:28:03.715 --> 00:28:05.316
TO HIM SUCH. VAIDER INTENDS TO

00:28:05.383 --> 00:28:07.352
ADMINISTER SUCH FAXING A COPY OF

00:28:07.419 --> 00:28:08.286

VISUAL PRESENTATIONS ARE ORAL

EXPLANATIONS IN APPROPRIATE

00:28:13.091 --> 00:28:15.093
CASES AND IT HAS TO BE

00:28:15.160 --> 00:28:16.127
ADMINISTERED PRIOR TO GIVING THE

00:28:16.194 --> 00:28:20.665
VACCINE. SO IF YOU GIVE. A MINOR

00:28:20.732 --> 00:28:23.701
THIS. VACCINATION AND YOU HAND

00:28:23.768 --> 00:28:25.403
THEM THE BOOKLET OF ALL THE

00:28:25.470 --> 00:28:27.439
DIFFERENT ADVERSE REACTIONS THAT

00:28:27.505 --> 00:28:30.442
MAY TAKE PLACE. DO YOU TRUST

00:28:30.508 --> 00:28:34.045
THAT THAT MINOR WILL REDUCE. DO

00:28:34.112 --> 00:28:35.680
YOU TRUST THAT THAT MINOR WILL

00:28:35.747 --> 00:28:36.848
GIVE IT TO AN ADULT IN THEIR

00:28:36.915 --> 00:28:39.717
LIFE WHO MAY BE WATCHING OVER

00:28:39.784 --> 00:28:41.319
THEM THAT THEY WILL GIVE IT TO

00:28:41.386 --> 00:28:43.021
THEM. PROBABLY NOT. PARTICULARLY

00:28:43.088 --> 00:28:44.589
IF THEIR PARENTS ARE THERE ARE

00:28:44.656 --> 00:28:45.790
THEIR HEALTH OR THEIR THEIR

00:28:45.857 --> 00:28:47.058
PROVIDER THEIR YOU KNOW

00:28:47.125 --> 00:28:48.460
WHOEVER'STAKING CARE OF THEM.

00:28:48.526 --> 00:28:49.894
DOESN'T EVEN KNOW THEY'RE

00:28:49.961 --> 00:28:50.962
GETTING IT YOUR THIS PUTS

00:28:51.029 --> 00:28:53.064
CHILDREN AT RISK BY NOW. THERE

00:28:53.131 --> 00:28:56.034
ARE. PEOPLE IN THIS ROOM WHO

00:28:56.101 --> 00:28:58.169
FIRMLY BELIEVE THAT EVERY CHILD

00:28:58.236 --> 00:29:00.105
SHOULD GET THIS VACCINE WEATHERS

00:29:00.171 --> 00:29:02.006
THE COVERT VACCINE OR ANY OTHER.

00:29:02.073 --> 00:29:04.476
I UNDERSTAND THAT BUT I THINK

00:29:04.542 --> 00:29:05.477
YOU'RE NOT LOOKING AT THE

00:29:05.543 --> 00:29:07.445
REALITY OF THE SITUATION WHICH

00:29:07.512 --> 00:29:09.247
IS THIS COULD ACTUALLY CAUSE.

00:29:09.314 --> 00:29:11.149
VERY SERIOUS HARM TO CHILDREN

00:29:11.216 --> 00:29:12.951
THERE IS A REASON THAT THERE IS

00:29:13.017 --> 00:29:15.186
A DATABASE THAT TRACKS ADVERSE

00:29:15.253 --> 00:29:17.188
REACTIONS TO VACCINATIONS NOT

00:29:17.255 --> 00:29:19.057
JUST THE KOBE BAXEEN BUT ALL

00:29:19.124 --> 00:29:20.592
VACCINATIONS THERE'S A REASON

00:29:20.658 --> 00:29:21.793
FOR THAT THERE'S A REASON THERE

00:29:21.860 --> 00:29:23.828
IS A FUND HAS BEEN SET UP. THAT

00:29:23.895 --> 00:29:25.663
HAS PAID OUT NEARLY FIVE BILLION

00:29:25.730 --> 00:29:28.466
DOLLARS. TO THOSE HAVE BEEN

00:29:28.533 --> 00:29:31.369
INJURED OR- DIED. FROM THE

00:29:31.436 --> 00:29:32.670
ADMINISTRATION OF THE VACCINE

00:29:32.737 --> 00:29:34.839
ALMOST FIVE BILLION DOLLARS. WHY

00:29:34.906 --> 00:29:36.875
IS THAT BECAUSE THESE THINGS DO

00:29:36.941 --> 00:29:39.544
HAPPEN. LARGELY VACCINATIONS ARE

00:29:39.611 --> 00:29:41.146
ADMINISTERED IN THERE ARE NO

00:29:41.212 --> 00:29:42.947
SERIOUS SIDE EFFECTS BUT GUESS

00:29:43.014 --> 00:29:44.549
WHAT THERE MANY OTHER INSTANCES

00:29:44.616 --> 00:29:46.551
WHERE THERE ARE SO I AM ASKING

00:29:46.618 --> 00:29:48.753
YOU. TO PLEASE CONSIDER THE

00:29:48.820 --> 00:29:50.088
HEALTH OF THESE CHILDREN PLEASE

00:29:50.155 --> 00:29:51.623
CONSIDER THAT YOU ARE PUTTING

00:29:51.689 --> 00:29:54.159
PARENTS IN A TERRIBLE SITUATION

00:29:54.225 --> 00:29:56.027
WHERE THEY WOULD HAVE NO IDEA

00:29:56.094 --> 00:29:57.295
THAT THEIR CHILD MIGHT BE HAVING

00:29:57.362 --> 00:29:58.997
SOME SORT OF REACTION TO THIS

00:29:59.063 --> 00:30:00.832
VACCINE AND HAVE NO ABILITY TO

00:30:00.899 --> 00:30:02.167
HELP THEM BECAUSE THEY DON'T

00:30:02.233 --> 00:30:04.569
EVEN KNOW THAT IT'S GOING ON. I

00:30:04.636 --> 00:30:06.871
URGE YOU KNOW ABOUT. THANK YOU

00:30:06.938 --> 00:30:15.346
SIR MELENDEZ CENTER OTOBO. THANK

00:30:15.413 --> 00:30:18.716
YOU MR PRESIDENT AND MEMBERS.

00:30:18.783 --> 00:30:21.052
TAKING A FULL BREATH BECAUSE I

00:30:21.119 --> 00:30:23.421
WANT MY ADRENALINE TO COME DOWN

00:30:23.488 --> 00:30:24.622
MY HEART'S BEATING SO FAST RIGHT

00:30:24.689 --> 00:30:27.458
NOW. AND I WE HAD SOME NOTES

00:30:27.525 --> 00:30:29.527
BECAUSE I KNEW THAT I WOULD GET

00:30:29.594 --> 00:30:31.729
REALLY RILED UP IN I WANT TO BE

00:30:31.796 --> 00:30:32.764
FRONTAL LOBE THINKING AND NOT

00:30:32.830 --> 00:30:34.632
PRIMAL IN MY BRAIN OF TRYING TO

00:30:34.699 --> 00:30:37.101
EXPRESS MY THOUGHTS THIS MORNING

00:30:37.168 --> 00:30:39.938
TO MY COLLEAGUES. WHO I.

00:30:40.004 --> 00:30:44.375
WHOLEHEARTEDLY RESPECT. WHILE I

00:30:44.442 --> 00:30:45.977
BELIEVE THAT AXES ARE AN

00:30:46.044 --> 00:30:47.812
IMPORTANT PUBLIC HEALTH TOOL

00:30:47.879 --> 00:30:50.815
THAT WE HAVE. AND ENCOURAGE ALL

00:30:50.882 --> 00:30:51.816
TO CONSULT WITH THEIR DOCTORS

00:30:51.883 --> 00:30:54.085
AND CONSIDER GETTING VACCINATED.

00:30:54.152 --> 00:30:55.920
I RISE TODAY IS APPARENT WITH

00:30:55.987 --> 00:30:58.189
STRONG CONCERNS ABOUT THE

00:30:58.256 --> 00:31:00.625
IMPLICATIONS OF THIS MEASURE.

00:31:00.692 --> 00:31:02.427
THIS BILL WOULD EMPOWER

00:31:02.493 --> 00:31:03.628
VULNERABLE POPULATIONS OF

00:31:03.695 --> 00:31:05.830
CHILDREN TO CONSENT TO MEDICAL

00:31:05.897 --> 00:31:07.298
TREATMENT THAT THEY LIKELY KNOW

00:31:07.365 --> 00:31:09.067
LITTLE ABOUT WITHOUT THE

00:31:09.133 --> 00:31:10.868
GUIDANCE OR KNOWLEDGE OF A CARE

00:31:10.935 --> 00:31:13.738
GIVER OR PARENTS. AT TWELVE

00:31:13.805 --> 00:31:15.773
YEARS OF AGE I TELL THE BRAIN IS

00:31:15.840 --> 00:31:17.675
STILL FORMING AND THEIR

00:31:17.742 --> 00:31:19.744
REASONING SKILLS ARE NOT ALWAYS

00:31:19.811 --> 00:31:23.281
FULLY DEVELOPED. I THINK WE CAN

00:31:23.348 --> 00:31:26.684
ALL AGREE ON THAT. A MINOR. IS

00:31:26.751 --> 00:31:28.419
ANY PERSON BELOW THE AGE OF

00:31:28.486 --> 00:31:30.521
ADULTHOOD WHO IS STILL LEGALLY

00:31:30.588 --> 00:31:33.124
UNDER THE AUTHORITY AND

00:31:33.191 --> 00:31:37.028
SUPERVISION OF THEIR PARENTS. DO

00:31:37.095 --> 00:31:39.998
WE HEAR THAT A MINOR. LEGAL

00:31:40.064 --> 00:31:45.737
DEFINITION. AN EMANCIPATED MINOR

00:31:45.803 --> 00:31:47.038
IS ONE WHO HAS PROVEN TO THE

00:31:47.105 --> 00:31:49.507
COURT THAT THEY ARE MATURE

00:31:49.574 --> 00:31:50.575
ENOUGH TO MAKE THEIR OWN

00:31:50.642 --> 00:31:53.878
DECISIONS. OWN DECISIONS MANAGE

00:31:53.945 --> 00:31:55.513
THEIR FINANCES AND THAT

00:31:55.580 --> 00:31:58.283
EMANCIPATION IS THE BEST PATH

KNOW THEIR CHILDREN BEST. WHICH

00:32:08.026 --> 00:32:09.193
IS WHY THEY ARE CURRENTLY

00:32:09.260 --> 00:32:11.562
REQUIRED TO FURNISH INFORMATION

00:32:11.629 --> 00:32:12.830

PENICILLIN BECAUSE OF THAT

00:32:25.443 --> 00:32:27.445
REACTION THAT HAS A BABY. UNTIL

WITH SIGNIFICANT PAPERWORK

00:32:39.624 --> 00:32:41.826
REGARDING SIDE EFFECTS TO EACH

BILL IF A MINOR CHILD CONSENTS

00:32:53.271 --> 00:32:54.939
TO VACCINATION WITHOUT PARENTAL

00:32:55.006 --> 00:32:57.942
KNOWLEDGE AND HAVE A REACTION

00:32:58.009 --> 00:33:00.011
THE PARENT MAY NOT RECOGNIZE THE

00:33:00.078 --> 00:33:02.280
VACCINE REACTION SYMPTOMS WHICH

00:33:02.347 --> 00:33:04.949
CAN PUT THE CHILD AT FURTHER

00:33:05.016 --> 00:33:07.719
RISK. ALL OF THESE REASONS WHY

00:33:07.785 --> 00:33:09.887
VACCINE DECISIONS SHOULD BE MADE

00:33:09.954 --> 00:33:13.324
BETWEEN PARENTS. CHILDREN AND A

00:33:13.391 --> 00:33:17.228
HEALTH CARE PROVIDER. THIS BILL

00:33:17.295 --> 00:33:19.664
IS ONE OF MANY THAT WE HAVE SEEN

00:33:19.731 --> 00:33:21.733
SEEKING TO REMOVE THE IMPORTANT

00:33:21.799 --> 00:33:28.606
ROLE OF. THANKS. AS A STRONG

BELIEVER IN THE POWER OF THE

00:33:30.808 --> 00:33:35.046
FAMILY UNIT. I URGE ALL OF US TO

00:33:35.113 --> 00:33:36.381
CONSIDER THE BROADER

00:33:36.447 --> 00:33:39.417
IMPLICATIONS OF THE DECISIONS WE

00:33:39.484 --> 00:33:42.487
MAKE HERE. AS WE ARE MAKING

00:33:42.553 --> 00:33:43.488
DECISIONS THAT EMPOWER HEALTHY

00:33:43.554 --> 00:33:45.690
FAMILIES TO MAKE THE DECISIONS

00:33:45.757 --> 00:33:47.191
THAT ARE BEST FOR THEIR FAMILIES

00:33:47.258 --> 00:33:50.828
OR WE ARE MANDATING FROM THE TOP

00:33:50.895 --> 00:33:54.732
DOWN WHAT WE THINK IS BEST. I'M

00:33:54.799 --> 00:33:56.667
GOING TO GO STRAIGHT RIGHT NOW

00:33:56.734 --> 00:33:58.503
AND I'M GOING OFF THE HEART

00:33:58.569 --> 00:34:06.677
RIGHT NOW. I'VE BEEN HERE ONLY.

00:34:06.744 --> 00:34:13.651
A YEAR AND A HALF. NOT VERY LONG. BUT I'VE SEEN AND I'VE BEEN

00:34:13.718 --> 00:34:16.120
LISTENING CAREFULLY TO WHAT MY

00:34:16.187 --> 00:34:17.221
COLLEAGUES HAVE BEEN STATING

00:34:17.288 --> 00:34:19.957

AND SOMETIMES WHAT MOTIVATES

00:34:23.928 --> 00:34:28.065
YOUR BILLS. SOMETIMES WE GET

MYOPIC WITH TICKET WE FOCUS ON

00:34:30.568 --> 00:34:32.303
ONE PARTICULAR BUILT ON THE

00:34:32.370 --> 00:34:34.338
MERITS OF THAT BILL. AND I CAN

00:34:34.405 --> 00:34:36.674
SEE THAT SOMETIMES WE VOTE

00:34:36.741 --> 00:34:38.476
BECAUSE IT SOUNDS WARM AND FUZZY

00:34:38.543 --> 00:34:40.178
IT'S SOMETHING THAT OKAY IT

00:34:40.244 --> 00:34:43.748
SOUNDS REALLY GOOD. BUT HERE'S

00:34:43.815 --> 00:34:47.952
THE THING COLLEAGUES. COMING

00:34:48.019 --> 00:34:50.254
FROM OUT THERE AND TO HEAR.

00:34:50.321 --> 00:34:51.856
SOMETIMES THE IMPLICATIONS OF

00:34:51.923 --> 00:34:54.559
THE BILLS THAT WE HAVE. HAVE AN

00:34:54.625 --> 00:34:56.894
IMPACT THAT DOESN'T COME RIGHT

AWAY BECOMES TEN TWENTY THIRTY

00:34:59.630 --> 00:35:02.066
FORTY YEARS FROM NOW. AND WHAT

00:35:02.133 --> 00:35:06.237
DO I MEAN BY THAT. I HEARD ONCE

00:35:06.304 --> 00:35:07.939
FOR ONE OF MY COLLEAGUES THAT WE

00:35:08.005 --> 00:35:11.709
CAN'T LEGISLATE VALUES. BUT LET

00:35:11.776 --> 00:35:13.611
ME REASSURE YOU THAT WHAT WE

00:35:13.678 --> 00:35:17.348
LEGISLATIVE BECOMES OUR VALUES

00:35:17.415 --> 00:35:19.517
OR A REFLECTION OF THE VALUES

00:35:19.584 --> 00:35:23.588
THAT SOME OF US HAVE. A VOTE

NO VOTE ON THIS BILL DOES NOT

00:35:33.865 --> 00:35:36.400
IMPLICATE THE FACT THAT WE DON'T

00:35:36.467 --> 00:35:44.742
BELIEVE IN VACCINATION. IT'S NOT

00:35:44.809 --> 00:35:46.577
A MATTER OF COST BECAUSE IT'S

00:35:46.644 --> 00:35:48.813
READILY ACCESSIBLE CALIFORNIA

00:35:48.880 --> 00:35:50.848
LEGISLATURE THE GOVERNOR HAS

00:35:50.915 --> 00:35:51.983
MADE IT POSSIBLE FOR THAT TO

00:35:52.049 --> 00:35:54.519
HAPPEN. FOR ANYONE TO HAVE THE

00:35:54.585 --> 00:35:58.222
CAPACITY TO MAKE THAT CHOICE.

00:35:58.289 --> 00:36:02.426
BUT A NO VOTE ON THIS BILL TODAY

00:36:02.493 --> 00:36:04.862
. BEANS THAT YOU BELIEVE THAT

00:36:04.929 --> 00:36:07.999
THE PARENT FUNDAMENTALLY OR THE

00:36:08.065 --> 00:36:10.034
CARE GIVER FUNDAMENTALLY. HAS

00:36:10.101 --> 00:36:11.068

THEIR FAMILY. WE ARE EMPOWERING

00:36:24.015 --> 00:36:27.018
FUNDAMENTAL UNIT OF ANY SOCIETY

00:36:27.084 --> 00:36:30.054

THE COUNTRY. WE KNOW THAT. BUT

00:36:42.099 --> 00:36:44.001
WE PASSED LEGISLATION WHAT WE

00:36:44.068 --> 00:36:46.237
TAKE AWAY THE PARENTS ABILITY TO

00:36:46.304 --> 00:36:48.539

CONVEY. THAT'S WHAT I KNOW BOARD

00:36:59.951 --> 00:37:01.752
OR A YES VOTE WOULD MEAN ON THIS

00:37:01.819 --> 00:37:03.888
. NOT THE FACT THAT THE VACCINES

00:37:03.955 --> 00:37:04.956
ARE NOT AVAILABLE BECAUSE THEY

00:37:05.022 --> 00:37:07.858
ARE. TO EVERYONE AND ANYONE WHO

00:37:07.925 --> 00:37:11.662
CHOOSES TO HELP THEM. THE OTHER

00:37:11.729 --> 00:37:14.098
THING I WANTED TO MENTION. IS

00:37:14.165 --> 00:37:17.301
THAT MOVING FORWARD. THE NOTION

00:37:17.368 --> 00:37:18.502
OF A PRECEDENCE BECAUSE WE'VE

00:37:18.569 --> 00:37:21.505
DONE IT BEFORE REFINERS COULD

00:37:21.572 --> 00:37:25.509
GET A VACCINE. DOZEN MAKES IT SO

00:37:25.576 --> 00:37:27.545
THAT THIS IS OKAY. THAT JUST

00:37:27.612 --> 00:37:29.313
MAKES IT THAT WERE FURTHERING

00:37:29.380 --> 00:37:30.915

RESPONSIBILITY AND ABILITY TO

00:37:34.852 --> 00:37:42.259
PAY. I HATE TO SAY THIS. BUT

00:37:42.326 --> 00:37:45.630
GOVERNMENT. CAN ONLY PROVIDE THE

00:37:45.696 --> 00:37:47.898
FRAMEWORK IN WHICH PEOPLE CAN

AND HAPPINESS. WHEN WE START

00:37:53.704 --> 00:37:56.741
OVER REACHING AND MANDATING. AND

00:37:56.807 --> 00:37:59.043
TELLING PEOPLE WHAT THEY CAN AND

00:37:59.110 --> 00:38:05.483

POINT WHERE WE SAY PARENTS ARE

00:38:14.025 --> 00:38:15.860
NO LONGER NECESSARY. JUST A

00:38:15.926 --> 00:38:17.628
COUPLE OF MONTHS AGO. THE

00:38:23.601 --> 00:38:27.405
BOTTOM ACROSS THE STATE. IN

00:38:27.471 --> 00:38:29.573
COMPARISON TO ACROSS THE STATE.

00:38:29.640 --> 00:38:30.508
AND YOU KNOW WHAT ONE OF THE

00:38:30.574 --> 00:38:32.843
SUGGESTIONS THAT THEY HAD ON

00:38:32.910 --> 00:38:33.844
THAT ARTICLE WHAT WOULD MAKE AN

00:38:33.911 --> 00:38:36.747
IMPACT IN A DIFFERENCE AND NOT.

SIGNIFICANT IMPACT IN OUR

ARRESTED THIS WEEK FOR KILLING

00:41:59.183 --> 00:42:02.419
HER CHILDREN. I WAS THINKING

00:42:02.486 --> 00:42:06.323
ABOUT PARENTS WHO ARE ANTI GAY

00:42:06.390 --> 00:42:09.093
WHO HAVE A CHILD WHO IS L. G. B.

00:42:09.159 --> 00:42:13.197
T. Q. I. A. AND HOW THEY PUNISH.

00:42:13.264 --> 00:42:16.567
THEM FOR BEING GAY REFUSE TO

00:42:16.634 --> 00:42:19.203
SHARE INFORMATION OR ACCESS TO

00:42:19.270 --> 00:42:21.405
RESOURCES OR SUPPORT OR TO

00:42:21.472 --> 00:42:25.109
ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THEY EXIST.

00:42:25.175 --> 00:42:27.311
NONE OF THAT HAS ANYTHING TO DO

00:42:27.378 --> 00:42:30.481
WITH VACCINES FOR SURE. BUT IT

00:42:30.547 --> 00:42:32.716
DOES ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THERE ARE

00:42:32.783 --> 00:42:38.155
ALL KINDS OF PARENTS. OUT THERE

00:42:38.222 --> 00:42:43.260
. AND SOME ARE AMAZING. ALL OF

00:42:43.327 --> 00:42:47.564
US FAIL. MANY OF US FAIL WITH

00:42:47.631 --> 00:42:52.169
REALLY GREAT INTENTIONS AT HEART

00:42:52.236 --> 00:42:54.438
. AND THERE ARE SOME THAT ARE

00:42:54.505 --> 00:42:57.841
NOT. LOOKING OUT FOR THE WELL

00:42:57.908 --> 00:43:01.645
BEING OF THE CHILDREN IN THEIR

00:43:01.712 --> 00:43:05.215
LIVES. I COMPLETELY AGREE

00:43:05.282 --> 00:43:07.584
PARENTAL RESPONSIBILITY AND

00:43:07.651 --> 00:43:10.354
LEGAL AUTHORITY. THERE SHOULD BE

00:43:10.421 --> 00:43:12.856
GREATER CONNECTIVITY BECAUSE I

00:43:12.923 --> 00:43:15.192
CAN TELL YOU SO MANY EXAMPLES OF

00:43:15.259 --> 00:43:17.161
WHY I FEEL LIKE HOW AM I

00:43:17.227 --> 00:43:18.829
RESPONSIBLE FOR ALL OF THIS AND

00:43:18.896 --> 00:43:21.031
THE CHALLENGES WANTS TO DO THE

00:43:21.098 --> 00:43:21.665
WHOLE THING BUT MAYBE I'M JUST

00:43:21.732 --> 00:43:24.601
CAUGHT UP IN THE MADNESS OF

00:43:24.668 --> 00:43:26.503
HAVING A TEENAGER AT HOME. BUT I

00:43:26.570 --> 00:43:27.438
DO THINK WE HAVE A

00:43:27.504 --> 00:43:29.406
RESPONSIBILITY TO LEGISLATE

00:43:29.473 --> 00:43:33.377
SAFETY. AND I THINK WE HAVE TO

00:43:33.444 --> 00:43:36.613
BE HONEST ABOUT ALL KINDS OF

00:43:36.680 --> 00:43:41.318
PARENTS. THAT ARE OUT HERE. AND

00:43:41.385 --> 00:43:45.589
SOME REALLY DO NEED LEGISLATIVE

00:43:45.656 --> 00:43:48.425
CIRCUMVENTION LIKE THIS I'LL

00:43:48.492 --> 00:43:50.294
REPHRASE THAT THE PARENTS MIGHT

00:43:50.361 --> 00:43:52.329
NOT NEED IT BUT THE CHILDREN

00:43:52.396 --> 00:43:54.531
DESERVE IT BECAUSE I WILL TELL

00:43:54.598 --> 00:43:58.469
YOU THIS YOUNG PEOPLE KNOW. WHEN

00:43:58.535 --> 00:44:00.237
THEY ARE IN TROUBLE THEY KNOW

00:44:00.304 --> 00:44:02.072
WHEN THEY ARE IN HARM'S WAY THEY

00:44:02.139 --> 00:44:04.041
KNOW THAT THEY ARE WITH A PARENT

00:44:04.108 --> 00:44:05.409
OR GUARDIAN THAT IS NOT LOVING

00:44:05.476 --> 00:44:10.347
THEM. AND THEY DON'T HAVE THE

00:44:10.414 --> 00:44:14.351
RESOURCES THAT WE- NO THEY

00:44:14.418 --> 00:44:16.587
SHOULD HAVE TO HELP THEM

00:44:16.653 --> 00:44:18.655
NAVIGATE THROUGH THEIR YOUNG

00:44:18.722 --> 00:44:24.261
LIFE SAFELY. AND WHEN IT COMES

00:44:24.328 --> 00:44:25.863
TO HAVING ACCESS TO MEDICINE

00:44:25.929 --> 00:44:28.465
THAT WILL KEEP YOU SAFE JUST

00:44:28.532 --> 00:44:31.368
LIKE IT WHEN IT COMES TO HAVING

00:44:31.435 --> 00:44:33.270
ACCESS TO RESOURCES THAT WILL

00:44:33.337 --> 00:44:36.440
KEEP YOU ALIVE THAT WILL PROTECT

00:44:36.507 --> 00:44:38.575
YOU WE HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY TO

00:44:38.642 --> 00:44:40.811
TALK ABOUT THOSE INSTANCES AND

00:44:40.878 --> 00:44:44.281
FIND A WAY TO CREATE POLICY THAT

00:44:44.348 --> 00:44:46.183
WILL HELP THOSE CHILDREN. SO I

00:44:46.250 --> 00:44:48.552
AM NOT THINKING ABOUT EIGHT SIX

00:44:48.619 --> 00:44:51.088
SIX IN THE CONTEXT OF MY FAMILY

00:44:51.155 --> 00:44:53.957
. BECAUSE WE DO HAVE SPACE AT

00:44:54.024 --> 00:44:56.126
THE TABLE FOR HONEST

00:44:56.193 --> 00:44:58.629
UNCOMFORTABLE OPEN DISCUSSIONS

00:44:58.695 --> 00:45:00.664
WHERE WE'RE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT

00:45:00.731 --> 00:45:02.800
HOW TO CREATE A PATH WHERE THE

00:45:02.866 --> 00:45:04.301
WHOLE FAMILY IS ON BOARD. I'M

00:45:04.368 --> 00:45:05.369
NOT THINKING ABOUT THOSE

00:45:05.436 --> 00:45:07.738
FAMILIES I'M THINKING ABOUT

00:45:07.805 --> 00:45:09.073
THOSE FAMILIES WHERE CHILDREN

00:45:09.139 --> 00:45:11.375
ARE AT RISK AND THE PARENT OR

00:45:11.442 --> 00:45:13.444
GUARDIAN THAT SHOULD BE LOOKING

00:45:13.510 --> 00:45:15.279
OUT FOR THEM IS NOT. IS

00:45:15.345 --> 00:45:19.750
INTENTIONALLY NOT. AND HOW DO WE

00:45:19.817 --> 00:45:23.220
HELP THEM. SO I RESPECTFULLY ASK

00:45:23.287 --> 00:45:25.189
YOUR AYE VOTE ON SB EIGHT SIX

00:45:25.255 --> 00:45:27.458

00:45:44.074 --> 00:45:45.876

00:46:02.926 --> 00:46:06.997
NOT ONE OF THOSE BILLS. WHEN YOU

00:46:07.064 --> 00:46:10.334
TALK ABOUT A TEENAGER. WHO IS

00:46:10.400 --> 00:46:12.503
EITHER BEING BLOCKED BY THEIR

00:46:12.569 --> 00:46:14.438
PARENT FROM PROTECTING THEIR

00:46:14.505 --> 00:46:17.341
HEALTH. OR IS BEING NEGLECTED OR

00:46:17.407 --> 00:46:19.643
ABUSED AND CAN PROTECT THEIR

00:46:19.710 --> 00:46:21.612
HEALTH. WHEN A TEENAGER IS

00:46:21.678 --> 00:46:25.249
SIMPLY SAYING. I HAVE I'M A

00:46:25.315 --> 00:46:26.216
TEENAGER WHO'S IMMUNO

00:46:26.283 --> 00:46:29.253
COMPROMISED AND DOESN'T WANT TO

00:46:29.319 --> 00:46:31.421
END UP ON A VENTILATOR. A

00:46:31.488 --> 00:46:34.158
TEENAGER WHO DOESN'T WANT TO GET

00:46:34.224 --> 00:46:36.927
THE MONTHS AND BECOME STERILE.

00:46:36.994 --> 00:46:38.095
PARENTS OFTEN BECOME STERILE THE

00:46:38.162 --> 00:46:39.730
KIDS GOING TO BE STERILE FOR THE

00:46:39.796 --> 00:46:42.966
REST OF THEIR LIVES. A KID WHO

00:46:43.033 --> 00:46:45.636
GOD FOR BID POLIO COMES BACK TO

00:46:45.702 --> 00:46:47.804
THIS COUNTRY BECAUSE AS I MET IT

00:46:47.871 --> 00:46:48.972
IS CIRCULATING IN THE WORLD. IF

00:46:49.039 --> 00:46:51.909
POLIO COMES BACK. WHO DOESN'T

00:46:51.975 --> 00:46:53.710
WANT TO BE PARA PARALYZED.

00:46:53.777 --> 00:46:55.512
BECAUSE THEIR PARENTS SPEND TOO

00:46:55.579 --> 00:46:58.582
MUCH TIME ON YOUTUBE OR FOX NEWS

00:46:58.649 --> 00:47:00.184
. AND IS PROVIDING THE KIDS ARE

00:47:00.250 --> 00:47:02.553
GETTING VACCINATED. IT'S ABOUT

00:47:02.619 --> 00:47:05.355
THOSE KIDS BEING ABLE TO PROTECT

00:47:05.422 --> 00:47:08.325
THEIR OWN HEALTH. WE'VE HEARD

00:47:08.392 --> 00:47:10.260
SOME PARADES OF HORRIBLE'S TODAY

00:47:10.327 --> 00:47:11.929
ABOUT FDA CLINICAL TRIALS WHICH

00:47:11.995 --> 00:47:13.997
ISN'T EVEN A QUESTION OF STATE

00:47:14.064 --> 00:47:15.732
LAW THAT FEDERAL LAW WE'VE HEARD

00:47:15.799 --> 00:47:18.368
ABOUT MACRO DATA SAID SIDE

00:47:18.435 --> 00:47:21.338
EFFECTS. BUT WE HAVE THAT OTHER

00:47:21.405 --> 00:47:23.006
PARADE OF HORRIBLE'S ABOUT KIDS

00:47:23.073 --> 00:47:25.209
ACTUALLY GETTING SICK AND DYING

00:47:25.275 --> 00:47:26.843
NOT SYSTEM CODED BUT OTHER

00:47:26.910 --> 00:47:30.280
DISEASES THAT ARE 1100% PER

00:47:30.347 --> 00:47:32.883
PERCENT PREVENTABLE. BUT FOR THE

00:47:32.950 --> 00:47:35.352
PARENT NOT ALLOWING THE KID TO

00:47:35.419 --> 00:47:37.521
PROTECT THEMSELVES. WE'VE HEARD

00:47:37.588 --> 00:47:39.590
ABOUT HEALTH HISTORY BUT NO KID

00:47:39.656 --> 00:47:41.425
KNOWS OUR HEALTH HISTORY A LOT

00:47:41.491 --> 00:47:42.559
OF KIDS DO KNOW THEIR HEALTH

00:47:42.626 --> 00:47:44.528
HISTORY AND THEY KNOW WHAT THE

00:47:44.595 --> 00:47:46.463
HELL'S THERE TAKING AND DOCTORS

00:47:46.530 --> 00:47:48.065
OR PHARMACISTS OR OTHER HEALH

CARE PROFESSIONALS THESE ARE

00:47:49.132 --> 00:47:50.100
PEOPLE WHO HAVE GONE THROUGH

00:47:50.167 --> 00:47:51.768
INTENSIVE TRAINING KNOWING WHAT

00:47:51.835 --> 00:47:53.203
QUESTIONS TO ASK WHAT WARNING

00:47:53.270 --> 00:47:55.205
SIGNS TO LOOK FOR. AND HOW TO

00:47:55.272 --> 00:47:57.407
MAKE DECISIONS ON WHO CAN GIVE

00:47:57.474 --> 00:47:59.109
INFORMED CONSENT. THESE ARE

00:47:59.176 --> 00:48:01.011
HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONALS. NOT

00:48:01.078 --> 00:48:06.116
JUST RANDOM PEOPLE. THANK HIGHS

I DISMISSED SAY OF COURSE WE

00:48:07.985 --> 00:48:10.320
WANT PARENTS TO BE INVOLVED IN

00:48:10.387 --> 00:48:11.388
THEIR KIDS HEALTH CARE.

00:48:11.455 --> 00:48:13.890
ABSOLUTELY WE WANT PARENTS TO BE

00:48:13.957 --> 00:48:16.360
INVOLVED. OF COURSE WE WANT KIDS

00:48:16.426 --> 00:48:18.428
TO FEEL COMFORTABLE TALKING TO

00:48:18.495 --> 00:48:20.163
THEIR PARENTS ABOUT VACCINATION-

00:48:20.230 --> 00:48:22.099
OR HUNDREDS OF OTHER IMPORTANT

00:48:22.165 --> 00:48:24.067
ISSUES IN LIFE WE ABSOLUTELY

00:48:24.134 --> 00:48:26.370
WANT THAT. BUT AS A SENATOR FROM

OF THE WORLD. FOR EVERY CHILD.

00:48:36.179 --> 00:48:37.347

00:48:37.414 --> 00:48:39.182
CHILDREN WHO CAN'T TALK TO THEIR

00:48:39.249 --> 00:48:41.818
PARENTS FOR WHATEVER REASON.

00:48:41.885 --> 00:48:42.886
WHERE THEY FEAR THAT THEY'RE

00:48:42.953 --> 00:48:45.055
GOING TO BE ABUSED AND THEY TALK

00:48:45.122 --> 00:48:47.057
TO THEIR PARENTS ABOUT IT.

00:48:47.124 --> 00:48:48.525
WHETHER PARENTS JUST WON'T

00:48:48.592 --> 00:48:51.561
LISTEN TO THEM. AND FOR THOSE

00:48:51.628 --> 00:48:53.997
