WILL PROVIDE THE STATE WITH

00:37:56.540 --> 00:37:58.009
ADDITIONAL INFORMATION.

00:37:58.075 --> 00:37:59.710
I CAN INFORM DISCUSSIONS ON HOW

00:37:59.777 --> 00:38:01.078
CALIFORNIA MIGHT REDUCE

00:38:01.145 --> 00:38:02.213
GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS EVEN

00:38:02.279 --> 00:38:03.280
FURTHER.

00:38:03.347 --> 00:38:05.249
AT THIS POINT WE NEED TO EXPLORE

00:38:05.316 --> 00:38:06.917
ALL OPPORTUNITIES.

00:38:06.984 --> 00:38:08.285
SO WE CAN UNDERSTAND BETTER HOW

00:38:08.352 --> 00:38:09.754
WE CAN ADDRESS CLIMATE CHANGE

00:38:09.820 --> 00:38:12.456
MOST EFFECTIVELY AND QUICKLY AND

00:38:12.523 --> 00:38:13.758
THE SHOULD INCLUDE EXAMINING THE

00:38:13.824 --> 00:38:15.426
SALES AND USE TAX IS A POTENTIAL

00:38:15.493 --> 00:38:16.460
MECHANISM.

REPORT YOU MAY BE FAMILIAR WITH

00:38:21.332 --> 00:38:22.299
THIS WHERE HIGHLIGHTS A GLOBAL

00:38:22.366 --> 00:38:23.768
URGENCY OF BECOMING CARBON

00:38:23.834 --> 00:38:25.903
NEUTRAL IF NOT CARBON NEGATIVE

00:38:25.970 --> 00:38:27.071
BY MID CENTURY.

00:38:27.138 --> 00:38:27.905
IN ORDER TO KEEP OVERALL

00:38:27.972 --> 00:38:29.407
TEMPERATURES FROM RISING NO MORE

00:38:29.473 --> 00:38:30.741
THAN ONE POINT FIVE DEGREES

00:38:30.808 --> 00:38:32.710
CELSIUS THIS IS COMPARED TO PRE

00:38:32.777 --> 00:38:34.078
INDUSTRIAL LEVELS.

00:38:34.145 --> 00:38:35.379

COMMITTED TO KEEP TEMPERATURE

00:38:39.316 --> 00:38:40.851
INCREASES TO WELL BELOW TWO

00:38:40.918 --> 00:38:41.786
DEGREES.

00:38:41.852 --> 00:38:42.787
CELSIUS TO AVOID THE MOST

00:38:42.853 --> 00:38:45.322
CATASTROPHIC IMPACTS OF CLIMATE

00:38:45.389 --> 00:38:46.123
CHANGE.

00:38:46.190 --> 00:38:47.792
CALIFORNIA IS A LEADER ON THE

00:38:47.858 --> 00:38:48.993
CLIMATE FRONT.

00:38:49.060 --> 00:38:50.861
WE ALSO NEED TO DO MORE IF YOU

AS AN OPPORTUNITY TO UNDERSTAND

00:38:59.970 --> 00:39:02.473
THE VIABILITY INEFFECTIVENESS OF

00:39:02.540 --> 00:39:03.774
ANOTHER TOOL.

00:39:03.841 --> 00:39:06.010
THIS TIME FOCUS ON CONSUMERS.

00:39:06.077 --> 00:39:06.844
THAT WAS A TO HELP US IN THIS

00:39:06.911 --> 00:39:08.646
EFFORT AND REDUCE GREENHOUSE GAS

00:39:08.713 --> 00:39:10.181
EMISSIONS IN CALIFORNIA AND

00:39:10.247 --> 00:39:11.449
POTENTIALLY OUTSIDE OF ITS

00:39:11.515 --> 00:39:12.383
BORDERS.

URGE YOUR SUPPORT FOR THIS BILL.

00:39:19.490 --> 00:39:21.058
SO WE CAN UNDERSTAND WHETHER

00:39:21.125 --> 00:39:23.060
CHANGE THE SALES AND USE TAX

00:39:23.127 --> 00:39:23.627
COULD ALSO BE A PART OF THE

00:39:23.694 --> 00:39:25.296
SOLUTION.

EXISTENTIAL THREAT.

00:39:57.094 --> 00:39:58.863
WE NEED A FAST DRAW DOWN IN A

00:39:58.929 --> 00:40:00.331
MULTI PRONGED APPROACH.

00:40:00.397 --> 00:40:01.398
IF WE'RE GOING TO GET TO A LOW

00:40:01.465 --> 00:40:02.600
CARBON ECONOMY ONE THAT THE

00:40:02.666 --> 00:40:03.601
THINGS WE NEED TO DO IS

00:40:03.667 --> 00:40:05.636
UNDERSTAND WHERE IN THE ECONOMY

00:40:05.703 --> 00:40:06.971
THE CARBON IS.

00:40:07.037 --> 00:40:08.706
AND THAT'S FOR CARBON INTENSITY

00:40:08.773 --> 00:40:10.274
TO TERMINATION COMES IN AND IF

AND ACCURATE.

00:40:14.845 --> 00:40:16.180
IT'S NOT NECESSARILY EASY TO DO

00:40:16.247 --> 00:40:17.715
TO DETERMINE THAT BUT THERE ARE

00:40:17.782 --> 00:40:19.083
MECHANISMS OUT THERE.

00:40:19.150 --> 00:40:21.318

FOR FUELS IN THE LOW CARBON FUEL

00:40:23.120 --> 00:40:24.021
STANDARD.

CARB STUDYING THE FEASIBILITY OF

00:40:25.756 --> 00:40:26.991
WHETHER WE COULD LOOK AT THE

00:40:27.057 --> 00:40:28.025
CARBON INTENSITY OF EVERYTHING

00:40:28.092 --> 00:40:29.560
IS SUBJECT TO THE SALES AND USE

00:40:29.627 --> 00:40:35.366

00:40:42.173 --> 00:40:43.307
IN CARBON AND ALSO WHAT'S

00:40:43.374 --> 00:40:45.376
BONDING IN CALIFORNIA TO BE LOW

00:40:45.442 --> 00:40:45.876
IN CARBON.

00:40:45.943 --> 00:40:47.278
IT IS A BROAD MESSAGE TO THE

OUR PLAN IT DEPENDS ON IT.

00:40:56.487 --> 00:40:58.122

STUDIES IN ARE PRECLUDED FROM

00:43:24.068 --> 00:43:26.370
DOING A CARBON TAX -- BUT WHAT

00:43:26.437 --> 00:43:28.038
WE ARE ASSERTING THAT WE DON'T

00:43:28.105 --> 00:43:30.040
NEED TO FORCE A CARBON TAX STUDY

00:43:30.107 --> 00:43:31.041
IF THEY'RE EQUALLY EFFECTIVE

00:43:31.108 --> 00:43:33.010
ALTERNATIVES TO ACHIEVE THE SAME

00:43:38.582 --> 00:43:39.283
CARBON EMISSIONS HERE IN

00:43:39.350 --> 00:43:41.352
CALIFORNIA WE HAVE BEEN AT THE

00:43:41.418 --> 00:43:42.920

AND GREENER PRODUCTION.

00:43:48.492 --> 00:43:49.827

OKAY SEEING NOBODY ELSE I'LL

00:44:03.040 --> 00:44:04.174
TAKE THE BILL NOW THE DISCUSSION

00:44:04.241 --> 00:44:04.775
TO THE DYESS IF THERE IS ANY

00:44:04.842 --> 00:44:06.944
COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS FROM.

00:44:07.011 --> 00:44:09.613
ANY COMMITTEE MEMBERS.

00:44:09.680 --> 00:44:10.514
AS A MEMBER OF THE PARTY THANK

00:44:10.581 --> 00:44:11.615
YOU AYE AYES I SUPPORT THIS

00:44:11.682 --> 00:44:14.184
MEASURE I I JUST HAVE A QUESTION

00:44:14.251 --> 00:44:15.452
FOR THE SENATOR SO.

00:44:15.519 --> 00:44:16.353
THE NOTION OF THIS IS A STUDY

00:44:16.420 --> 00:44:18.589
AND LOOKING AT THE CARBON TAX AS

00:44:18.655 --> 00:44:20.057
A POTENTIAL MODEL.

00:44:20.124 --> 00:44:23.093
YOU MENTIONED THAT IS TO BE

00:44:23.160 --> 00:44:24.128
REVENUE NEUTRAL.

00:44:24.194 --> 00:44:25.896
IT LOOKING AT THE CURRENT RATE

00:44:25.963 --> 00:44:27.364
FOR OUR SALES AND USE TAX I

00:44:27.431 --> 00:44:29.133
GUESS TWO THINGS.

00:44:29.199 --> 00:44:30.034
ONE IT'S REVENUE SHORT PERIOD OF

00:44:30.100 --> 00:44:32.636
TIME BUT AS THINGS CHANGE WITH

00:44:32.703 --> 00:44:34.071
THAT TECHNOLOGY.

00:44:34.138 --> 00:44:35.806
IT COULD FLUCTUATE AND HOW HOW

00:44:35.873 --> 00:44:37.441
THAT IMPACTS YOU KNOW EXISTING

00:44:37.508 --> 00:44:40.044
MONEY GOING. TO OUR STATE FOR

00:44:40.110 --> 00:44:43.047
SALES AND USE TAXES THAT PAY FOR

00:44:43.113 --> 00:44:45.516
SCHOOLS AND ROADS IN.

00:44:45.582 --> 00:44:47.151
PUBLIC SERVICES AND SO FORTH

00:44:47.217 --> 00:44:48.652
YEAH THE I MEAN THIS IS THAT IS

00:44:48.719 --> 00:44:49.953
ACTUALLY SOMETHING THAT THEY

00:44:50.020 --> 00:44:52.523
WOULD HAVE TO LOOK AT AS PART OF

00:44:52.589 --> 00:44:53.490
THE STUDY RIGHT IN THE THE ONE

00:44:53.557 --> 00:44:54.324
WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE

00:44:54.391 --> 00:44:56.794
WOULDN'T BE A ANY ANY DECREASE.

00:44:56.860 --> 00:44:59.129
TO PUBLIC REVENUES BOB WHAT WE

00:44:59.196 --> 00:45:01.231
DO WHEN WE CALL IT NEVER USUALLY

00:45:01.298 --> 00:45:01.865
TWENTY MAKE SURE THAT THIS IT'S

00:45:01.932 --> 00:45:02.599
CLEAR THAT WE'RE NOT.

00:45:02.666 --> 00:45:03.667
WE'RE NOT USING THIS AS AN

00:45:03.734 --> 00:45:05.135
OPPORTUNITY TO RAISE TAXES ON

00:45:05.202 --> 00:45:07.004
THAT ON THE POPULATION -- BUT

00:45:07.071 --> 00:45:08.172
BUT THAT WOULD THAT'S IT THAT'S

00:45:08.238 --> 00:45:10.207
SOMETHING WE LOOK AT AND AND THE

00:45:10.274 --> 00:45:11.508
YEAH THAT THE FOLKS SETTING IS

00:45:11.575 --> 00:45:13.043
PART OF THAT THE STUDY.

00:45:13.110 --> 00:45:14.912
WOULD HAVE TO TO MAKE SURE THAT

00:45:14.978 --> 00:45:16.113
THERE WOULDN'T BE ANY NET LOSS

00:45:16.180 --> 00:45:19.850
IN PUBLIC REVENUES SO IF IT IS

00:45:19.917 --> 00:45:20.717
REVENUE NEUTRAL AND THERE'S NO

00:45:20.784 --> 00:45:21.018
[inaudible]

00:45:21.085 --> 00:45:22.186
INCREASED.

00:45:22.252 --> 00:45:22.853
TO PAY FOR ENVIRONMENTAL

00:45:22.920 --> 00:45:23.487
PROGRAMS LIKE WE DO WITH CAP AND

00:45:23.554 --> 00:45:24.822
TRADE.

00:45:24.888 --> 00:45:28.992
OR TO CHANGE BEHAVIOR THEN HOW

00:45:29.059 --> 00:45:31.228
DOES THAT IMPACT.

00:45:31.295 --> 00:45:32.129
THE ENTITIES OUT THERE WHO

00:45:32.196 --> 00:45:34.031
YOU'RE SEEKING TO TO MAKE A

00:45:34.098 --> 00:45:34.998
CHANGE.

00:45:35.065 --> 00:45:37.000
THERE COULD BE -- THEN WHEN ONE

00:45:37.067 --> 00:45:39.570
POSSIBILITY WOULD BE -- KIND OF

00:45:39.636 --> 00:45:40.437
A MECHANISM WHERE YOU WOULD

00:45:40.504 --> 00:45:42.406
TWEAK IT OVER TIME WHERE YOU

00:45:42.473 --> 00:45:45.142
COULD INCREASE -- THE TAX TO A

00:45:45.209 --> 00:45:46.176
CERTAIN PRODUCT IF THERE WAS IT

00:45:46.243 --> 00:45:46.944
IF THERE WAS A YOU KNOW A

00:45:47.010 --> 00:45:48.278
DECREASE TO PUBLIC REVENUE

00:45:48.345 --> 00:45:50.514
ASSOCIATED WITH -- YOU KNOW WITH

00:45:50.581 --> 00:45:51.949
WITH THE CHANGE SO THAT WOULD BE

00:45:52.015 --> 00:45:53.317
ONE WAY BUT YOU HAVE TO CREATE

00:45:53.383 --> 00:45:54.651
SOME SORT OF MECHANISM TO MAKE

00:45:54.718 --> 00:45:55.519
SURE THERE WASN'T A LOT BUT IT'S

00:45:55.586 --> 00:45:57.521
IDEA TO HAVE A PRODUCT CHANGE

00:45:57.588 --> 00:46:01.425
ITS STRUCTURE ITS IMPACT IS THAT.

00:46:01.492 --> 00:46:03.460
IS THAT KIND OF WHAT THE GOAL IS

00:46:03.527 --> 00:46:04.094
LIKE WE I THINK THE GOAL LIKE

00:46:04.161 --> 00:46:05.963
WITH CAP AND TRADE IS.

00:46:06.029 --> 00:46:08.866
TO IS TO LOOK AT THE POSSIBILITY

00:46:08.932 --> 00:46:09.533
OF WHAT.

00:46:09.600 --> 00:46:11.635
OF OF MAKING SURE THAT -- THAT

00:46:11.702 --> 00:46:13.370
THAT WE DO A BETTER JOB OF

00:46:13.437 --> 00:46:14.838
BUILDING IN THE THE TRUE COSTS

00:46:14.905 --> 00:46:16.440
ASSOCIATED WITH.

00:46:16.507 --> 00:46:20.244
CERTAIN TYPES OF PRODUCTS -- AND

00:46:20.310 --> 00:46:22.379
IT OVER TIME WE COULD YOU KNOW

00:46:22.446 --> 00:46:23.947
AYE AYES BEHAVIORS SHIFT.

00:46:24.014 --> 00:46:25.516
WE WOULD HAVE.

00:46:25.582 --> 00:46:27.017
TO AS YOU SEE WHAT HAPPENED

00:46:27.084 --> 00:46:27.584
TRADE RIGHT IN THAT THEY DID

00:46:27.651 --> 00:46:28.819
THEY GETS.

00:46:28.886 --> 00:46:29.720
YOU KNOW WE WE WE WE GET UP THE

00:46:29.786 --> 00:46:30.587
INTO WE KEPT THE COSTS

00:46:30.654 --> 00:46:32.322
ASSOCIATED WITH THAT OF THE

00:46:32.389 --> 00:46:35.859
PRODUCT -- BUT YOU WITH THE BILL

00:46:35.926 --> 00:46:37.794
THESE IS OPEN ENDED SO AS TO

00:46:37.861 --> 00:46:39.296
ALLOW FOR SOME.

00:46:39.363 --> 00:46:41.298
TAX EXPERTS TO REALLY SPEND SOME

00:46:41.365 --> 00:46:42.533
TIME DIGGING INTO THE

00:46:42.599 --> 00:46:44.201
POSSIBILITIES AND COME UP WITH A

00:46:44.268 --> 00:46:46.503
MECHANISM THAT -- THAT THEY THAT

00:46:46.570 --> 00:46:48.238
THEY THINK WOULD BE FAIR AND AND

00:46:48.305 --> 00:46:49.106
THAT WOULD ADDRESS.

00:46:49.173 --> 00:46:50.974
THIS ISSUE OVER OF POTENTIAL

00:46:51.041 --> 00:46:52.643
REVENUE LOSS.

00:46:52.709 --> 00:46:53.977
AND BEHAVIORAL CHANGE.

00:46:54.044 --> 00:46:55.179
SO WHAT WE WE DON'T WE ARE WE'RE

00:46:55.245 --> 00:46:56.880
NOT DELINEATING A PARTICULAR

00:46:56.947 --> 00:46:58.982
PATH HERE -- BUT WERE CONVENING

00:46:59.049 --> 00:47:00.784
EXPERTS.

00:47:00.851 --> 00:47:03.220
TO YOU KNOW.

00:47:03.287 --> 00:47:03.854
TO TO YOU KNOW TO TO TO TO LOOK

00:47:03.921 --> 00:47:07.424
AT I HAVE A WHAT YOU KNOW IT IT

00:47:07.491 --> 00:47:08.825
IT IT IT BUT BURKE WHICH TO WEAR

00:47:08.892 --> 00:47:10.060
DIFFERENT POSSIBILITIES ME ME ME

00:47:10.127 --> 00:47:11.395
LEAD US.

00:47:11.461 --> 00:47:12.930
I'M NOT TRYING TO BE.

00:47:12.996 --> 00:47:13.797
NO BIG HERE BUT WE WE REALLY DO

00:47:13.864 --> 00:47:15.232
WANT TO LEAVE IT OPEN ENDED SO

00:47:15.299 --> 00:47:16.667
THAT EXPERTS CAN SPEND SOME TIME

00:47:16.733 --> 00:47:18.135
REALLY GRAPPLING WITH.

00:47:18.202 --> 00:47:20.170
WITH THESE THINGS OKAY NOT WHAT

00:47:20.237 --> 00:47:20.837
WE NOW I WILL SAY.

00:47:20.904 --> 00:47:23.340
THE BECAUSE OF THE CHANGES THAT

00:47:23.407 --> 00:47:24.942
ARE MADE AND IT WILL.

00:47:25.008 --> 00:47:25.542
WHAT WE'RE REALLY NOT FOCUSING

00:47:25.609 --> 00:47:26.910
ON TRYING TO SEE IF THERE'S SOME

00:47:26.977 --> 00:47:30.781
WAY? TO TO ASSESS THE CARBON

00:47:30.847 --> 00:47:33.050
INTENSITY IN A PRODUCT THAT'S

00:47:33.116 --> 00:47:33.917
REALLY WHAT WE'VE GONE WITH OUR

00:47:33.984 --> 00:47:37.754
DISCUSSIONS -- SO WE'RE WE'RE

00:47:37.821 --> 00:47:39.856
WE'VE WE'VE MOVED TO WET MY MY

00:47:39.923 --> 00:47:41.091
ORIGINAL VISION WAS THIS.

00:47:41.158 --> 00:47:42.326
KIND OF THOUGHT WHAT IF WE WERE

00:47:42.392 --> 00:47:44.494
JUST LITERALLY REPLACE THE THE

00:47:44.561 --> 00:47:45.529
SALES AND USE TAX TO THE REVENUE

00:47:45.596 --> 00:47:46.697
NEUTRAL CARBON TAX.

00:47:46.763 --> 00:47:48.532
ON THIS COULD HELP US MOVE IN

00:47:48.599 --> 00:47:50.067
THAT DIRECTION BUT WHERE THE

00:47:50.133 --> 00:47:51.435
BILL IS NOW WITH THE AMENDMENTS

00:47:51.501 --> 00:47:52.936
AND I REALLY DO APPRECIATE THE

00:47:53.003 --> 00:47:54.638
WORK WE'VE DONE WITH OPPOSITION --

00:47:54.705 --> 00:47:55.973
WE'RE NOW IN A PLACE WHERE WHERE

00:47:56.039 --> 00:47:57.040
WHERE WORLD JUST LASKIN REALLY

00:47:57.107 --> 00:47:58.976
LOOKING AT HOW WE MIGHT GO ABOUT

00:47:59.042 --> 00:48:00.677
PRICING CARBON INTENSITY

00:48:00.744 --> 00:48:01.211
ASSOCIATED WITH CONSUMER

00:48:01.278 --> 00:48:02.479
PRODUCTS.

00:48:02.546 --> 00:48:04.114
AND SO.

00:48:04.181 --> 00:48:05.816
IT'S ALL THE QUESTIONS YOU'RE

00:48:05.882 --> 00:48:07.217
ASKING ARE ARE OBSOLETE ON POINT

00:48:07.284 --> 00:48:08.885
THERE IS A LITTLE PREMATURE

00:48:08.952 --> 00:48:11.555
GIVEN WHERE THE BILL IS IN GIVEN --%

00:48:11.622 --> 00:48:12.656
CAM HOW IT'S MOVING RIGHT NOW

00:48:12.723 --> 00:48:15.626
BUT I I THINK THAT THE

00:48:15.692 --> 00:48:16.226
DISCUSSION WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO

00:48:16.293 --> 00:48:17.160
HAVE.

00:48:17.227 --> 00:48:18.395
IF WE DECIDE THAT THERE REALLY

00:48:18.462 --> 00:48:19.429
IS A A MECHANISM FOR FOR

00:48:19.496 --> 00:48:20.197
PROPERLY PRICING CARBON

00:48:20.264 --> 00:48:21.431
INTENSITY IF WE WANT TO ADOPT

00:48:21.498 --> 00:48:22.633
THIS MODEL.

00:48:22.699 --> 00:48:23.700
HAS A STATE ON THE LINE.

00:48:23.767 --> 00:48:25.769
OKAY.

00:48:25.836 --> 00:48:27.070
THANK YOU THANK YOU

00:48:27.137 --> 00:48:29.439
ASSEMBLYMEMBER EGGMAN.

00:48:29.506 --> 00:48:32.909
THANK YOU THANK YOU CENTER ON I

00:48:32.976 --> 00:48:34.044
HAVE SOME QUESTIONS LONG LINE OF

00:48:34.111 --> 00:48:35.912
OF THAT SO MEMBER MCCARTY JUST

00:48:35.979 --> 00:48:38.081
IN.

00:48:38.148 --> 00:48:39.116
JUST AND LIKE YOU KNOW IS THE

00:48:39.182 --> 00:48:40.917
GRAND SCHEME TO PUT IT HARD TO

00:48:40.984 --> 00:48:42.185
CAP AND TRADE IS IT WOULD BE A

00:48:42.252 --> 00:48:45.255
WHOLE SEPARATE SYSTEM DO WE KNOW --

00:48:45.322 --> 00:48:48.191
AND THEN I GUESS THE THE IDEA OF

00:48:48.258 --> 00:48:50.294
MARKET BASED SYSTEMS LIKE THAT I

00:48:50.360 --> 00:48:51.061
MEAN.

00:48:51.128 --> 00:48:52.362
I DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH DECREASED

00:48:52.429 --> 00:48:54.164
WE'VE SEEN WE'RE CHARGING PEOPLE

00:48:54.231 --> 00:48:56.199
TO TO POLLUTE BUT THAT DOESN'T

00:48:56.266 --> 00:48:57.267
ALWAYS CHANGE BEHAVIOR.

00:48:57.334 --> 00:48:59.736
IF YOU CAN AFFORD THE PRICE OF A

00:48:59.803 --> 00:49:02.005
POLLUTION -- BUT I GUESS MY

00:49:02.072 --> 00:49:05.175
QUESTION LIKE TO ASK THE DATE IS --

00:49:05.242 --> 00:49:06.977
WHAT CERTAIN TYPES OF PRODUCTS

00:49:07.044 --> 00:49:08.845
IT WAS IT HOW EXPENSIVE ARE THE

00:49:08.912 --> 00:49:09.479
TYPES OF PRODUCTS THAT YOU CAN

00:49:09.546 --> 00:49:11.815
BE -- UNDER CONSIDERATION IN

00:49:11.882 --> 00:49:13.283
THIS OR IS AT ALL IS THAT ALL

00:49:13.350 --> 00:49:18.322
LEFT TO TO THE AGENCY DECIDE.

00:49:18.388 --> 00:49:19.690
ARE.

00:49:19.756 --> 00:49:20.991
LARGELY IT'S IT'S LESS EASY TO

00:49:21.058 --> 00:49:23.660
SIDE AND WHERE WE ARE -- AND

00:49:23.727 --> 00:49:24.528
WE'RE WE'RE WE'RE KEEPING AN

00:49:24.594 --> 00:49:25.195
OPEN AND ON PURPOSE FOR THAT FOR

YOU BECAUSE WE WANT TO GIVE THEM

00:49:25.929 --> 00:49:29.700
THE FLEXIBILITY -- YOU KNOW. TO

00:49:29.766 --> 00:49:32.202
TO TO BE ABLE.

00:49:32.269 --> 00:49:33.837
TO TO YES TO TO DO THIS WORK

00:49:33.904 --> 00:49:35.205
RIGHT AT ME THE OTHER DAY -- THE

00:49:35.272 --> 00:49:36.239
THE ECONOMY WILL CHANGE PRODUCTS

00:49:36.306 --> 00:49:37.908
WILL CHANGE THINGS CONTINUE TO

00:49:37.974 --> 00:49:40.711
EVOLVE -- WE WE WE WANTED TO

PROVIDE FLEXIBILITY TO THEM.

00:49:44.381 --> 00:49:46.216
IS IT JUST JUST THINGS THAT ARE

00:49:46.283 --> 00:49:47.551
PROCESS BECAUSE WE'RE NOT

00:49:47.617 --> 00:49:49.386
TALKING OF FOOD ITEMS MIGHT BE

00:49:49.453 --> 00:49:51.254

AYE BUT I GUESS -- IN THE END OF

00:50:04.901 --> 00:50:05.902
THE DAY I KNOW THAT THIS IS A

00:50:05.969 --> 00:50:06.503
POTENTIALLY VERY COMPLICATED

00:50:06.570 --> 00:50:07.904
THING AND WHAT I'VE SAID OVER

00:50:07.971 --> 00:50:09.106
AND OVER AGAIN ON THE SENATE

00:50:09.172 --> 00:50:09.873
SIDE.

00:50:09.940 --> 00:50:10.507
MY AS A BILL IS MOVING THROUGH

00:50:10.574 --> 00:50:12.109
IS IT IT MAY VERY WELL BE THAT

00:50:12.175 --> 00:50:13.877
WE LOVE THE CONCEPT OF DOING

00:50:13.944 --> 00:50:15.112
THIS IT ON THE LINE.

00:50:15.178 --> 00:50:16.580
BUT THAT THE FEASIBILITY IS JUST

00:50:16.646 --> 00:50:17.748
SO OUT OF CONTROL THAT SO

00:50:17.814 --> 00:50:19.649
DIFFICULT TO PROPERLY PRICE

00:50:19.716 --> 00:50:20.817
THESE THINGS THAT JUST FROM A

00:50:20.884 --> 00:50:22.786
PRACTICALITY PERSPECTIVE IT IS

00:50:22.853 --> 00:50:24.855
NOT WORTH DOING.

00:50:24.921 --> 00:50:25.455
I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT

00:50:25.522 --> 00:50:27.224
THEY WERE YEAH WE'RE CONSIDERING

00:50:27.290 --> 00:50:27.991
THE IDEA WE'RE LOOKING INTO A

00:50:28.058 --> 00:50:29.326
LITTLE BIT.

00:50:29.393 --> 00:50:30.861
AND IF IF IT BUT IT BUT YOU DO

00:50:30.927 --> 00:50:31.962
UFC RIGHT I MEAN THESE ISSUES

00:50:32.028 --> 00:50:33.830
HAVE COME UP AS WE AS WE'VE BEEN

00:50:33.897 --> 00:50:35.866
MOVING ALONG AND THEY MAY PROVE

00:50:35.932 --> 00:50:36.500
THIS WAY TOO DIFFICULT THE JUST

00:50:36.566 --> 00:50:37.100
THE A MAY BE A GREAT IDEA BUT

00:50:37.167 --> 00:50:38.235
DOES NOT A GOOD THING. TO DO

00:50:38.301 --> 00:50:39.603
FROM A FROM OF IMPLEMENTATION

00:50:39.669 --> 00:50:41.571
PERSPECTIVE.

00:50:41.638 --> 00:50:43.373
AND IF THAT'S THE CASE I SILLY

00:50:43.440 --> 00:50:44.174
WHEN NOT IN USE IN PURSUING IT

00:50:44.241 --> 00:50:45.509
ANY FURTHER BUT I DO WANT TO

00:50:45.575 --> 00:50:46.510
GIVE IT A LOOK I THINK.

00:50:46.576 --> 00:50:47.844
WE OUGHT TO GET SOME EXPERTS TO

00:50:47.911 --> 00:50:49.246
REALLY SPEND SOME TIME LOOKING

00:50:49.312 --> 00:50:51.248
AT THIS BECAUSE RIGHT NOW -- BUT

00:50:51.314 --> 00:50:53.850
WE KNOW WE WE HAVE ENORMOUS

00:50:53.917 --> 00:50:55.018
PROBLEMS AFTER DRESSERS AND YOU

00:50:55.085 --> 00:50:55.519
THE CAPITATE SYSTEM IS.

00:50:55.585 --> 00:51:02.526
MUCH SMALLER THAN THE SALES TAX.

00:51:02.592 --> 00:51:02.759
SYSTEM.

00:51:02.826 --> 00:51:03.293
NOW WE CAN REALLY MAKE A

00:51:03.360 --> 00:51:03.860
DIFFERENCE HERE IF WE DO IT

00:51:03.927 --> 00:51:06.663
RIGHT BUT IF IT PROVES THAT THAT

00:51:06.730 --> 00:51:07.931
IS JUST THE INVISIBLE IT'S NOT

00:51:07.998 --> 00:51:08.298
WORTH PURSUING.

00:51:08.365 --> 00:51:08.932
IT IS THE CONCEPT THEN THAT IT

00:51:08.999 --> 00:51:11.435
WOULD REPLACE SALES TAX.

00:51:11.501 --> 00:51:12.436
THAT WAS THE ORIGINAL IDEA YES

00:51:12.502 --> 00:51:14.171
THAT'S IDEA. TO REPLACE IT AND

00:51:14.237 --> 00:51:14.738
IF YOU DO YOU DO YOU DO YOU

00:51:14.805 --> 00:51:15.872
REPLACE IT WITH THE WITH THE

00:51:15.939 --> 00:51:19.276
REVENUE NEUTRAL -- PRICING TAX

00:51:19.342 --> 00:51:20.744
BASED ON CARBON INTENSITY BUT AS

00:51:20.811 --> 00:51:23.313
I SAY RIGHT NOW IT'S ONLY.

00:51:23.380 --> 00:51:24.748
ALL WE'RE DOING NOW IS IS

00:51:24.815 --> 00:51:26.817
GETTING THEM TO LOOK AT CARBON A

00:51:26.883 --> 00:51:27.350
DUNE ASSESSMENT OF CARBON

00:51:27.417 --> 00:51:27.818
INTENSITY.

00:51:27.884 --> 00:51:32.088
AND IT WOULD BE THE FIRST STEP

00:51:32.155 --> 00:51:35.158
TOWARD TOWARD YUP TOWARD MOVING

00:51:35.225 --> 00:51:36.960
TOWARDS AND I GUESS IT IS

00:51:37.027 --> 00:51:37.561
SOMETHING WE REALLY TO SAY WE

00:51:37.627 --> 00:51:39.062
WANT TO DO.

00:51:39.129 --> 00:51:40.597
IT THEN TOOK THEN IF I CAN JUST

00:51:40.664 --> 00:51:41.131
ASK BECAUSE WE'RE THERE'S

00:51:41.198 --> 00:51:41.665
THERE'S ALSO BEEN ONGOING

00:51:41.731 --> 00:51:42.999
CONVERSATIONS ABOUT MOVING FROM

00:51:43.066 --> 00:51:44.301
A SALES TAX MODEL TO A SERVICE

00:51:44.367 --> 00:51:45.802
TAX MODEL BECAUSE SO MUCH MORE

00:51:45.869 --> 00:51:47.671
OF OUR ECONOMY IS BASED ON THE

00:51:47.737 --> 00:51:49.139
SERVICE INDUSTRY NOW.

00:51:49.206 --> 00:51:51.908
SO WITH THAT ALSO THEN APPLIED.

00:51:51.975 --> 00:51:54.411
TO SERVICES RENDERED.

00:51:54.478 --> 00:51:55.545
WE'RE LOOK THIS IS THIS IS THIS

00:51:55.612 --> 00:51:56.980
IS THIS IS -- RESPONSE TO THE

00:51:57.047 --> 00:51:59.216
CURRENT SALES TAX SYSTEM SO WE

00:51:59.282 --> 00:52:00.217
WOULD HAVE TO CROSS THAT BRIDGE

00:52:00.283 --> 00:52:01.718
WHEN WE GOT THERE IF THAT WAS

00:52:01.785 --> 00:52:02.619
WHERE THE LEGISLATURE WAS WAS

00:52:02.686 --> 00:52:03.019
GOING.

00:52:03.086 --> 00:52:04.988
AS I AY ALL WE'REDOING WITH

00:52:05.055 --> 00:52:06.556
THIS IS IS STUDYING AN

00:52:06.623 --> 00:52:08.758
ASSESSMENT -- A COULD YOU

00:52:08.825 --> 00:52:09.726
WHATEVER DATA COMES OUT OF THAT

00:52:09.793 --> 00:52:10.327
ASSESSMENT COULD THEN BE FIT

00:52:10.393 --> 00:52:13.196
INTO WHATEVER PLAN WE HAVE WITH

00:52:13.263 --> 00:52:15.265
REGARDS TO MOVING FORWARD WITH A

00:52:15.332 --> 00:52:18.068
SALES OR SERVICES TAX SYSTEM

00:52:25.575 --> 00:52:28.678
A BIG BOLD IDEA BUT WE HAVE A

00:52:28.745 --> 00:52:30.213
MAJOR CRISIS AND SO.

00:52:30.280 --> 00:52:31.314
I WOULD WANT TO TAKE ANY BIG

00:52:31.381 --> 00:52:32.883

FORTY NINE WOULD OPEN THE DOOR

00:54:33.403 --> 00:54:36.106
FOR OUR FOR ALL OF US TO BE ABLE

00:54:36.172 --> 00:54:37.841
TO UTILIZE TECHNOLOGICAL

00:54:37.907 --> 00:54:39.776
INNOVATIONS WHICH MANY OF US

00:54:39.843 --> 00:54:41.611
HAVE RIGHT ON OUR PHONE OR ON

00:54:41.678 --> 00:54:43.747
OUR SMART METER AT HOME OR ON

00:54:43.813 --> 00:54:46.583
THE THERMOSTAT IN OUR HOUSE.

00:54:46.650 --> 00:54:48.818
OR ANY NUMBER OF OTHER THINGS --

00:54:48.885 --> 00:54:51.721
SO WE NOTE NOW THAT THERE'S LOTS

00:54:51.788 --> 00:54:53.823
OF APPLIANCES ON THE MARKET THAT

00:54:53.890 --> 00:54:55.458
ARE CALLED SMART APPLIANCES THAT

00:54:55.525 --> 00:54:57.027
ALLOW YOU TO BE HOOKED UP ON

00:54:57.093 --> 00:54:59.329
YOUR PHONE. TO BE ABLE TO TURN

00:54:59.396 --> 00:55:01.431

ABLE TO CHANGE SETTINGS ALL OF

00:55:03.266 --> 00:55:04.267
THAT.

00:55:04.334 --> 00:55:05.735
BUT RIGHT NOW.

00:55:05.802 --> 00:55:08.938
WE BECAUSE OF THE STATUTE

00:55:09.005 --> 00:55:10.874
EXISTING STATUTE FOR THE ENERGY

00:55:10.940 --> 00:55:12.976
COMMISSION IT ENABLES ENERGY

00:55:13.043 --> 00:55:14.878
COMMISSION ONLY TO SET APPOINT

00:55:14.944 --> 00:55:18.148
STANDARDS FOR ENERGY EFFICIENCY.

00:55:18.214 --> 00:55:19.883
AND THE ENERGY EFFICIENCY IS

00:55:19.949 --> 00:55:21.918
RESTRICTED TO THAT WHICH IS COST

00:55:21.985 --> 00:55:23.720
EFFECTIVE IN THE COST EFFECTIVE

00:55:23.787 --> 00:55:25.622
IS A NARROW DEFINITION.

00:55:25.689 --> 00:55:26.923
AND THE CREW IT MUST BE ONLY

00:55:26.990 --> 00:55:28.892
THOSE THINGS THAT DIRECTLY

00:55:28.958 --> 00:55:31.127
REDUCE THE INDIVIDUAL RATE

00:55:31.194 --> 00:55:32.796
PAYERS COST.

00:55:32.862 --> 00:55:36.633
NOW WE KNOW THAT WITH AS WE ARE

00:55:36.700 --> 00:55:38.201
EMBARKING ON GETTING MORE AND

00:55:38.268 --> 00:55:39.069
MORE RENEWABLE ENERGY IN OUR

00:55:39.135 --> 00:55:43.473
CURRENT GRID 50% AND THEN A 100%.

00:55:43.540 --> 00:55:44.841
IT IS VERY OPTIMAL FOR US TO BE

00:55:44.908 --> 00:55:46.476
ABLE TO USE THAT RENEWABLE

00:55:46.543 --> 00:55:49.779
ENERGY WHEN IT IS GENERATED AND

00:55:49.846 --> 00:55:51.081
RENEWABLE ENERGY IS NOT

00:55:51.147 --> 00:55:53.950
NECESSARILY GENERATED.

00:55:54.017 --> 00:55:54.884
TWENTY FOUR SEVEN SO IF WE CAN

00:55:54.951 --> 00:55:58.288
MANAGE OUR DEMANDS WHICH THESE.

00:55:58.354 --> 00:55:59.456
APPLICATIONS AND SMART

00:55:59.522 --> 00:56:02.992
APPLIANCES WOULD ALLOW US. TO TO

00:56:03.059 --> 00:56:06.129
UTILIZE THAT ENERGY MAXIMIZE IT

00:56:06.196 --> 00:56:07.664
WHEN IT'S BEING GENERATED.

00:56:07.731 --> 00:56:10.066
WE WILL GET FAR MORE BANG FOR

00:56:10.133 --> 00:56:12.469
OUR BACK WE WILL HAVE PERHAPS

00:56:12.535 --> 00:56:14.337
NEED.

00:56:14.404 --> 00:56:16.172
TO BUILD LESS POWER PLANTS EVEN

00:56:16.239 --> 00:56:18.508
RENEWABLE ONCE AND FOR SURE WE

00:56:18.575 --> 00:56:21.678
WOULD REDUCE OUR RELIANCE ON HER

00:56:21.745 --> 00:56:24.781
PLANTS WHICH ARE STILL PRIMARILY.

00:56:24.848 --> 00:56:28.284
POWERED BY NATURAL GAS SO

00:56:28.351 --> 00:56:30.520
BASICALLY SB FORTY NINE WOULD

00:56:30.587 --> 00:56:32.756
JUST ALLOW THE ENERGY COMMISSION

00:56:32.822 --> 00:56:34.758
TO BE ABLE TO SET STANDARDS SO

00:56:34.824 --> 00:56:36.159
THE FIRST SMART APPLIANCES

ONE HUNDRED GOALS.

00:57:15.098 --> 00:57:17.534
IT'S EXTREMELY IMPORTANT TO

00:57:17.600 --> 00:57:18.535
ENSURE THAT THE DEMAND OF

00:57:18.601 --> 00:57:20.069
ELECTRICITY MATCHES WHEN NOT

00:57:20.136 --> 00:57:22.172
SUPPLY IS CLEAN AND

00:57:22.238 --> 00:57:25.708
PREDOMINATELY GENERATED BY

SHEREEN WHEN THERE'S HIGH

00:57:41.558 --> 00:57:42.692
PROPORTION OF RENEWABLES BUT IT

00:57:42.759 --> 00:57:44.594
ALSO SHARES WHEN PRICES ARE LOW

00:57:44.661 --> 00:57:46.763
SO THAT CONSUMERS ARE USING

00:57:46.830 --> 00:57:49.499
ELECTRICITY WHEN IT'S CHEAP BEST.

00:57:49.566 --> 00:57:50.433
WHERE OWN CONNECT IS MOST

00:57:50.500 --> 00:57:52.068

TRANSITION.

00:57:59.976 --> 00:58:02.645
OUR HOMES WITH THE SMART DEVICES

00:58:17.827 --> 00:58:18.561

00:58:18.628 --> 00:58:19.829
CALIFORNIA HAS AN ABUNDANCE OF

00:58:19.896 --> 00:58:21.164
ENERGY THE QUESTION IS REALLY

00:58:21.231 --> 00:58:22.332
AND HOW THAT ENERGY EBBS AND

00:58:22.398 --> 00:58:23.867
FLOWS THROUGHOUT THE DAY.

00:58:23.933 --> 00:58:25.235
SO BASICALLY WHAT THIS BILL DOES

00:58:25.301 --> 00:58:26.803
IS OBVIOUSLY MAXIMIZE THE

00:58:26.870 --> 00:58:28.338
POTENTIAL FOR USING CONSUMER

00:59:07.543 --> 00:59:08.011
COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS FROM

00:59:08.077 --> 00:59:11.047
COMMITTEE MEMBERS.

00:59:11.114 --> 00:59:12.515
ASSEMBLYMEMBER EGGMAN FOR THE

00:59:12.582 --> 00:59:14.884
SAKE OF ASKING A QUESTION -- CAN

00:59:14.951 --> 00:59:16.519
YOU TALK ABOUT THE THE SOCIAL

00:59:16.586 --> 00:59:18.488
COST OF THE GREENHOUSE GAS

00:59:18.554 --> 00:59:20.056
EMISSIONS HOW IS A BALLOT UNDER

00:59:20.123 --> 00:59:22.091
THE CDC'S ANALYSIS WHEN WE TRY

00:59:22.158 --> 00:59:23.026
TO FIGURE OUT.

00:59:23.092 --> 00:59:24.994
WHAT CALIFORNIANS CAN ACTUALLY

00:59:25.061 --> 00:59:26.329
AFFORD?

00:59:26.396 --> 00:59:28.264
DEFINITELY APPRECIATE THE

00:59:28.331 --> 00:59:32.602
QUESTION -- SO THERE'S LANGUAGE

00:59:32.669 --> 00:59:34.437
IN THE BILL.

00:59:34.504 --> 00:59:37.040
SEE I CAN GO TO THE EXACT PAGE.

00:59:37.106 --> 00:59:38.775
THE BASICALLY ALLOWS THE

00:59:38.841 --> 00:59:40.777
COMMISSION TO CONSIDER.

00:59:40.843 --> 00:59:42.345
THE SOCIAL COST OF GREENHOUSE

00:59:42.412 --> 00:59:43.479
GASES.

00:59:43.546 --> 00:59:45.081
BUT IT FIRST HAS TO MAKE A

00:59:45.148 --> 00:59:46.416
FINDING.

00:59:46.482 --> 00:59:49.319
THAT THE THE APPLIANCE STANDARDS

00:59:49.385 --> 00:59:51.955
THAT CREATE THIS FLEXIBLE DEMAND

00:59:52.021 --> 00:59:53.222
DO NOT UNREASONABLY OR

00:59:53.289 --> 00:59:56.192
UNNECESSARILY IMPACT.

00:59:56.259 --> 00:59:58.361
THE THE COST EFFECTIVENESS

00:59:58.428 --> 00:59:59.729
ASPECT THAT'S THE FIRST AND

00:59:59.796 --> 01:00:01.831
FOREMOST THE EXISTING STATUTE OF

01:00:01.898 --> 01:00:04.167
THE COMMISSION OR ALSO THE

01:00:04.233 --> 01:00:07.170
ABILITY OF I INDIVIDUAL REPAIRS

01:00:07.236 --> 01:00:09.305
TO BUY THESE COMPLIANT

01:00:09.372 --> 01:00:09.605
APPLIANCES.

01:00:09.672 --> 01:00:10.773
SO.

01:00:10.840 --> 01:00:12.008
THE WAY WE'VE STRUCTURED THE

01:00:12.075 --> 01:00:13.977
BILL IS THAT THAT PROVISION

01:00:14.043 --> 01:00:17.347
WOULD NOT SUPERSEDE THE EXISTING

01:00:17.413 --> 01:00:18.681
COST EFFECTIVENESS.

01:00:18.748 --> 01:00:20.216
NOW THERE IS AN ISSUE ABOUT WHAT

01:00:20.283 --> 01:00:21.918
IS MEANT BY SOCIAL COSTS WE ARE

01:00:21.985 --> 01:00:23.553
WORKING RIGHT NOW.

01:00:23.619 --> 01:00:25.621
WITH THE SIMPLY ENERGY TO COME

01:00:25.688 --> 01:00:28.825
UP THE DEFINITION AND WE ARE.

01:00:28.891 --> 01:00:30.259
OBVIOUSLY SOCIAL COST COULD MEAN

01:00:30.326 --> 01:00:31.761
A LOT OF THINGS BUT WHAT WE ARE

01:00:31.828 --> 01:00:33.262
INTERESTED IN.

01:00:33.329 --> 01:00:35.431
IS HAVING IT BE COSTS TO

01:00:35.498 --> 01:00:38.434
RATEPAYERS IT DOESN'T RIGHT NOW

01:00:38.501 --> 01:00:41.037
THE STATUTE IS MORE SPECIFIC TO

01:00:41.104 --> 01:00:42.438
AN INDIVIDUAL RATE PAYER.

01:00:42.505 --> 01:00:43.906
BUT WHEN WE THINK ABOUT THINGS

01:00:43.973 --> 01:00:46.409
SUCH AS AVOIDED TRANSMISSION OR

01:00:46.476 --> 01:00:48.644
AVOIDED NEW INFRASTRUCTURE LIKE

01:00:48.711 --> 01:00:51.414
NEW GENERATION THOSE ARE COSTS

01:00:51.481 --> 01:00:52.949
THAT WOULD BENEFIT ALL RATE

01:00:53.016 --> 01:00:53.850
PAYERS.

01:00:53.916 --> 01:00:55.885
SO THE TYPE OF DEFINITION WE'RE

01:00:55.952 --> 01:00:58.688
LOOKING AT IS STILL WITH IN THAT

01:00:58.755 --> 01:01:04.427
RATE PAYER SPACE VERSUS YOU KNOW --

01:01:04.494 --> 01:01:06.696
AN UNLIMITED [inaudible]

01:01:06.763 --> 01:01:08.264
THE QUESTION.

01:01:08.331 --> 01:01:08.931
WHAT IS ONE OF THE THANK YOU FOR

01:01:08.998 --> 01:01:10.299
BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD --

01:01:10.366 --> 01:01:13.002
ABOUT TWELVE YEARS AGO WHEN I

01:01:13.069 --> 01:01:14.437
WAS ON THE GLENDALE CITY COUNCIL --

01:01:14.504 --> 01:01:16.372
I VOTED TO ALLOCATE ABOUT TWO

01:01:16.439 --> 01:01:17.807
HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS -- FROM

01:01:17.874 --> 01:01:19.842
THE CITY IN THE UTILITY TO MAKE

01:01:19.909 --> 01:01:20.910
GLENDALE THE FIRST CITY IN

01:01:20.977 --> 01:01:22.078
CALIFORNIA TO BE COMPLETELY

01:01:22.145 --> 01:01:23.646
SMART METER ON THE WATER AND THE

01:01:23.713 --> 01:01:24.213
POWER SIGNED.

01:01:24.280 --> 01:01:25.448
AND ONE OF THE PROMISES THAT WAS

01:01:25.515 --> 01:01:26.616
MADE AT THE TIME FROM THE

01:01:26.682 --> 01:01:28.151
UTILITY FOR THE INVESTMENT WAS

01:01:28.217 --> 01:01:29.552
THAT WE BECAUSE SO MANY PEOPLE

01:01:29.619 --> 01:01:30.987
HAVE SMART APPLIANCES.

01:01:31.054 --> 01:01:32.121
THAT THE RATE PAYERS EVEN THOUGH

01:01:32.188 --> 01:01:34.757
THERE WAS THIS INITIAL -- ACOSTA

01:01:34.824 --> 01:01:36.426
THE CITY WOULD HAVE TO BEAR IN

01:01:36.492 --> 01:01:37.593
THE END WE WOULD SAVE MONEY

01:01:37.660 --> 01:01:39.228
BECAUSE WE BE ABLE TO DEMAND

01:01:39.295 --> 01:01:40.730
MANAGEMENT PEOPLE COULD.

01:01:40.797 --> 01:01:42.065
TELL THEIR APPLIANCES TO RUN

01:01:42.131 --> 01:01:45.101
WHEN UP POWER WAS CHEAPEST I

01:01:45.168 --> 01:01:46.269
NONE OF THAT EVER CAME TO

01:01:46.335 --> 01:01:47.937
FRUITION AT THIS POINT AND NOW

01:01:48.004 --> 01:01:49.172
THE CITY'S LOOKING AT RE POWER A

01:01:49.238 --> 01:01:50.206
GAS POWER PLANT.

01:01:50.273 --> 01:01:51.674
AND THAT DEMAND MANAGEMENT IS NO

01:01:51.741 --> 01:01:54.043
WHERE IN THE EQUATION BECAUSE

01:01:54.110 --> 01:01:56.112
THAT FUNCTIONALITY IS NOT ONLINE

01:01:56.179 --> 01:01:57.413
EVEN THOUGH THE SMART METERS ARE

01:01:57.480 --> 01:01:58.448
CAPABLE OF DOING IT ON THEIR

01:01:58.514 --> 01:01:59.449
APPS TO DO IT.

01:01:59.515 --> 01:02:00.716
NONE OF THAT'S REALLY BEEN PUT

01:02:00.783 --> 01:02:02.085
TOGETHER YET AND CERTAINLY THE

01:02:02.151 --> 01:02:04.253
PRICING HASN'T BEEN INSTITUTED.

01:02:04.320 --> 01:02:06.689
SO THIS IS THE NEXT LOGICAL STEP

01:02:06.756 --> 01:02:09.692
TO EMPOWER REPAIRS. TO SAVE

01:02:09.759 --> 01:02:11.494
MONEY -- THE WITH THE

01:02:11.561 --> 01:02:12.495
INVESTMENTS THAT THEY'VE MADE

01:02:12.562 --> 01:02:13.529
THROUGH SMART METERS AND ALSO

01:02:13.596 --> 01:02:14.864
THROUGH BUYING APPLIANCES THAT

01:02:14.931 --> 01:02:16.866
ARE SMART METER READY SO I THINK

01:02:16.933 --> 01:02:17.533
THIS BILL IS GOING TO GO A LONG

01:02:17.600 --> 01:02:19.001
WAY IN HELPING PUT ALL OF THAT

01:02:19.068 --> 01:02:19.902
TOGETHER.

01:02:19.969 --> 01:02:21.003
AND I APPRECIATE YOUR COMING

01:02:21.070 --> 01:02:22.538

01:02:22.605 --> 01:02:23.840

SOME OF THE OPPOSITION CONCERNS

01:12:13.796 --> 01:12:19.301

WITH CAL CAN IN THE PROCESS --

01:12:24.573 --> 01:12:26.141
WE THINK THAT -- THE ONE OF

01:12:26.208 --> 01:12:30.145
THEIR SUGGESTED AMENDMENTS IS --

01:12:30.212 --> 01:12:31.647
IT WOULD PROVIDE SORT OF DETAIL

01:12:31.714 --> 01:12:33.649
DIRECTION -- NOT COMMONLY FOUND

01:12:33.716 --> 01:12:35.250
IN LEGISLATION BUT WE THINK WE

01:12:35.317 --> 01:12:38.053
CAN RESOLVE -- HOW TO ENSURE --

01:12:38.120 --> 01:12:39.621
THAT THE APPLICATION PROCESS IS

01:12:39.688 --> 01:12:40.989
STREAMLINED AND NOT DUPLICATE I

01:12:41.056 --> 01:12:42.825
MEAN THAT'S REALLY THE INTENT OF

01:12:42.891 --> 01:12:44.660
THIS LEGISLATION IS TO CREATE.

01:12:44.727 --> 01:12:46.595
A CALIFORNIA ANALOG -- TO THE

01:12:46.662 --> 01:12:48.530
INNER CS PROGRAMS AT THE FEDERAL

01:12:48.597 --> 01:12:50.632
LEVEL AND CANDIDLY PROGRAMS THAT

01:12:50.699 --> 01:12:52.568
WORK BETTER FOR SMALLER FARMERS

01:12:52.634 --> 01:12:55.270
AND FOR SPECIALTY CROP FARMERS

01:12:55.337 --> 01:12:57.206
IN CALIFORNIA -- THAT ARE NOT

01:12:57.272 --> 01:12:58.540

PROVIDING HABITAT ON

01:13:02.478 --> 01:13:03.412
AGRICULTURAL LAND SO I THINK

01:13:03.479 --> 01:13:05.948
THAT -- WE HAVE A DIALOGUE GOING

01:13:06.014 --> 01:13:07.082

WORK DONE BY YOU AND YOUR STAFF

01:14:26.061 --> 01:14:27.796
ON THIS.

01:14:27.863 --> 01:14:29.431
WE TALK A LOT ABOUT GREENHOUSE

01:14:29.498 --> 01:14:30.465
GAS EMISSION REDUCTION

01:14:30.532 --> 01:14:32.167
STRATEGIES AND OPPORTUNITIES OUT

01:14:32.234 --> 01:14:33.735
THERE BUT VERY RARELY DO WE

01:14:33.802 --> 01:14:35.470
FOCUS ON THE TREMENDOUS

01:14:35.537 --> 01:14:37.272
OPPORTUNITIES -- IN THE FOOD

01:14:37.339 --> 01:14:41.243
SECTOR -- WHEN IT COMES TO THE

01:14:41.310 --> 01:14:42.444
AGRICULTURE COMMUNITY I THINK

01:14:42.511 --> 01:14:43.812
THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WERE

01:14:43.879 --> 01:14:44.613
DOING SOME OF THE MOST ADVANCED

01:14:44.680 --> 01:14:46.615
WORK IN THE WORLD -- WHEN IT

01:14:46.682 --> 01:14:48.584
COMES TO GROWING OUR FOOD

01:14:48.650 --> 01:14:50.752
SUSTAINABLY IN MANNERS THAT

01:14:50.819 --> 01:14:52.921
REDUCE CARBON OR EVEN SEQUESTER

01:14:52.988 --> 01:14:53.689
THAT CARBON?

01:14:53.755 --> 01:14:55.290
AND I THINK IT'S TIME THE STATE

01:14:55.357 --> 01:14:58.160
ACTUALLY DID THE MATH AND LOOKED

01:14:58.227 --> 01:14:59.862
AT THE GREENHOUSE GAS IMPACT OF

01:14:59.928 --> 01:15:01.096
THE FOOD WE BUY FOR OURSELVES

01:15:01.163 --> 01:15:03.565
AND I THINK ONCE WE GET TO SOME

01:15:03.632 --> 01:15:04.833
OF THE TRUTH OF THAT MATH --

01:15:04.900 --> 01:15:06.635
WILL REALIZE THAT THERE ARE

01:15:06.702 --> 01:15:11.640
pTO FEED OURSELVES BUT ALSO --

01:15:11.707 --> 01:15:13.275
AND LOWER THE STATE'S CARBON

01:15:13.342 --> 01:15:14.710
FOOTPRINT AT THE SAME TIME AND

01:15:14.776 --> 01:15:16.678
HOPEFULLY IN A MANNER THAT --

01:15:16.745 --> 01:15:18.480
INCENTIVIZE IS OUR OUR GROWERS

IN OUR FARMERS TO KEEP DOING THE

01:15:20.682 --> 01:15:22.017

MARKETS -- WE'VE ALSO BEEN

01:16:10.465 --> 01:16:11.700
INSTRUMENTAL IN THE DEVELOPMENT

GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS AS

01:16:32.187 --> 01:16:32.988
PROVIDED.

01:16:33.055 --> 01:16:35.123
AND WOULD REQUIRE STATE AGENCY

01:16:35.190 --> 01:16:36.358
TO USE THIS METHODOLOGY TO

01:16:36.425 --> 01:16:38.694
PREPARE ITS ESTIMATE IS ESTIMATE

EXISTING RESEARCH AND LIFE CYCLE

01:16:45.634 --> 01:16:47.002
ANALYSIS OF FOOD.

01:16:47.069 --> 01:16:48.236
SO THAT STATE AGENCIES CAN

01:16:48.303 --> 01:16:49.471
INCLUDE FOOD EMISSIONS WITHIN

01:16:49.538 --> 01:16:51.640

CLIMATE OBJECTIVES. FOR ANY GAPS

01:16:59.247 --> 01:17:00.282
IN THE SCIENCE BETWEEN

CONVENTIONAL AND MORE

01:17:01.717 --> 01:17:03.085
PROGRESSIVE CLIMATE BENEFICIAL

01:17:03.151 --> 01:17:04.820
FOOD SYSTEMS THIS BILL COULD

01:17:04.886 --> 01:17:06.555
SERVE TO PROMOTE AND ENCOURAGE

01:17:06.621 --> 01:17:07.889
FURTHER LIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENT

01:17:07.956 --> 01:17:08.991
STUDIES ON THESE RESPECTIVE

01:17:09.057 --> 01:17:10.325
SYSTEMS.

01:17:10.392 --> 01:17:11.393
THE NEW SCIENCE IN TURN CAN BE

01:17:11.460 --> 01:17:12.427
FOLDED INTO METHODOLOGY

01:17:12.494 --> 01:17:13.795
REVISIONS THAT WOULD FURTHER

01:17:13.862 --> 01:17:15.697
SPUR THE STATE'S VENDORS TO

01:17:15.764 --> 01:17:17.299
UTILIZE FOOD PRODUCTION SYSTEMS

01:17:17.366 --> 01:17:18.500
THAT HARNESS THESE PROGRESSIVE

01:17:18.567 --> 01:17:19.935
PRACTICES.

01:17:20.002 --> 01:17:21.370
OF THE FORTY SOMETHING

01:17:21.436 --> 01:17:22.471
RESTAURANTS THAT HAVE RECEIVED A

01:17:22.537 --> 01:17:23.438
GREENHOUSE GAS ASSESSMENT FROM

01:17:23.505 --> 01:17:24.940
THREE DEGREES WE'VE OBSERVED A

01:17:25.007 --> 01:17:26.174
FAIR AMOUNT OF ENGAGEMENT BY THE

01:17:26.241 --> 01:17:27.909
RESTAURANT OWNERS TO IDENTIFY

01:17:27.976 --> 01:17:30.045
OPPORTUNITIES FOR REDUCTIONS.

01:17:30.112 --> 01:17:30.679
WE OFTEN RECEIVE SUCH QUESTIONS

01:17:30.746 --> 01:17:33.382
AS IS GRASS FED BEEF LESS

01:17:33.448 --> 01:17:34.950
GREENHOUSE GAS INTENSIVE THAN

01:17:35.017 --> 01:17:35.617
FEEDLOT BEEF.

01:17:35.684 --> 01:17:37.219
OR DID YOU ACCOUNT FOR THE LOCAL

01:17:37.285 --> 01:17:39.888
OYSTERS WE PURCHASE FROM TAMALES

01:17:39.955 --> 01:17:40.389
BAY THAT ARE SUSTAINABLY

01:17:40.455 --> 01:17:40.689
HARVESTED.

01:17:40.756 --> 01:17:42.124
WHILE WE DON'T ALWAYS HAVE A

01:17:42.190 --> 01:17:42.824
CLEAR UNDERSTANDING ON THE

01:17:42.891 --> 01:17:45.027
ACTUAL GREENHOUSE GAS SAVINGS

01:17:45.093 --> 01:17:46.128
FROM ONE SYSTEM OVER ANOTHER.

01:17:46.194 --> 01:17:47.562
I BRING THIS UP TO ILLUSTRATE

01:17:47.629 --> 01:17:48.330
THE TYPE OF THINKING THAT HAS

01:17:48.397 --> 01:17:50.065
SPURRED BY ASSESSING THE

01:17:50.132 --> 01:17:52.534
LIFECYCLE EMISSIONS.

01:17:52.601 --> 01:17:53.468
FROM FOOD PRODUCTION.

01:17:53.535 --> 01:17:54.036
WHEN THE STATE'S VENDORS ARE

01:17:54.102 --> 01:17:55.237
HELD ACCOUNTABLE TO THIS LEVEL

01:17:55.303 --> 01:17:57.039
TRANSPARENCY IT IS LIKELY TO

01:17:57.105 --> 01:17:57.973
ENGAGE MANY THOUGHTFUL

01:17:58.040 --> 01:17:59.574
DISCUSSIONS AROUND ALTERNATIVE

01:17:59.641 --> 01:18:01.576
FOODS PROCUREMENT WITH LOWER

01:18:01.643 --> 01:18:03.078
GREENHOUSE GAS INTENSITIES?

01:18:03.145 --> 01:18:04.246
THANKS FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO

01:18:04.312 --> 01:18:05.313
SPEAK TODAY I RESPECTFULLY URGE

WISHING TO VOICE SUPPORT FOR THE

01:18:13.121 --> 01:18:14.990
BILL.

01:18:15.057 --> 01:18:16.925
RATED ALSO AS THE ACT OF

01:18:16.992 --> 01:18:19.728
CALIFORNIANS SUPPORT.

01:18:19.795 --> 01:18:20.362
ALL RIGHT IS THERE ANYBODY HERE

01:18:20.429 --> 01:18:20.962
TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION TO THE

01:18:21.029 --> 01:18:23.131
BILL.

01:18:23.198 --> 01:18:24.800
OKAY SEEING NONE ARE THERE ANY

01:18:24.866 --> 01:18:26.068
MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE HAVE

01:18:26.134 --> 01:18:27.769
QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS SOME

01:18:27.836 --> 01:18:30.205
NUMBER EGGMAN.

01:18:30.272 --> 01:18:33.008
THANK YOU -- SINCE IT.

01:18:33.075 --> 01:18:33.608
SO ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT FOOD

01:18:33.675 --> 01:18:37.379
AND IT'S CONCEPTION.

01:18:37.446 --> 01:18:38.880
THE FULL LIFECYCLE THE FULL LIFE

01:18:38.947 --> 01:18:42.184
CYCLE FROM GROWING ALL THE WAY

01:18:42.250 --> 01:18:42.717
TO OUR PLACE IN THE STATE

01:18:42.784 --> 01:18:44.820
CAPITAL.

01:18:44.886 --> 01:18:46.354
WITH THE READ WITH THE WITH THE

01:18:46.421 --> 01:18:49.257
GOAL OF UNDERSTANDING A BETTER

01:18:49.324 --> 01:18:50.959
OR REDUCING IT OR THERE'S NO

01:18:51.026 --> 01:18:52.828
MANDATE FOR REDUCTION IN HERE

01:18:52.894 --> 01:18:55.030
BUT WE WE FEEL LIKE IF WE HAVE A

01:18:55.097 --> 01:18:56.398
MORE ACCURATE INVENTORY WE'RE

01:18:56.465 --> 01:18:58.934
GONNA HAVE OPPORTUNITIES TO SAY.

01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:00.001
FRIENDS IT'S A D. G. S. OKAY

01:19:00.068 --> 01:19:01.770
YOU'RE GOING TO BUY.

01:19:01.837 --> 01:19:03.038
FOOD.

01:19:03.105 --> 01:19:04.673
FOR THIS THAT THE STATE

01:19:04.739 --> 01:19:06.475
LEGISLATURE FRIENDS AND AND YOU

01:19:06.541 --> 01:19:08.310
HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO SAVE BY

01:19:08.376 --> 01:19:09.811
LOWER CARBON FOODS A PRODUCE IN

01:19:09.878 --> 01:19:11.146
THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA OR

01:19:11.213 --> 01:19:13.348
SOMETHING ELSE WHERE -- YOU KNOW

01:19:13.415 --> 01:19:14.683
GIVING THEM THAT INFORMATION WE

01:19:14.749 --> 01:19:15.817
FEEL LIKE THEY'RE GONNA MAKE

01:19:15.884 --> 01:19:17.819
SMARTER CHOICES BECAUSE THE

01:19:17.886 --> 01:19:19.488
OVERALL MANDATE IS.

01:19:19.554 --> 01:19:21.256
TO REDUCE CARBON SO. TO TRY TO

01:19:21.323 --> 01:19:23.558
BE AS THOROUGH AS WE CAN ALL THE

01:19:23.625 --> 01:19:24.459
WAY UPSTREAM WELL HELLO.

01:19:24.526 --> 01:19:28.497
BUT HOW WILL WE KNOW OUT OF

01:19:28.563 --> 01:19:29.164
COSTS.

01:19:29.231 --> 01:19:31.066
FOR OKAY SO I MEAN THE THE MOST

01:19:31.133 --> 01:19:32.334
ACCURATE DATA WE CAN POSSIBLY

01:19:32.400 --> 01:19:33.735
GET OBVIOUSLY IS IN STATE WHERE

01:19:33.802 --> 01:19:34.836
WE HAVE CONTROL ALL THE WAY OVER

01:19:34.903 --> 01:19:36.571
THE SOURCE AND YOU CAN GO TO A

01:19:36.638 --> 01:19:38.440
FARM IN OR STAND THEIR PRACTICES --

01:19:38.507 --> 01:19:41.543
BUT THE ESTIMATES AND OUR OUR

01:19:41.610 --> 01:19:42.677
OUR FRIEND HERE FROM THREE

01:19:42.744 --> 01:19:43.578
DEGREES IN PROBABLY WAY IN

01:19:43.645 --> 01:19:45.680
BETTER BUT THEIR THEIR ESTIMATES

01:19:45.747 --> 01:19:47.182
DID LOOK AT SAY INDIRECT LAND

01:19:47.249 --> 01:19:50.051
USE CHANGE IMPACTS FROM HOW THEY

01:19:50.118 --> 01:19:52.320
DO -- DAIRY PRODUCTION SAY IN

01:19:52.387 --> 01:19:54.789
NEW ZEALAND OR BRAZIL VERSES IN

01:19:54.856 --> 01:19:57.325
CALIFORNIA THAT -- THEY CAN AT

01:19:57.392 --> 01:19:58.593
LEAST GET SOMETHING THAT'S

01:19:58.660 --> 01:20:00.162
QUANTIFIABLE AND TRANSPARENT

01:20:00.228 --> 01:20:04.900
EVEN IF IT'S NOT PERFECT IT'S

01:20:04.966 --> 01:20:06.301
SOMETHING DIRECTIONAL SO I DON'T.

01:20:06.368 --> 01:20:07.135
I I DON'T OVER PROMISE WITH THIS

01:20:07.202 --> 01:20:08.270
IT IS GOING TO BE COMPLETELY

01:20:08.336 --> 01:20:08.904
PERFECT MATH BUT LIKE OUR LOW

01:20:08.970 --> 01:20:10.105
CARBON FUEL STANDARD IN SOME OF

01:20:10.172 --> 01:20:12.807
THESE OTHER -- TOOLS WE'VE GOT

01:20:12.874 --> 01:20:16.278
THE MATH ISN'T YOU KNOW -- WHEN

01:20:16.344 --> 01:20:16.878
WHEN YOU GET IN INTERNATIONAL

01:20:16.945 --> 01:20:18.246
MARKETS IT IT REALLY IS

01:20:18.313 --> 01:20:20.048
DEPENDENT ON GETTING THEM TO

01:20:20.115 --> 01:20:21.249
PARTICIPATE IN OUR SYSTEM SO IN

01:20:21.316 --> 01:20:22.184
THEORY?

01:20:22.250 --> 01:20:23.318
THEY WOULD PROVIDE BETTER DATA

01:20:23.385 --> 01:20:25.387
ADDED SOME OF THESE FOREIGN

01:20:25.453 --> 01:20:27.389
JURISDICTIONS TO IF THEY THEY

01:20:27.455 --> 01:20:30.659
WANT TO COMPETE IN CALIFORNIA.

01:20:30.725 --> 01:20:31.326
HI I MEAN JUST BECAUSE LIKE WHAT

01:20:31.393 --> 01:20:31.927
HAPPENS WITH SOME OF OUR OTHER

01:20:31.993 --> 01:20:32.561
THINGS WITH WHAT WE'RE ABLE TO

01:20:32.627 --> 01:20:33.895
CONTROL MORE IS IN THE STATE OF

01:20:33.962 --> 01:20:35.697
CALIFORNIA WHICH WE ALREADY HAVE

01:20:35.764 --> 01:20:36.398
THE MOST.

01:20:36.464 --> 01:20:37.799
CONTROLLED FOOD SUPPLY IN THE

01:20:37.866 --> 01:20:39.434
WORLD I DON'T THINK MANY WOULD

01:20:39.501 --> 01:20:41.503
ARGUE AND SO.

01:20:41.570 --> 01:20:43.038
IF WE'RE LOOKING AT REDUCING

01:20:43.104 --> 01:20:44.906
CARBON THROUGH THAT VERSES

01:20:44.973 --> 01:20:46.975
GLOBALLY I GUESS I JUST THEM I

01:20:47.042 --> 01:20:48.677
AM VERY CONFUSED ABOUT HOW THIS

01:20:48.743 --> 01:20:50.045
WOULD WORK I MEAN.

01:20:50.111 --> 01:20:52.414
MY THESIS IN THIS IS HOPEFULLY

01:20:52.480 --> 01:20:53.548
JUST A STEP TO GET SOME

01:20:53.615 --> 01:20:55.317
TRANSPARENCY IN DATA INTO THE

01:20:55.383 --> 01:20:57.118
SYSTEM BUT I THINK I AGREE WITH

01:20:57.185 --> 01:20:58.353
YOU I THINK CALIFORNIA

01:20:58.420 --> 01:21:00.021
AGRICULTURE IS THE LEADER IN THE

01:21:00.088 --> 01:21:01.423
WORLD AND I DON'T THINK THEY'RE

01:21:01.489 --> 01:21:03.525
GETTING ENOUGH CREDIT FRANKLY

01:21:03.592 --> 01:21:04.125
FOR THE WORK THEY'RE DOING AND

01:21:04.192 --> 01:21:04.859
SO.

01:21:04.926 --> 01:21:06.628
HOPEFULLY BY DOING SOME OF THE

01:21:06.695 --> 01:21:07.362
SOME OF THIS CARBON INVENTORY

01:21:07.429 --> 01:21:09.864
WORK WILL BE ABLE TO BRING THAT%

01:21:09.931 --> 01:21:10.966
TO LIGHT SAY IN OUR DAIRY

01:21:11.032 --> 01:21:12.867
INDUSTRY OR IN OUR BEEF INDUSTRY

01:21:12.934 --> 01:21:13.568
OR IN.

01:21:13.635 --> 01:21:15.103
IN A SPECIALTY CROPS AND THINGS

01:21:15.170 --> 01:21:16.238
LIKE THAT SO THAT THAT'S THE

01:21:16.304 --> 01:21:17.739
HOPING JUST STARTING WITH

01:21:17.806 --> 01:21:18.873
SOMETHING WE DO HAVE CONTROL

01:21:18.940 --> 01:21:20.775
OVER WHICH IS THE STATE'S FOOD

01:21:20.842 --> 01:21:22.377
BUDGET THIS DOESN'T GET INTO.

01:21:22.444 --> 01:21:23.678
WHAT WE NEEDED PRIVATE

01:21:23.745 --> 01:21:24.546
RESTAURANTS AND THINGS LIKE THAT

01:21:24.613 --> 01:21:26.381
BUT HOPEFULLY THE MARKET STARTS

01:21:26.448 --> 01:21:28.850
TO GO THAT WAY I THINK IT COULD

01:21:28.917 --> 01:21:29.384
BE A BIG LIFT [inaudible]

01:21:29.451 --> 01:21:33.388
FOR CALIFORNIA [inaudible]

01:21:33.455 --> 01:21:37.125
ANYBODY ELSE [inaudible]

01:21:37.192 --> 01:21:41.730
ASSEMBLYMEMBER MELENDEZ

01:21:41.796 --> 01:21:42.030
[inaudible]

01:21:42.097 --> 01:21:43.265
WHY HAD?

01:21:43.331 --> 01:21:44.799
SOME OF THE SAME QUESTIONS AT MY

RESTAURANT SECTOR FOR THOSE

01:24:38.039 --> 01:24:39.707

HELP CLEAR SOME HEARINGS OUTSIDE

01:24:41.409 --> 01:24:45.380

01:24:45.447 --> 01:24:46.381
I THINK IT'S HELP CLEARED UP --

01:24:46.448 --> 01:24:46.915
REALLY THE BEST WAY TO TO

01:24:46.981 --> 01:24:47.882
MEASURE THE LIFE CYCLE

01:24:47.949 --> 01:24:50.585
ASSESSMENT OF FOODS IS THROUGH --

01:24:50.652 --> 01:24:51.419
LOOK.

01:24:51.486 --> 01:24:51.953
FRIENDS OF STUDIES OF THE

01:24:52.020 --> 01:24:54.122
SYSTEMS THEMSELVES RATHER THAN

01:24:54.189 --> 01:24:57.125
THE FOLLOWING THE ACTUAL CHAIN

01:24:57.192 --> 01:24:58.660
OF EVENTS THAT BROUGHT THE FOOD

01:24:58.726 --> 01:25:03.898
TO THE PLATE HERE IN CALIFORNIA --

01:25:03.965 --> 01:25:07.435
EXACT ACCOUNTING -- OF EACH AND

01:25:07.502 --> 01:25:08.703
EVERY FOOD SYSTEM.

01:25:08.770 --> 01:25:09.704
YOU KNOW REPEATEDLY THROUGHOUT

01:25:09.771 --> 01:25:13.341
THE YEAR BUT MORE OF A YOU KNOW

01:25:13.408 --> 01:25:14.375
WHAT WHAT DOES IT TAKE TO

01:25:14.442 --> 01:25:15.310
PRODUCE.

01:25:15.376 --> 01:25:17.345
A POTATO WHAT IS A PRETTY TAKE

01:25:17.412 --> 01:25:19.447
TO PRODUCE -- YOU KNOW --

01:25:19.514 --> 01:25:21.583
WATERMELON OR CHICKEN -- AND

01:25:21.649 --> 01:25:23.485
FROM THAT YOU HAVE SORT OF A YOU

01:25:23.551 --> 01:25:26.154
CAN YOU CAN MAKE A NUMBER AND

01:25:26.221 --> 01:25:27.956
PUT IN A DATABASE.

01:25:28.022 --> 01:25:29.591
AND THAT NUMBER COULD BE USED

01:25:29.657 --> 01:25:31.292
WITHOUT REALLY -- HOLDING ANY

01:25:31.359 --> 01:25:34.929
PARTICULAR -- YOU KNOW.

01:25:34.996 --> 01:25:35.663
IT'S IT'S NOT LIKE YOU'RE

01:25:35.730 --> 01:25:37.532
LOOKING AT THE EMISSIONS ACROSS

01:25:37.599 --> 01:25:38.199
THE DIFFERENT COUNTRIES THAT MAY

01:25:38.266 --> 01:25:39.267
HAVE BROUGHT THAT WATER DOWN

01:25:39.334 --> 01:25:40.902
HERE BUT THE OVERALL.

01:25:40.969 --> 01:25:42.871
IMPACT OF THAT WATERMELON.

01:25:42.937 --> 01:25:44.172
HERE ON THE PLATE IN CALIFORNIA.

01:25:44.239 --> 01:25:46.374
AND SO OVER TIME WE MIGHT FIND

01:25:46.441 --> 01:25:48.343
THAT THERE IS -- WATERMELONS

01:25:48.409 --> 01:25:51.179
PRODUCED -- SOMEONE THE WAITER

01:25:51.246 --> 01:25:52.614
AND ALSO WATERMELONS.

01:25:52.680 --> 01:25:53.314
A LITTLE BIT CLOSER TO

01:25:53.381 --> 01:25:55.817
CALIFORNIA -- THERE MAY BE

01:25:55.884 --> 01:25:57.385
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THOSE.

01:25:57.452 --> 01:25:58.119
TWO FROM A SYSTEMATIC VIEW

01:25:58.186 --> 01:25:59.854
POINTS AND THEN THAT CAN LEAD TO

01:25:59.921 --> 01:26:02.056
DECISION MAKING AROUND THE MORE

01:26:02.123 --> 01:26:03.458
LOCAL PRODUCTS.

01:26:03.525 --> 01:26:05.059
AND IF I COULD JUST ADD I THINK.

01:26:05.126 --> 01:26:06.461
WHAT WE'VE SEEN AT LEAST THE

01:26:06.528 --> 01:26:07.428
AIRPORT YOU IN THE PAST AND

01:26:07.495 --> 01:26:08.663
THEY'VE DONE THESE INVENTORIES

01:26:08.730 --> 01:26:10.365
WHEN YOU DON'T HAVE THE DATA?

01:26:10.431 --> 01:26:12.233
THEY PICK A HIGH BASELINE FOR

01:26:12.300 --> 01:26:12.867
YOU AND YOU'RE STUCK WITH THE

01:26:12.934 --> 01:26:14.502
DEFAULT IF YOU CAN PROVIDE THE

01:26:14.569 --> 01:26:16.437
DATA THEN YOU CAN PROVE THAT

01:26:16.504 --> 01:26:17.038
YOU'RE GOING TO BE LOWER THAN

01:26:17.105 --> 01:26:18.373
THAT RIGHT.

01:26:18.439 --> 01:26:19.908
BUT I THINK.

01:26:19.974 --> 01:26:22.544
I I I HAVE QUITE THE OPPOSITE

01:26:22.610 --> 01:26:24.445
INTENT TO DO ANYTHING TO BUY

01:26:24.512 --> 01:26:25.713
SINCE STATE FARMERS AYE I

01:26:25.780 --> 01:26:26.714
ACTUALLY THINK IS GOING TO BE A

01:26:26.781 --> 01:26:32.086
BOOST FOR THEM STATION THAT.

01:26:32.153 --> 01:26:33.521
PUSHES BACK AGAINST OUT OF STATE

01:26:33.588 --> 01:26:35.423
COMMERCE -- BUT LOOKING AT

01:26:35.490 --> 01:26:36.691
CARBON I THINK IS ACTUALLY A

01:26:36.758 --> 01:26:37.926
REALLY USEFUL TOOL THAT GIVE US

01:26:37.992 --> 01:26:39.360
CREDIT FOR ALL THE WORK THEY'RE

01:26:39.427 --> 01:26:40.595
DOING IN STATE AND THEN THOSE

01:26:40.662 --> 01:26:42.463
WHO AT A STATE THEY DON'T WANT.

01:26:42.530 --> 01:26:43.298
TO GIVE US THAT INFORMATION WELL

01:26:43.364 --> 01:26:45.066
I MEAN IT'S UP TO THE AGENCY

01:26:45.133 --> 01:26:46.634
REPORT CARD PROCESS BUT IN

01:26:46.701 --> 01:26:48.436
THEORY YOU KNOW YOU GET HIT WITH

01:26:48.503 --> 01:26:50.605
A HIGH SCORE AND THAT'S A STACK

01:26:50.672 --> 01:26:51.072
UP.

01:26:51.139 --> 01:26:52.073
I MEAN THAT THAT'S THE THAT'S

01:26:52.140 --> 01:26:53.174
THE INTENT OF THE BILL AND I'M

01:26:53.241 --> 01:26:56.844
OPEN TO TRYING TO REFINE THAT TO

01:26:56.911 --> 01:26:57.912
REALLY MAKE CLEAR THAT.

01:26:57.979 --> 01:26:58.746
WE DON'T WANT TO BE AN

01:26:58.813 --> 01:27:00.648
ADDITIONAL REGULATORY BURDEN ON

01:27:00.715 --> 01:27:04.352
OUR END STATE FOLKS -- BUT I

01:27:04.419 --> 01:27:06.654
THINK THE MATH WILL HELP US.

01:27:06.721 --> 01:27:08.323
OKAY AND JUST A FINAL THOUGHT WE

01:27:08.389 --> 01:27:11.926
