WE'RE GOING TO ASK YOU TO START WITH -- S. B. SIX NINETEEN IF YOU DON'T MIND AND WILL PROCEED ONCE WE HAVE A QUORUM ALL. MISTER CHAIRMAN OF COURSE I DON'T MIND. QUITE THE CONTRARY VERY GRATEFUL TO YOU THANK YOU. FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY TO HEAR S. B.. SIX WHICH ONE OF MY HEARING FIRST. SIX ONE NINE PERFECT THANK YOU. YES THIS -- THIS BILL -- FIRST OF ALL FOR THANK YOU. FOR THE PROPOSED AMENDMENTS -- WE ARE -- TAKING THE AMENDMENTS PROVIDER PAGE FOUR AND FIVE OF THE ANALYSIS. AND THANK YOU FOR THAT -- THIS IS -- A VERY -- IMPORTANT BILL BECAUSE IT IT IT IS HELPS PEOPLE THAT LIVE IN -- PROMISE ZONE AREA -- PROMISE OWN BEING THE FEDERAL PROGRAM ESTABLISHED BY -- FORMER PRESIDENT OBAMA. TO CREATE REINVESTMENT IN UNDERSERVED AND UNDER INVESTED COMMUNITIES -- THIS BILL WILL ALLOW ALLOW THERE TO BE RENT REPORTING PILOT PROGRAM FOR PEOPLE. WHO RAN TO HELP THEM ESTABLISH A CREDIT RATING -- FOR SOME REASON -- YOU KNOW CREDIT RATINGS ARE ARE ARE ONLY PROVIDED TO PEOPLE PAY A MORTGAGE BUT PEOPLE WHO. WHO DECIDE TO RENT AND PREFER TO RENT OFTEN TIMES ARE NOT GIVEN CREDIT FOR THEIR TIMELY PAYMENTS? AND ALL OUR EFFORTS OR TRY TO HELP PEOPLE ESTABLISH CREDIT. A CREDIT IS OFTEN TIMES -- THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN -- PEOPLE BEING ABLE TO FINANCE A SORT OF BUSINESS OR THE PURCHASE OF AN AUTOMOBILE OR OR SOME ESSENTIAL NEED. THAT IS IMPORTANT TO THEIR PROSPERITY. AND WE YOU KNOW WE'VE SEEN THAT -- SPECIALLY LOW INCOME PEOPLE TEND TO NOT HAVE OPPORTUNITIES TO GET ACCESS TO CREDIT. AND THIS IS OUR OPPORTUNITY TO DO THAT. FOR OUR COMMUNITY -- ACCORDING TO THE CONSUMER FINANCE PROTECTION BUREAU 45% OF THE INDIVIDUALS IN HIGH POVERTY NEIGHBORHOODS. ARE CREDIT INVISIBLE COURT ON SCORE OVAL SIXTY MILLION U. S. ADULTS HAVE CREDIT SCORES LOWER THAN. SIX HUNDRED AND FIFTY FIFTY MILLION PEOPLE HAVE NO CREDIT SCORES AT ALL DO TOO LITTLE OR NO BORROWING HISTORY. RENT REPORTING. IS WHEN TENANTS MONTHLY RENTAL PAYMENTS ARE FURNISHED TO A CONSUMER CREDIT BUREAU SO THEY CAN BE INCLUDED IN THEIR CREDIT REPORT. FOR MOST TENANTS RENT IS THE LARGEST PAYMENT THEY MAKE EACH MONTH. AND ESPECIALLY IN CALIFORNIA WITH OUR RENT -- RATES GROWING AS MUCH AS THEY HAVE IN RECENT YEARS. AND HAVE A HOUSING SHORTAGE IS ALSO CREATING -- THIS UNDUE BURDENS AND THE PEOPLE OF OUR STATE [inaudible] AND THEY THEY MAKE. PAYMENTS EVERY MONTH WITHOUT RECEIVING ANY KIND OF CREDIT. BENEFIT FOR A TRADITIONAL. OR THAT -- THAT A TRADITIONAL MORTGAGE HOLDER WOULD WOULD RECEIVE SO THIS BILL WOULD ESTABLISH THAT PROGRAM. IT WOULD BE. A ON OPT IN PROGRAM IT WOULD BE OPTIONAL FOR THE PEOPLE THAT PARTICIPATE. INCLUDING IN OTHER PEOPLE THAT -- HOST -- THESE PROGRAMS -- AGAIN OUR OUR GOAL IS TO CREATE. ACCESS TO CREDIT. AND I ASKED YOU. TO HELP ME ESTABLISH THIS YEAR INSTEAD OF CALIFORNIA WITHIN OUR PROMISE ON AREAS IN CALIFORNIA. AND WE HAVE A FEW WITNESSES HERE THAT LIKE TO TESTIFY IF YOU ALLOW THAT MISTER CHAIRMAN.

ON TIME RENTAL PAYMENTS TO TWO OUT OF THREE MAJOR CREDIT BUREAUS AND THIS PARTNERSHIP TOOK US ABOUT THREE MONTHS TO DEVELOP AND IMPLEMENT. IN ABOUT A HUNDRED TWENTY MULTI FAMILY HOUSING -- COMMUNITIES. AND WE FOUND THAT PRIOR TO THE PROGRAM 40% OF OUR OF OUR ROWLEY'S DIDN'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT CHECKING THEIR CREDIT REPORT. OR ABOUT THEIR CREDIT CORE AND NOW SIXTY THREE POINT FIVE OF THEIR ROWLEY'S KNOW HOW TO CHECK THEIR CREDIT SCORE REGULARLY -- AND SINCE WE STARTED WE HAVE A SEVENTY EIGHT PARTICIPANTS FROM OUR THREE COMMUNITIES -- TWO IN SACRAMENTO AND ONE IN DAVIS AND THROUGH THIS PARTNERSHIP RESIDENT MEMBERS HAVE BEEN ABLE TO SEE AN IMMEDIATE AN IMMEDIATE BOOST AND THEIR CREDIT SCORES. ONCE THEY ENROLL IN THE PROGRAM BECASE NOW THEY'RE ON TIME RENT PAYMENTS ARE BEING REPORTED AND IT DATES BACK TO YEARS. AND OUR DATA SHOWS THAT THE AVERAGE INCREASE IN SCORES IS FORTY POINTS. AND ABOUT 11% OF ENROLLEES HAVE BEEN ABLE TO ESTABLISH CREDIT FOR THE FIRST TIME. THIS THAT'S ME YES. PLEASE I AM ANDREW I AM A RESIDENT FROM MUTUAL HOUSING -- I ENROLLED IN THIS PROGRAM A YEAR AND A HALF AGO WHEN IT STARTED BECAUSE I WANTED TO ARE YOUTO GET IT TO AT OUR APARTMENT FIRST AND WE DID. SO -- I HAVE A THING PARTICULARLY IN THIS PROGRAM YOUNG PEOPLE CAN BUILD THEIR CREDIT WE HAVE A FEW IN OUR COMMUNITY THAT ARE TWENTY ONE THAT ARE NOW ACCESSING THE PROGRAM AND THEY'RE BUILDING THEIR CREDIT. AND THEN WE ALSO HAVE IN DAVIS YOU CAN ADD TWO COMMUNITY RESIDENTS THAT ARE OVER EIGHTEEN THERE NOW BUILDING THEIR CREDIT AND MAXIMIZING IT. SO THEY CAN DO BETTER THINGS WITH THEIR LIVES AND WITH THIS PROGRAM ALSO GIVES OTHER PEOPLE THAT ARE RESTRICTED INCOME. TO BUILD THEIR CREDIT AND GIVEN THAT THEY HAVE AB FINANCIALLY RESTRAINED LIKE OTHER PEOPLE IN MY COMMUNITY A LADY THAT I KNOW HER AT CREDIT WENT UP A HUNDRED TWENTY POINT. WHEN SHE SIGNED UP BECAUSE SHE'S BEEN PAYING HER RENT FOR THE LAST TWO YEARS ON TIME EVERY MONTH BECAUSE THAT'S ONE THING WE HAVE TO DO WE GOT THE PATE?

THAT MEASURE HAS FIVE VOTES WILL KEEP TO ROLL OPEN FOR THOSE APPS TO MEMBERS -- NEXT UP IS S. B. FIVE TO EIGHT THANK YOU LADIES THANK YOU FOR YOUR TESTIMONY. NO HE'S NOT. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN -- SP FIVE TO EIGHT IS A BILL THAT WOULD ESTABLISH THE INFRASTRUCTURE AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT BANK COMMISSION. AND PLACE THE I I BANK UNDER THE SUPERVISION OF THE COMMISSION. AT THE OUTSET I'D LIKE TO COMMIT TO ADOPT AN AMENDMENT SO WHAT ADDRESS THE ISSUES RAISED. IN COMMON TWELVE SPECIFICALLY I'M WILLING TO ADOPT AMENDMENTS. WHICH WOULD CREATE A TASK FORCE TO STUDY THE WORKABILITY AND AND VIABILITY POTENTIAL AND POTENTIAL COSTS. AN ESTIMATED TIME FRAME TO IMPLEMENT. THE APPROACH OUTLINE OF SP FIVE TWENTY EIGHT TO ESTABLISH -- THE THE INFRASTRUCTURE BANK. IN ADDITION THIS COMMISSION. WOULD BE TASKED WITH PRODUCING -- RECOMMENDATION TO THE LEGISLATURE. AND IT IS MY UNDERSTANDING THAT -- MY STAFF WILL CONTINUE WORKING WITH THE SENATE BANKING STAFF TO ADOPT THE AMENDMENTS IN THE CENTER PREPARATIONS COMMITTEE. THAT WOULD INCLUDE A PROVISION WHICH WOULD TRIGGER FUTURE ACTION IN THE EVENT THE COMMISSION DETERMINES THIS PLAN. IS VIABLE AND END A WORTHY OF OF ADOPTION. ACCORDING TO RECENT ESTIMATES CALIFORNIA WILL NEED TO INVEST MORE THAN. SEVEN HUNDRED BILLION. OVER THE NEXT DECADE THE PUBLIC FACILITIES TO SERVE A GROWING POPULATION. UNDER GREAT UPGRADING SCHOOL UNIVERSITY BUILDINGS -- MAINTAINING HIGHWAYS AND PUBLIC TRANSIT SYSTEMS. AND ALSO MAKE IN OUR WATER SYSTEM ADEQUATE RELIABLE AND OF COURSE A SUSTAINABLE FINANCING COSTS INCLUDING ISSUANCE FEES INTEREST PAYMENTS. AT AT A NEAR TERM OF OF AT A 4% RATE [inaudible] US. TRANSACTION FEES ISSUED BY COOK COMMERCIAL BANK. BANKS WOULD ADD UP ALMOST ANOTHER SEVEN HUNDRED MILLION. FOR A TYPICAL A THIRTY YEAR TIME FRAME. THAT TOTAL COULD BE HIGHER IF INTEREST RATES GO UP. THIS IS -- TROUBLESOME NUMBER BUT IT GIVES US AN IDEA OF THE MAGNITUDE THAT FINANCING COSTS -- COSTS ARE OR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. OTHER COUNTRIES HAVE ATTENDED THE ADDRESS THIS ISSUE. GERMANY'S PUBLIC BANK THE K. F. W.. IS LARGER THAN THE WORLD BANK WITH ASSETS OF SIX HUNDRED BILLION AS OF TWENTY SIXTEEN K. F. W. HAS. HELPED FUND GERMANY'S GREEN REVOLUTION BY OFFERING VERY LOW INTEREST RATES RANGING FROM 123%. A CALIFORNIA PAT BUT PUBLIC BANKING OPTION WOULD PROVIDE SERVICES. ONLY TO A LIMITED OF QUALIFIED MUNICIPALITIES AND J. P. A.'S. THAT HAVEN'T MINIMAL RISK OF DEFAULT OR OR THE NEED TO RESTRUCTURE LOANS. THE CALIFORNIA INFRASTRUCTURE AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT BANK IS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IS ONLY GENERAL PURPOSE FINANCING AUTHORITY. THE I. BANKERS TWENTY YEARS OF EXPERIENCE IN MAKING PRUDENT INFRASTRUCTURE LOANS AT BELOW MUNICIPAL BOND RATES AS OF JULY TWENTY EIGHTEEN I BANK HAS FINANCED OVER THIRTY EIGHT BILLION. AND INFRASTRUCTURE AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS. THE I. BANK HOWEVER COULD NOT ACCEPT DEVELOP THE DEPOSITS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. HAS APPROXIMATELY. TWO HUNDRED BILLION DOLLARS A YEAR IN DEPOSITS THESE DEPOSITS CAN BE LEVERAGED TO PROVIDE. THESE ARE VERY IMPORTANT LOANS TO OUR STATE AT VERY LOW INTEREST RATES WHICH WOULD NOT ONLY EARNED OUR STATE A RETURN. ON OUR INVESTMENT BUT ALSO HELP TO GET ACCESS TO CAPITAL FOR THE FOR THESE **** BELLY TO VERY LOW RATES [inaudible] SO. DESPITE THESE LIMITATIONS THE I. BANK EXPERIENCE STEADY DEMAND FOR IT THE THE THE THE THE LOAN PROGRAM THAT THEY OFFER WHICH WITH. NINETY EIGHT ENQUIRIES IN FISCAL YEAR TWENTY SIXTEEN TWENTY SEVENTEEN FOR NEARLY FIVE HUNDRED SEVENTY THREE MILLION. IN INFRASTRUCTURE AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS IMAGINE WHAT WE COULD DO IF THAT BANK HAD MONEY. I HAVE WITH ME -- JON BATISTE HE'S A RETIRED BANK WITH OVER FORTY YEARS OF EXPERIENCE IN ASSET PROTECTION PROFITABILITY AND ASSET GROWTH JOHN WAS THE FORMER. REGIONAL VICE PRESIDENT OF NATIONAL BANK OF CALIFORNIA AND HE'S A WEALTH OF KNOWLEDGE IN NOT ONLY. STARTING BANKS BEGINNING BANKS BUT HOW A STATE BANK COULD BETTER SERVE THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA. BUT WHAT WITH THE PERMISSION OF THE CHAIR. YES I AM. THANK YOU VERY MUCH LADIES AND GENTLEMAN FOR ALLOWING ME -- TO TO COME TODAY -- IT'S A PLEASURE MY PLEASURE -- I'VE BEEN LOOKING INTO -- PUBLIC BANKING FOR THE LAST THREE YEARS ACTUALLY SINCE THE BEGINNING OF TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN I'LL GIVE YOU JUST A LITTLE BIT OF MY BACKGROUND IN BANKING -- AS STATED I'VE HAVE OVER FORTY YEARS OF BANKING -- MOSTLY AT 99% OF IT WAS BUSINESS BANKING NOW -- AND I'M NOT A RETAIL BANKING OFFICER -- I'VE CONSULTED WITH -- RECENTLY MOST RECENTLY WITH ATTORNEYS LOOKING TO BUY A BANK -- I'VE ALSO WORKED WITH PEOPLE -- OUTSIDE OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IN ESTABLISHING -- NEW BANKS -- IN TODAY'S WORLD WE WE GENERALLY LOOK -- TO ACQUIRE EXISTING BANKS BECAUSE WE WE LIKE THE CHART WITH -- HI I IN ADDITION TO BANKING I I SPENT YEARS WORKING WITH NON PROFITS THANKS TO THE FAIR HOUSING -- WOMEN'S KERR COTTAGE -- SAN FERNANDO VALLEY LEGAL FOUNDATION AND THE AMERICAN CANCER SOCIETY ON THESE ENTITIES I MEAN THE BAND BOARD MEMBERS PRESIDENTS A CHAIRMAN OF THE BOARD -- TOO I HAVE SOME KNOWLEDGE OF NONPROFIT ENTITIES -- THE I HAVE A HAT WORKED WITH PRESIDENTS -- THREE MAJOR BANKS IN TURNING AROUND BANKS -- WE WE HAD ONE BANK THAT -- IS A BIT MULTI BILLION DOLLAR BANK THAT HAD A LOSS OF OVER ELEVEN MILLION WE CONVERTED THAT BANK. TO NOMINAL PROFIT AND WE SOLD THE BANK. SO WE HAVE SOME EXPERIENCE IN HOW BANKS OPERATE HOW WHAT IT TAKES TO MAKE THEM BE SUCCESSFUL. AW I'VE. LATCHED ON AT THE END I USE THAT LOOSELY -- TO THE THE THOUGHT OF CONVERTING THE ALLIED BANK BECAUSE IT'S SOMETHING THAT'S ALREADY THERE -- IS NOT SOMETHING YOU HAVE TO START FROM SCRATCH AS I SAID MOST BANKERS NOW LOOKING TO ACQUIRE EXISTING BANKS. BECAUSE IT IS JUST CHEAPER AND IF IT WORKS A LOT EASIER FOR THEM -- THE I'D MAKE KIDS OVER FIFTEEN YEARS TO MY KNOWLEDGE NEARLY TWENTY YEARS OF OF OPERATING SUCCESSFULLY AND LENDING -- TO PRIMARILY MUNICIPALITIES FOR INFRASTRUCTURE. IMPROVEMENT -- I I DO AGREE THAT -- A BASE ON MY UNDERSTANDING THAT IT WILL BE IN THE BILLIONS OF DOLLARS THE HUNDREDS OF BILLIONS OF DOLLARS TO DO WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE -- FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA TO BRING OUR INFRASTRUCTURE. UP TO WHERE IT SHOULD BE AND TO ADD TO WHAT IS NEEDED IN THE STATE -- ONE OF THE REASONS I LIKE THE I BANK IS BECAUSE IF YOU LOOK IF WE WERE ABLE TO JUST SAVE. A QUARTER OF A PERCENT LESS IF IN EIGHTH OF A PERCENT. OF BRANHAM ON NOT ALONE -- THAT SAVES US OVER A MILLION DOLLARS -- AND YOU MULTIPLY THAT OVER A TWENTY YEAR LOAN THAT'S A SUBSTANTIAL SAVINGS -- I BELIEVE THAT -- THAT CAN BE DONE -- THE PRESENT STATE OF THE I. BANK IS THAT IT BORROWS MONEY THROUGH BONDS AND SO FORTH TO SUPPORT ITS ACTIVITIES -- IT HAS A RESTRICTED RESTRICTION ON ITS CAPITAL -- JUST EXAMINING THE THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF THE THE PREVIOUS YEAR IT COULD HAVE DOUBLED WHAT -- IT MADE -- IF THE RESTRICTIONS WERE NOT THERE -- AND THEREFORE I I BELIEVE THAT IF THE STATE CAPITALIZE THE THE THE I BANK PROPERLY -- IT CAN IT CAN NOT ONLY DO WELL IT CAN DO VERY WELL OVER A RELATIVELY SHORT PERIOD OF TIME -- THE BIGGEST HICK UP WITH WITH DOING A COMMERCIAL BANK OF CONVERTING THE I. BANK TO A COMMERCIAL BANK IS THE LACK OF THE POSITIVE SUPPORT -- THE NEED FOR FUNDS. I BELIEVE THAT CAN BE DONE -- I I HAVE A SCENE THE LETTER FROM THERE SEE I YOU -- DAVE ALSO ATTENDED MEETINGS THAT I HAVE. BEEN A PART OF WHERE THEY'VE EXPRESSED THEIR SUPPORT OF A PUBLIC BANK I'VE ALSO HAD OTHER UNIONS -- MAJOR UNIONS PARTICIPATE IN SOME OF THE FORMS THAT I'VE BEEN A PART OF AND THEY ALSO SUPPORT THE IDEA OF A PUBLIC BANK. OF FOR THE SIMPLE REASON THAT IT NOT ONLY THE THE NUMBER I GAVE YOU AN EIGHTH OF A POINT TO IT WHICH IS JUST A GAS -- KNOWING HOW BANKS OPERATE IT CAN BE MORE -- THEY ALSO SEE THE FEES SINCE AND CHARGES THAT COME FROM DEALING WITH YOUR NORMAL COMMERCIAL BANK. THOSE FEES AND CHARGES -- COULD BE ELIMINATED ALL GO TOWARDS -- THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA -- THE IDEA IS NOT TO HAVE A NON PROFIT IT WILL BE A FOR PROFIT BANK THE MAJOR DIFFERENCE IS. THE PROFIT COMES AT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA -- AND THE FIGHT THAT BANKS ARE -- OBVIOUSLY BEING A SUCCESSFUL. WE BELIEVE THAT -- THE ALLIED BANK -- CAN ALSO BE SUCCESSFUL. ARMED. WITNESSES IN SUPPORT OF THIS MEASURE. WHICH COMPORT. DAVID KING TOWN ON BEHALF OF DEMOCRACY COLLABORATIVE WE'RE PROUD TO BE THE SPONSORS OF THE BILL. THANK YOU. ANY ADDITIONAL WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. SEEN HERE NINE WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. JASON LANE CALIFORNIABANKERS ASSOCIATION WE'D -- VERY MUCH LIKE TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE AUTHOR AND COMMITTEE STAFF. AND THE COMMITTEE IN WORKING WITH US ON AMENDMENTS TO THE MEASURE WE THINK -- THE RECENT AMENDMENTS ACCEPTED -- NAMELY THE TASK FORCE TO CREATE THE WORKER WORKABILITY SCOPE DOCUMENT IS A STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION -- IMPENDING REVIEW OF WHAT THE LANGUAGE LOOKS LIKE RELATIVE TO A TRIGGER -- TO MOVE FORWARD WE RESERVE THE RIGHT TO POTENTIALLY -- REMOVE OUR OPPOSITION TO THE MEASURE. THANK YOU THE QUICKNESS. MARK LAST SEEN ABOUT HALF THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY BANKING NETWORK AVENUE WE'RE SIMILAR POSITION AS CALIFORNIA BANKERS ASSOCIATION WE APPRECIATE THE DIRECTION THE SPELLS MOVING.

IN ADDITION WITNESSES SEEN HER NUMBER ON THE BACK TO COMMITTEE ANY QUESTIONS BY THE COMMITTEE. TWO NINE ARE YES ASSISTANT. I APPRECIATE THE THE OPPOSITION ON LOOKING AT THE THE AMENDMENTS. AND I I THINK THIS IS THE RIGHT DIRECTION TO GO I I I I LIKE THE IDEA MIGHT USE A SERVED BOMB ON THE I. BANK. AND ON A IT HAS UNREALIZED POTENTIAL. AND THE THE THE DEVIL'S IN THE DETAILS SO I THINK HAVING THE TASK FORCE TO GO THROUGH A FEASIBILITY AND AND LOOK AT WHAT. WHAT THE BANK WOULD DO HOW IT WOULD OPERATE AND -- AND WHAT THE KINDA PARAMETERS WOULD BE IS IS A REALLY GOOD THING SO I'M GONNA SUPPORT THIS BECAUSE I THINK IT'S GOING IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION AND THEN. YOU KNOW HOPEFULLY IT THE LANGUAGE GETS WORKED OUT SO THAT IT IT THERE THERE CAN BE. WIDESPREAD SUPPORT. THANK YOU SENATOR RUSSELL THANK YOU AND AND THANK THE AUTHOR AND ALSO THE CHAIR FOR MOVING US IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION BECAUSE THERE'S NO DOUBT. ABOUT EVERYTHING THAT YOU SAY THE BENEFITS THAT THAT COULD COME FROM IT. I CAN ONLY IMAGINE. SOME OF THE COMPLEXITIES. THAT ARE INVOLVED IN TURNING THIS INTO. WHAT WE WOULD LIKE IT TO BE FOR THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA? I VERY MUCH BELIEVE IN OUR DOLLARS OUR TAX DOLLARS SHOULD BE USED FOR THE COMMON GOOD. AND I THINK THIS IS ANOTHER -- VERY AMBITIOUS BUT I'M SURE DOABLE EXAMPLE OF WHAT WE COULD DO HOW WE CAN INVEST OUR OWN TAX DOLLARS FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE COMMON GOOD SO THANK YOU. THANK YOU INTERESTING COMMENT. I TOO WANT TO THANK GOD THE AUTHOR OF THIS MEASURE I KNOW WE HAD A LOT OF DISCUSSION GOING BACK AND FORTH ON HOT NOT. IN SUPPORTING THE CONCEPT BECAUSE WE AGREE THAT THE CONCEPT IS GREAT BUT IN THE DETAILS OF HOW DO WE MAKE IT WORK. HOW DO WE MAKE IT WORK IN A TIME FRAME AND? INKING COMPILE SOMETHING THAT IS DELIVERABLE TO THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WE ALL CLEARLY AGREE THERE'S GREAT BENEFIT HERE. I GUESS MY ONLY QUESTION ASKING YOUR WITNESS -- WHAT DO YOU FEEL IS THE TIME FRAME THAT IT WOULD TAKE SHAPE THE STUDY COMES BACK IT SAYS A YOU CAN GO FROM THE TIME YOU COULD BE UP AND RUNNING AND AND SERVING AS A DEPOSITORY? WHAT? THE FACT THAT THE THE ALLIED BANK IS ALREADY DOING ONE HALF OF WHAT BANKS DO IT IS A GREAT INCENTIVE FOR US TO TO LOOK AT THIS -- THERE -- ENTITIES SUCH AS THE JACK HENRY -- COMPANIES THAT CAN STEP AND THAT THEY'VE BEEN DOING THIS FOR A MIDDLE MARKET AND SMALL OF BANKS FOR YEARS -- I I THINK -- ONCE IF YOU WERE ASKING ABOUT THE TIME FRAME AFTER. COMPLETION I THINK. WE THE BANK WILL BE IN A POSITION. SUBJECT TO APPROVALS -- TO START MAKING MONEY IMMEDIATELY -- THE OPERATION THE THE PAS TORY SIDE WILL. THAT WILL TAKE TWO TO THREE YEARS. IN ORDER TO GET THAT ROLLING BUT THAT CAN BE DONE -- IN A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT WAYS ONE PARTICIPATING WITH OTHER BANKS COMMUNITY BANKS -- AND AND HAVE AN ACCOUNT WITH THOSE BANKS UNDER THE NAME OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. THANK YOU. AGAIN I WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR AND IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING THAT YOU'VE -- ACCEPTED -- THE NEMATOCYSTS SCRIBED ON A PAGE -- TEN COMIC. TWELVE AND THE MIMIDS SUGGESTED WE GIVE US -- THE DETAIL WE NEED TO FIGURE OUT. WHAT WHAT WHAT IT WOULD TAKE IN TERMS OF AGAIN THE TASKS THE TIME AND MONEY TO CONVERT DIE BANK INTO A DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION? WE WILL ALSO DISCUSS ADDING THE REQUIREMENT THAT THE TASK FORCE RETURN I RECOMMENDATION WITH A WITH IT. WITH IS ABSENT WHEN IT SUBMITS ITS REPORT WHICH I'M HAPPY TO AGREE TO AS WELL SO THANK YOU FOR THAT. AND FINALLY YOU AND I HAVE DISCUSSED -- YOUR DESIRE TO SEE SOME SORT SORT OF TRIGGER ADDED TO THE BILL WHICH WOULD BE PULLED IF THE TASK FORCE. DELIVERS A POSITIVE RECOMMENDATION I SUGGEST YOU AND YOU AGREE TO ADD TO TRIGGER LANGUAGE IN THEIR PREPARATIONS COMEDIAN GIVE.

FIVE FORTY A SPLIT DOLLAR LIFE INSURANCE POLICY ALLOWS THE COST AND BENEFIT OF A PERMANENT LIFE INSURANCE POLICY TO BE SHARED. CALIFORNIA ALLOWS CALIFORNIA LAW ALLOWS NONPROFITS TO OFFER THESE UNIQUE POLICIES TO THEIR OFFICERS. AS AN ADDITIONAL BENEFIT THAT ENDS UP BEING COST NEUTRAL TO THE NON PROFIT. I'D LIKE TO ACCEPT THE SUGGESTED AMENDMENTS ON PAGE FOUR OF THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS AND THANK THE COMMITTEE STAFF FOR THEIR DILIGENT WORK ON THIS BILL. ENSURING THAT THE ARRANGEMENT IS INDEED COST NEUTRAL FOR THE NON PROFIT. CURRENT LAW REQUIRES THIS ARRANGEMENT TO HOLD BOTH THE CASH SURRENDER VALUE AND THE DEATH BENEFIT AS SECURITY. HOWEVER THIS REQUIREMENT TAKES AWAY THE BENEFIT TO THE OFFICER SINCE THEY ARE NOT. ABLE TO UTILIZE ANY OF THE CASH VALUE OF THE POLICY. SINCE IT IS REQUIRED TO BE HELD AS SECURITY FOR THE ARRANGEMENT. SENATE BILL FIVE FORTY SLIGHTLY ADJUST THE VALUE THAT IS REQUIRED TO BE HELD A SECURITY ON A SPLIT DOLLAR LIFE INSURANCE POLICY. UNDER ALONE REGIME TO EITHER THE DEATH BENEFIT OR THE CASH SURRENDER VALUE OR BOTH. THIS BILL GIVES NON PROFITS IN CALIFORNIA EVERY KRUGMAN AND RETENTION TOOL.
