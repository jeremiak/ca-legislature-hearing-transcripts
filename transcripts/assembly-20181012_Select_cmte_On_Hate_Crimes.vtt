00:13:41.153 --> 00:13:42.821
AT THE OTHER THAT WAS FOCUSED ON

00:13:43.556 --> 00:13:45.257
A RESPONSE TO THE NATIONAL

00:13:45.324 --> 00:13:47.059

ANTI BULLYING POLICY.

00:14:09.682 --> 00:14:12.818

00:14:13.485 --> 00:14:15.020
THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THAT

00:14:15.087 --> 00:14:17.056
POLICY BECAUSE WE BOTH WANTED TO

OUR OUTWARD FACING ORGANIZATION.

00:14:21.460 --> 00:14:22.928
ORGANIZATIONAL BURKE AN

00:14:22.995 --> 00:14:25.030
INDIVIDUAL WORK REALLY WAS --

00:14:25.097 --> 00:14:27.099
UNDERSTOOD TO THE PLANS OF BEING

00:14:27.166 --> 00:14:28.767
WELCOMING AND INCLUSIVE AND SO

00:14:28.834 --> 00:14:31.103
THERE'S A LOT OF WORK TO BE DONE

00:14:31.170 --> 00:14:31.737
THERE BUT I'M VERY EXCITED ABOUT

00:14:31.804 --> 00:14:32.972
THAT.

00:14:33.038 --> 00:14:33.606
AND I'LL JUST CLOSE BECAUSE I I

00:14:33.672 --> 00:14:35.241
THAT NOR STUFF GOING TO TALK

00:14:35.307 --> 00:14:35.507
ABOUT --

00:14:35.574 --> 00:14:36.141
SOME OF THE WORK THEY'RE DOING

00:14:36.208 --> 00:14:38.944
THEY'RE DOING --

00:14:39.011 --> 00:14:41.080
TO MAKE THIS OBSERVATION.

00:14:41.146 --> 00:14:45.050
I HAD NO IDEA --

00:14:45.117 --> 00:14:47.119
HOW PERVASIVE BOWLING WOULD BE

00:14:47.186 --> 00:14:49.221
WHEN I WAS A CHILD?

00:14:49.288 --> 00:14:50.990
THROUGHOUT OUR LIVES I THINK WE

00:14:51.056 --> 00:14:53.192
OFTEN THINK OF BOWLING IS

00:14:53.259 --> 00:14:53.759
SOMETHING THAT HAPPENS ON

00:14:53.826 --> 00:14:55.261
COLLEGE CAMPUSES ARE HIGH SCHOOL

00:14:55.327 --> 00:14:57.296
CAMPUSES NOT SO MUCH BECAUSE

00:14:57.363 --> 00:14:59.164
WHAT REALLY. FOR CHILDREN.

00:14:59.231 --> 00:15:01.000
AND THE TRUTH OF THE MATTER IS

00:15:01.066 --> 00:15:02.835
THAT WE HAVE A WHOLE NEW NORM.

00:15:02.901 --> 00:15:04.937
THAT'S BEING ACCEPTED AT A

00:15:05.004 --> 00:15:05.304
NATIONAL LEVEL.

00:15:05.371 --> 00:15:07.006
ANY OTHER PART OF THAT THAT SORT

00:15:07.072 --> 00:15:09.108
OF A STANDING TO ME IS THAT DAVE

00:15:09.174 --> 00:15:11.010

ORGANIZATIONS AND SENIOR HOUSING.

00:15:21.053 --> 00:15:25.057

00:15:25.124 --> 00:15:26.925
IT IS A IT'S A HUMAN DIRECTION

00:15:26.992 --> 00:15:27.593

COUPLE YEARS AGO BUT SAN JOSE

BEGINNING BORING BUT AT THE END

00:24:59.598 --> 00:25:00.799
OF HATE CRIMES.

RIGHT WITH ME.

00:25:12.911 --> 00:25:15.013
BUT BEFORE THEN.

00:25:15.080 --> 00:25:19.184
AS DISPLAYS SWASTIKA IN THEIR

00:25:29.394 --> 00:25:31.429
TO THE U. S. CONSTITUTION THAT

00:25:31.496 --> 00:25:33.265
REFERRED TO AFRICAN AMERICAN

00:25:33.331 --> 00:25:35.300
HISTORY.

00:25:35.367 --> 00:25:39.070

00:25:47.145 --> 00:25:49.080
CASE WHERE THE JURY.

00:25:49.147 --> 00:25:50.882
FOUND THESE.

00:25:50.949 --> 00:25:53.251

GUILTY OF HATE CRIMES.

00:25:56.955 --> 00:25:59.691
AND THE REASON WHY I WANNA

00:25:59.758 --> 00:26:00.091
HIGHLIGHT THAT.

00:26:00.158 --> 00:26:03.228

00:26:11.603 --> 00:26:12.837
THE MEMBERS OF THE JURY. TO

AND THAT MADE IT I THINK AN

00:26:23.715 --> 00:26:25.116
EXTRA BURDEN TO OVERCOME AND TO

00:26:25.183 --> 00:26:29.087

THING THAT WE HAVE FOUND SO

00:27:19.337 --> 00:27:22.907
IMPORTANT IS TO GO OF COURSE.

00:27:22.974 --> 00:27:23.575
EDUCATION IS AGE APPROPRIATE AND

PEOPLE IF THE GREATER NOT TOO

00:28:19.664 --> 00:28:21.199
YOUNG.

00:28:21.266 --> 00:28:22.934
TO JOIN THE CONVERSATION.

00:28:23.001 --> 00:28:27.038
AND THE STUDENT.

00:28:27.105 --> 00:28:28.807
PROGRESS IN SCHOOL THAT.

00:28:28.873 --> 00:28:29.474
MIDDLE SCHOOL AND THEN AGAIN IN

00:28:29.541 --> 00:28:31.342
HIGH SCHOOL IT'S COOL COLD BUT

00:28:37.048 --> 00:28:39.084
CONVERSATION.

00:28:39.150 --> 00:28:40.952

00:28:41.019 --> 00:28:42.987
BY THE STUDENTS THAT I WORK WITH

00:28:43.054 --> 00:28:43.254
IS THAT.

00:28:43.321 --> 00:28:45.156
HE'S.

00:28:45.223 --> 00:28:46.858
ASSEMBLY'S OR JUST AT OR

00:28:46.925 --> 00:28:49.227
INFORMATIONAL THOUGHT AS WORK

00:28:49.294 --> 00:28:51.062
MUCH BETTER WHEN THEY ARE LED BY

00:28:51.129 --> 00:28:53.098
STUDENTS THEMSELVES.

00:28:53.164 --> 00:28:55.033
UP AND I THINK THAT SOMETHING HE

00:28:55.100 --> 00:28:56.801
FOR US ALL TO REMEMBER THAT

00:28:56.868 --> 00:28:57.469
OFTENTIMES THEY DON'T WANT FROM

00:28:57.535 --> 00:29:00.905
US THEY WANT TO HEAR FROM THEIR

00:29:00.972 --> 00:29:01.206
PEAK -- IS.

00:29:01.272 --> 00:29:03.274

00:29:03.341 --> 00:29:11.082
TRAINING AND THEN HERE TO APPEAR.

00:29:11.149 --> 00:29:11.483
IN ACTION AND IT.

00:29:11.549 --> 00:29:14.953
REALLY REALLY STRONG.

00:29:15.019 --> 00:29:15.587
YOUR WERE RUNNING OUT OF TIME

00:29:15.653 --> 00:29:19.057
APPOINTED DRAFT AN ASPECT OF

00:29:19.124 --> 00:29:19.591
BULLET BEING ON CAMPUS.

00:29:19.657 --> 00:29:23.194
THAT WE HAVEN'T TALKED ABOUT YET.

00:29:23.261 --> 00:29:24.929
EDUCATION CODE ALLOWS SCHOOL

00:29:24.996 --> 00:29:27.098
SCHOOL DISTRICT TO DISCIPLINE

00:29:27.165 --> 00:29:27.732
STUDENTS ARE TO TAKE OTHER KINDS

00:29:27.799 --> 00:29:29.367
OF INTERVENTIONS WHEN THERE'S

00:29:29.434 --> 00:29:31.035
BLINKING ON CAMPUS AND I THINK

00:29:31.102 --> 00:29:31.436
IT'S NINE CENTER.

00:29:31.503 --> 00:29:33.371
WE NOT UNDERSTOOD ENOUGH.

00:29:33.438 --> 00:29:37.108
THAT EXTENDS OUT.

00:29:37.175 --> 00:29:39.377
THERE INVOLVED MEMBER SCHOOL

00:29:39.444 --> 00:29:40.812
COMMUNITY.

00:29:40.879 --> 00:29:43.214
OFF CAMPUS OR NOT WITHIN THE

00:29:43.281 --> 00:29:45.350
SCHOOL ORDERS SO IF YOU HAVE AN

00:29:45.416 --> 00:29:45.717
INCIDENT WHERE.

00:29:45.783 --> 00:29:49.120
SCHOOL STUDENTS FOR EXAMPLE.

ARE TEXT NEW CHAIR WITH IT GROUP

00:29:53.191 --> 00:29:54.926

00:29:54.993 --> 00:29:57.228
SCHOOL ALL THE PEOPLE ARE MOST

00:29:57.295 --> 00:29:59.230
OF THE PEOPLE ARE PART OF THE

00:29:59.297 --> 00:30:01.166
SCHOOL COMMUNITY THIS DOES NOT

00:30:01.232 --> 00:30:03.401
HAVE TO SAY WOW THAT DOESN'T

00:30:03.468 --> 00:30:05.136

00:30:05.203 --> 00:30:06.905
MUCH IT DOES INVOLVE.

00:30:06.971 --> 00:30:09.040
US IN THE SCHOOL IS.

00:30:09.107 --> 00:30:10.842
THE BEST PLACE I THINK.

00:30:10.909 --> 00:30:11.476
TO WORK ON COMMUNITY PROBLEMS IS

00:30:11.543 --> 00:30:13.211
THE COMMUNITY THAT'S BEING

00:30:13.278 --> 00:30:14.979
TARRED.

00:30:15.046 --> 00:30:16.881
IS PART OF THAT SCHOOL UNITY AND

00:30:16.948 --> 00:30:21.085
WE AND ARE TRINITY PROSECUTOR

00:30:21.152 --> 00:30:21.719

00:30:29.928 --> 00:30:31.429
EDUCATION CODE ALSO WHAT KIND OF

00:30:31.496 --> 00:30:33.398
INTERVENTIONS THAT ARE SO.

00:30:33.464 --> 00:30:35.099
WHAT I HAD THERE ARE IS

00:30:35.166 --> 00:30:37.202
SOMETHING THAT STUDENTS CAN BUY

00:30:37.268 --> 00:30:39.037
INTO A CAN HERE COMMUNITY WE CAN

00:30:39.103 --> 00:30:41.105
WORK ON TOGETHER?

00:30:41.172 --> 00:30:43.274
EDIT EDITION TO WORKING WITH THE

00:30:43.341 --> 00:30:45.310
STUDENTS IT ALSO VITAL BUT

00:30:45.376 --> 00:30:47.245
PROGRAMMING IS AS TARGETED

00:30:47.312 --> 00:30:48.980
TOWARD THE PARENTS.

00:30:49.047 --> 00:30:51.115
OF STUDENTS WHO ARE FULLY EIGHT

00:30:51.182 --> 00:30:53.251
AS WELL AS ARMS OF THE STUDENTS

00:30:53.318 --> 00:30:55.119
WHO ARE BULLYING STUDIES SHOW

00:30:55.186 --> 00:30:56.921
THAT.

00:30:56.988 --> 00:30:58.890
THIS THE KIDS DO NOT FALL INTO

00:30:58.957 --> 00:31:01.192
ONE CATEGORY OR THE OTHER

00:31:01.259 --> 00:31:01.492
OFTENTIMES.

00:31:01.559 --> 00:31:02.927
SINCE.

00:31:02.994 --> 00:31:04.929
HE WAS LEAD.

00:31:04.996 --> 00:31:05.563
CAN ALSO BECOME WILL LEAD OR

00:31:05.630 --> 00:31:07.565
VICE VERSA AND WHAT.

00:31:07.632 --> 00:31:09.200
AN POINT THAT I THINK IS

00:31:09.267 --> 00:31:13.171
CRITICAL TO TAKE WAY FOR DOESN'T

00:31:13.238 --> 00:31:15.373
MAKE SENSE THE CHILD --

00:31:15.440 --> 00:31:17.141
JUST GO ONLINE BECAUSE IT'S NOT

00:31:17.208 --> 00:31:21.145
REAL STUCK AND IT SEEMS SO.

00:31:21.212 --> 00:31:21.713
EASY JUST DON'T LOOK YOUR

00:31:21.779 --> 00:31:23.581
INSTAGRAM ACCOUNT OR DO TURN ON

00:31:23.648 --> 00:31:27.085
YOUR COMPUTER AND THAT IS NOT

00:31:27.151 --> 00:31:27.518
THE RIGHT ANSWER.

00:31:27.585 --> 00:31:31.089
AND THEN THE OTHER IS NOT

00:31:31.155 --> 00:31:32.957
WRITTEN TO TAKE AWAY --

00:31:33.024 --> 00:31:35.193
THAT DEVICE AS A AN ISSUE

00:31:35.260 --> 00:31:36.761
BECAUSE THAT JUST DRIVES

00:31:36.828 --> 00:31:39.330
VICTIMIZATION AND THEIR GROUND

00:31:39.397 --> 00:31:41.199
AND O'DONNELL TO WHERE YOUNG

00:31:41.266 --> 00:31:43.167
PEOPLE ARE YOU THAT AFRAID. TO

00:31:43.234 --> 00:31:45.403
COME OUT AND TELL A TEACHER OR

00:31:45.470 --> 00:31:47.005
TALK. FOR FEAR OF HAVING THEIR

00:31:47.071 --> 00:31:49.307
DEBATES TAKEN FROM THAT WHICH IS

00:31:49.374 --> 00:31:49.540
REALLY.

00:31:49.607 --> 00:31:53.278
HOUSE WITH A LIFELINE AND WAY OF

00:31:53.344 --> 00:31:58.883
PLANNER ACTION THAT IS THE NORM

00:31:58.950 --> 00:32:01.052

FORTUNATELY.

00:43:29.039 --> 00:43:34.945
WORST -- AND

00:43:35.012 --> 00:43:38.849
SOME OF THE VIEWS THAT RESONATES

00:43:38.916 --> 00:43:41.085
WITH AMERICAN VALUES OF OR YOU

00:43:41.151 --> 00:43:43.587

THE SENATE THIS.

OFF THE GOOD NEWS IS THAT NOTING

00:43:51.228 --> 00:43:53.330
A PERSON WHO IS A MUSLIM TENSED

00:43:53.397 --> 00:43:54.932
IMPROVED PERCEPTION IS ABOUT

00:43:54.999 --> 00:43:57.234
THEM AND THAT'S DOUBLY IMPORTANT

00:43:57.301 --> 00:43:57.634
TO OUGHT TO KNOW.

00:43:57.701 --> 00:43:59.269
SOURCE TO THE NEGATIVE

00:43:59.336 --> 00:43:59.770
PERCEPTIONS I WOULD SAY

00:43:59.837 --> 00:44:02.906
ISLAMOPHOBIA PROBABLY OF IS ON

00:44:02.973 --> 00:44:05.042
THE TOP THE LIST ISLAMOPHOBIA IS

00:44:05.109 --> 00:44:06.844
THE IRRATIONAL FEAR THAT THE

00:44:06.910 --> 00:44:07.144
AMERICANS.

00:44:07.211 --> 00:44:11.248
HAVE OF OF OF MUSLIMS OF AND

00:44:11.315 --> 00:44:13.517
IT'S NOT JUST HOPPING A NEGATIVE

00:44:13.584 --> 00:44:14.985
PERCEPTIONS.

00:44:15.052 --> 00:44:15.586
ON A FOUR BILLS NOW HAS BECOME

00:44:15.652 --> 00:44:17.388
AN INDUSTRY.

00:44:17.454 --> 00:44:19.256
IS A HAVE A FUNDED.

00:44:19.323 --> 00:44:21.592
OVER A HUNDRED BILLION OVER THE

00:44:21.658 --> 00:44:23.127
LAST TEN YEARS HEAVILY FUNDED TO

00:44:23.193 --> 00:44:25.496
IF YOU HAVE A HANDFUL OF A

00:44:25.562 --> 00:44:25.763
VISUALS.

00:44:25.829 --> 00:44:26.964
ARE PRODUCING VITRIOLIC

00:44:27.031 --> 00:44:29.066
INFORMATION ABOUT MUSLIMS IN A

00:44:29.133 --> 00:44:30.968
SMALL.

00:44:31.035 --> 00:44:31.568
IS BEING PUT OUT ON ON NEWS

00:44:31.635 --> 00:44:33.470
CHANNELS IS BEING PUT OUT

00:44:33.537 --> 00:44:35.005
THROUGH A POLITICIAN'S THROUGH

00:44:35.072 --> 00:44:37.141
PUNDITS.

00:44:37.207 --> 00:44:37.708
THROUGH BOOKS THAT ARE BEING

00:44:37.775 --> 00:44:38.208
WRITTEN ABOUT MUSCLE.

00:44:38.275 --> 00:44:39.410
AND I THINK THAT THAT'S PROBABLY

00:44:39.476 --> 00:44:41.445
THE THE BIGGEST SOURCE OF

00:44:41.512 --> 00:44:43.080
ISLAMOPHOBIA.

00:44:43.147 --> 00:44:47.151
IRRATIONAL FEAR THAT MANY

00:44:47.217 --> 00:44:49.119
AMERICANS HAVE IMMIGRATION

00:44:49.186 --> 00:44:51.588
RESULT AS YOU MIGHT IMAGINE IS

00:44:51.655 --> 00:44:52.956
OF COURSE HARASSMENT AND

00:44:53.023 --> 00:44:55.392
BULLYING OF MY CHILDREN.

00:44:55.459 --> 00:44:57.561
IN THE COUNCIL ON AMERICAN

00:45:03.233 --> 00:45:05.369
SOME AMERICAN STUDENTS --

00:45:05.436 --> 00:45:09.139
EXPERIENCE OF OF BULLY

00:45:09.206 --> 00:45:10.908
EXTENSIVELY ONE OUT OF TWO OF

00:45:10.974 --> 00:45:16.880
MUSLIMS IN CHILDREN AND THIS

00:45:16.947 --> 00:45:19.016
BUILDING IN SCHOOLS IN.

00:45:19.083 --> 00:45:22.786
HARASSMENT ENTITIES OR IN --

00:45:22.853 --> 00:45:23.454
IN SOME FORM AND IT'S AND WORSE

00:45:23.520 --> 00:45:25.556
UP SINCE THE LAST PRESIDENTIAL

00:45:25.622 --> 00:45:26.857

00:45:26.924 --> 00:45:29.026
ANOTHER UP AND THAT'S WHEN

00:45:29.093 --> 00:45:29.693
CONSEQUENCE OF THE POLITICAL AND

00:45:29.760 --> 00:45:31.495
WHEN IT IS A FEELING ASHAMED AND

00:45:31.562 --> 00:45:33.163
CURRENT EVENT DISCUSSIONS.

00:45:33.230 --> 00:45:35.566
UP IN WHICH IS WHICH IS GETTING

00:45:35.632 --> 00:45:37.334
OUT FIRST THAT WAY THAT THAT

00:45:37.401 --> 00:45:39.636
THAT FEATURE FRAME CONVERSATION.

00:45:39.703 --> 00:45:43.474
OF IN IN THE FRAME OF US FOR

00:45:43.540 --> 00:45:45.309
THAT.

00:45:45.375 --> 00:45:47.411
THE MOST ARE USED VIEWED AS THE

00:45:47.478 --> 00:45:49.213
ENEMY.

00:45:49.279 --> 00:45:49.680
OF DISABILITY LACKING

00:45:49.746 --> 00:45:51.281
SENSITIVITY TOWARDS THE FACT

00:45:51.348 --> 00:45:51.982
THAT MANY OF THESE KIDS ACT HAVE

00:45:52.049 --> 00:45:53.550
RELATIVES OF THE PALM TREES AT

00:45:53.617 --> 00:45:53.750
THAT.

00:45:53.817 --> 00:45:55.352
ARE THE TEACHERS ARE TALKING

00:45:55.419 --> 00:45:57.154
ABOUT.

00:45:57.221 --> 00:45:59.523
THEN ALL POINTING TO BUT MOST

00:45:59.590 --> 00:46:01.191
KEVIN ASKING THEM TO BE BOMB THE

00:46:01.258 --> 00:46:03.494
EXPERTS ON SOD ON THESE ISSUES.

00:46:03.560 --> 00:46:07.064

00:46:11.201 --> 00:46:13.036
IT BECOMES EVEN ARE BECOMES EVEN

00:46:13.103 --> 00:46:13.270
WORSE.

00:46:13.337 --> 00:46:17.274
I DO FOLKS ON THE REMEDIES HOW

BULLYING OF SOME SORT.

00:46:19.776 --> 00:46:21.545
INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT EFFORTS TO

00:46:21.612 --> 00:46:25.349
FOCUS ON EFFECT I THINK 8090% OF

00:46:25.415 --> 00:46:27.084
OUR APPROACH BE ON THE IN THE

00:46:27.151 --> 00:46:27.317

WITH THE COMMUNITY IN ADDITION

00:46:40.931 --> 00:46:41.465
TO WHAT HE RECOMMENDED I THINK

00:46:41.532 --> 00:46:43.100
THAT IT'S ALSO.

00:46:43.167 --> 00:46:45.169

OF THAT A TEACHER MIGHT MIGHT

00:47:34.851 --> 00:47:34.985
