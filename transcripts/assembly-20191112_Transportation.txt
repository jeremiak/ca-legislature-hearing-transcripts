SEGMENT FROM SAN FRANCISCO TO BAKERSFIELD TO A SHORTER BUILDING BLOCK HIGH SPEED RAIL LINE FROM WORST TO BAKERSFIELD. THE AUTHORITY ESTIMATES THIS SO CALLED CENTRAL VALLEY LINE WALK EIGHTEEN POINT THREE BILL DOLLARS TO BUILD MONEY THE RAIL AUTHORITY ALREADY HAS IN HAND AND WILL BE OPERATIONAL BY TWENTY TWENTY EIGHT. AS WE ALL KNOW IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHT THE VOTERS APPROVED PROPOSITION ONE A. TO PROVIDE NINE BILLION IN BONDS TO HELP BUILD A FIVE HUNDRED MILE LONG HIGH SPEED RAIL SYSTEM FROM SAN FRANCISCO TO LOS ANGELES. AT THAT TIME THE ESTIMATE FOR THE FULL COST OF THE PROJECT WAS FORTY FIVE BILLION AND WAS TO BE COMPLETED BY TWENTY TWENTY. PROPOSITION ONE A PRESCRIBE SPECIFIC. AND DESIGN REQUIREMENTS FOR THE HIGH SPEED RAIL SYSTEM INCLUDING THAT IT MUST BE ELECTRIFIED. BE CAPABLE OF SO STATUS BEATS OF NO LESS THAN TWO HUNDRED MILES PER HOUR AND HAVE THE CAPACITY TO TRAVEL. TO ACHIEVE TRAVEL TIMES BETWEEN SAN FRANCISCO LOS ANGELES OF TWO HOURS AND FORTY MINUTES. SINCE THAT TIME WE HAVE SEEN NUMEROUS VERY PATIENTS ON WHERE THE RAIL LINE WOULD BE BUILT AND WHEN WE COULD EXPECT A COMPLETED SYSTEM. ALTHOUGH THE GOVERNOR REMAINS COMMITTED TO BUILDING THE FULL SYSTEM HE STATES THAT IS NEW PLAN. IS ABOUT WHAT THE STATE CAN DO WITH THE RESOURCES THAT WE HAVE. TODAY'S HEARING IS ABOUT GETTING A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF THE AUTHORITIES PLAN INCLUDING ALL OF ITS MISSING PIECES. THE RISKS. THAT ARE INVOLVED IN THE TRADE OFFS THAT MUST BE MADE. AND OPINIONS OF EXPERTS OUTSIDE THE DIRECT FEAR OF THE AUTHORITIES INFLUENCE. SO THAT WE THE LEGISLATURE CAN MAKE INFORMED DECISIONS ABOUT THE FUTURE OF THIS PROJECT. WE WILL HEAR TODAY FROM VICE CHAIR OF THE AUTHORITY BOARD OF DIRECTORS TOM RICHARDS AS WELL AS DIRECTOR BRIAN KELLY. WE ALSO HEAR FROM DANNY CURTAIN ONE OF THE ASSEMBLY IS APPOINTEES TO THE AUTHORITY BOARD. MARK EVANS CEO OF THE EARLY TRAIN OPERATORS HERE TO PRESENT SOME OF HIS FINDINGS TO THIS COMMITTEE AND WE WILL HEAR FROM THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE AND THE HIGH SPEED RAIL PEER REVIEW GROUP. TO PROVIDE EXPERT ANALYSIS OF THE PROJECT. FINALLY WE WILL HEAR FROM REPRESENTATIVES OF OUR REGIONAL PARTNERS WITHOUT WHOM HIGH SPEED RAIL SIMPLY COULD NOT WORK. MEMBERS AS CHAIR FRAZIER HAS SAID BEFORE PROCEEDING WITH THIS PROJECT WILL NOT BE FOR THE FAINT OF HEART SO LET'S GO INTO IT FULLY INFORMED AND WITH A CLEAR UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT IT WILL TAKE. I'D LIKE TO NOW ASK ASSEMBLY MEMBER FONG IF YOU'D LIKE TO MAKE SOME COMMENTS. UGH I THANK YOU VERY MUCH I APPRECIATE EVERYONE BEING HERE- THE- SECRET THAT I AM A SKEPTIC OF THIS PROJECT- AND CERTAINLY THE CHALLENGES THAT LIE AHEAD OF US IN THE USE OF TAXPAYER DOLLARS. I WAS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT TO ME. AS WE MOVE FORWARD HOW WE HAVE A DECEMBER TWENTY TWENTY DEADLINE- THAT- NEED TO BE MET BEFORE FEDERAL FUNDS- MAYBE CALL BACK. IN SO I WOULD BE OBLIGATED. SO HOW DOES THAT HIGH SPEED RAIL AUTHORITY- SEEK TO EVEN ATTEMPT TO. REACH THAT MILESTONE SO- I HAVE A LOT OF. QUESTIONS I THINK STILL THAT LEFT TO BE LEFT TO BE UNANSWERED BUT LOOK FOR TO- TO THE QUESTIONS AND THE ANSWERS FROM- FROM FROM NICE TO AUTHORITY THANK YOU MUCH. THANK YOU MISTER FONG ASSEMBLY MEMBER IN ANY OPENING COMMENTS. SURE JUST BRIEFLY I'M LAURA FRIEDMAN I REPRESENT A DISTRICT THAT INCLUDES BURBANK IN THE BURBANK AIRPORT WHICH IS A LOCATION THAT'S IMPORTANT TO THE FUTURE OF THIS PROJECT- SHOULD IT MAKE IT THAT FAR- IT'S INTENDED TO BE POSSIBLY THE MAIN HIGH SPEED RAIL- TERMINAL FOR THE LOS ANGELES AREA. I'D ALSO COULD PART OF WHAT'S CONSIDERED THE BOOK AND PROJECTS IN LOS ANGELES THAT RECEIVED SOME FUNDING THROUGH HIGH SPEED RAIL BEING THE ROOTS OF THAT RIGHT NOW OUR METRO ROUTES BETWEEN BURBANK AT ANAHEIM- I LIVE IN AN AREA THAT IS VERY HEAVILY IMPACTED BY TRAFFIC CONGESTION. I'M BY AIR QUALITY ISSUES AS AREA IT'S AS WELL. I CONSIDER MYSELF TO BE A VERY STRONG ADVOCATE FOR MASS TRANSIT AND ALTERNATIVE TRANSPORTATION TWO CARS ARE SO I'M VERY INTERESTED IN TRAINS IN GENERAL AND USE AND EXPANDING OUR RAIL LINE WHETHER IT'S- WITH LIGHT READ RAIL AND SUBWAYS ARE THAT TYPE OF REAL AND URBAN AREAS BUT ALSO BEING THE- A CLEANER AND MORE CONVENIENT AND SAFER ALTERNATIVE FOR PEOPLE TO GO FROM POPULATION CENTERS OF POPULATION CENTER ACROSS CALIFORNIA. OF MY QUESTIONS ARE GOING TO BE AROUND HOW THIS PROJECT FITS INTO OF FITS INTO THAT- HOW OLD THIS PROJECT TO HELP REDUCE CONGESTION ACROSS THE STATE AN AIR QUALITY AND THAT IF WE DO GO FOR WHAT THIS PROJECT TO KNOW WHEN WE GO FORWARD. HOW TO BEST UTILIZE DOLLARS TO GET PEOPLE OUT OF THEIR CARS ACROSS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND MAKE SURE THAT WE GIVE PEOPLE A MORE CONVENIENT. ALTERNATIVE TO DRIVING AROUND THE STATE SO THAT'S WHERE MY FOCUS IS GOING TO BE AND I'M REALLY HAPPY TO SEE SUCH A BIG TURNOUT I'M VERY INTERESTED IN HEARING FROM THE EXPERTS I'VE ONLY BEEN IN THE LEGISLATURE FOR THREE YEARS SO THIS IS A RELATIVELY. NEW TO ME- AS YOU KNOW THE ONE WHO'S ASKED TO BE A POLICYMAKER AND I KNOW A LOT OF YOU WHO. ARE HERE TODAY TO SPEAK HAVE MANY MANY YEARS WITH THIS PROJECT. AND OTHERS SO I'M INTERESTED IN HEARING FROM ALL OF THE STAKEHOLDERS AND ALL OF THE EXPERTS I WANT TO THANK. MY COLLEAGUES FOR BEING HERE AND ALSO- TRANSPORTATION CHAIR JIM FRAZIER FOR CONVENING THIS MEETING. EVEN THOUGH HE'S NOT ABLE TO BE WITH US HERE TODAY HERE WITH US IN SPIRIT. THANK YOU.

FEEL FREE TO INTERRUPT AND ENGAGE OUR PANELISTS AS NEEDED I WANT US TO GET TO THE HEART OF THINGS TODAY AS MUCH AS WE CAN. AND FOR THE PUBLIC THERE WILL BE AMPLE TIME TO HEAR FROM THE FOLLOWING PANELS. BECAUSE I SUSPECT MANY OF YOU WILL WANT TO. SPEAK I'D ASK YOU TO MAKE YOUR COMMENTS COMPLETE BUT SUCCINCT. AND TO THE EXTENT YOU CAN HELP US FOCUS ON THE SPECIFIC SPECIFIC ITEMS WE WILL BE DISCUSSING TO PAY. THAT WOULD BE APPRECIATED. WITH THAT LET'S BEGIN TODAY'S HEARING. DIRECTOR KEVIN. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS I'M BRIAN KELLY AND THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER THE HIGH SPEED RAIL AUTHORITY. HERE FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. OF MY COMMITTEE VICE CHAIRMAN TOM RICHARDS IS IN ROUTE. APOLOGIZES HERE YET BUT HE IS AN- IN ROUTE TO THIS HEARING HE MAY. ALSO APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO ADDRESS. THE COMMITTEE WHEN HE GETS HERE- I ALSO WANT TO THANK THE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE FOR COMING DOWN. I KNOW HOW BUSY IT IS WHEN YOU'RE LEGISLATOR. AND THAT'S TAKES TIME OUT OF YOUR SCHEDULE TO COME HERE. TO OUR THE PROJECT TODAY SEE WHAT WE'RE BUILDING IN THE VALLEY- IT'S GREATLY APPRECIATED IT SO THANK. YOU VERY MUCH FOR TAKING THE TIME. TO COME DOWN HERE. I THINK THE BIGGEST CHANGE WE MADE- SINCE I TOOK OVER AS THE CEO OF THIS- AUTHORITY IN. FEBRUARY OF TWENTY EIGHTEEN WAS REALLY IN THE MIDST OF THE- ANNOUNCEMENT OF. A COST AND SCHEDULE ISSUES ON THE PROJECT AND TO ME THAT WAS THE- BEGINNING POINT OF US SAYING LET'S TAKE A NEW LOOK. AT HOW WE WILL FOR THIS PROJECT AND SO. FIVE IN THE MIDST OF THAT- ASSESSING. WHAT WE SEE OUR REVENUES- IS BEING OVER THE COURSE OF THE NEXT. TEN YEARS OR SO WITH THE CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM GOING UP TILL- TWENTY THIRTY- AND OUR BOND DOLLARS ARE STILL AVAILABLE TO THIS- PROGRAM UNDER PROPOSITION ONE A- THE WORKING CLOSELY WITH THE ADMINISTRATION ON OUR BOARD- WE MOVE MOVE TOWARD A FLAT. FEE OF DOING THIS LIKE YOU BUILD MANY. TRANSIT PROJECT IN THE STATE AND THAT IF YOU DON'T HAVE ALL THE FUNDING YOU NEED. IN HAND TO BUILD EVERYTHING. YOU BUILD ANOTHER BUILDING BLOCK APPROACH. AND THAT'S BEEN THE OF PRINCIPLES YOU FORTY SINCE BEFORE I GOT HERE- BUT REALLY WITH THE- THE- ACOSTA SCHEDULE ISSUES. THAT EMERGED ADJUST WHEN I STARTED ON THIS PROJECT. THAT WE SHOULD STARTED. EARLY INTERMONTANE EXCITEMENT WHEN WE CAN- IN THE VALLEY- AND THEN WORK TOWARD EXPANDING THAT- THAT PROGRAM FURTHER BEFORE I GO ANY FURTHER. LET ME TO MY BOARD VICE CHAIR RICHARDS AND I THINK BEFORE I SAY MUCH ELSE LET ME DEFER TO HIM. TO ADDRESS THE COMMITTEE. YEAH. THE FIRST PAULA JUDGE I WAS WAITING FOR YOUR LETTER THANK. APOLOGIZE FOR THAT. LET ME A WELCOME YOU HERE MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE- MY NAME IS TOM RICHARDS I'M THE ONE WHO'S LIKE TODAY MY NAME IN DHAKA. AS YOU MAY KNOW- OR CHAIR WHICH HERE MOST OF LAST WEEK- LEADING THE CALIFORNIA ECONOMIC SUMMIT. IF YOU ALSO KNOW EARLIER THIS YEAR THE- GOVERNOR INTRODUCED HIS ADMINISTRATION'S- THOUGHTS WITH REGARDS TO THIS PROJECT- WHICH INCLUDED A BILL BOB BLOCK APPROACH. THE APPROACH IS TO GET HIGH SPEED RAIL OPERATING ON SHORTER SERVICE IS EARLY AS POSSIBLE AND DISCUSSED BAKERSFIELD MERCED. EXCUSE ME. I IN MAY- OUR MANAGEMENT AT HIGH SPEED RAIL PUT PRODUCED- FOR YOU IT'S A BI ANNUAL. PROJECT UPDATE REPORT. THAT WAS ON MAY THE FIRST AND IN THAT REPORT I ENDORSE THE IDEA OF A BUILDING BLOCK APPROACH AND SPECIFICALLY DISCUSSED THE BENEFITS OF THE BAKERSFIELD MERCED EARLY SERVICE SEGMENT. LATER THIS SPRING. IN NOW JUNE THE FINANCE AND AUDIT COMMITTEE OF WHICH I CHAIR ALONG WITH TWO MEMBERS OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS WHICH IN WHO INCLUDED ERNIE CAMACHO FROM SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA AND NANCY MILLER FROM NORTHERN CALIFORNIA. TASK OUR FINANCIAL ADVISORS FORTY KPMG TO PRODUCE A BUSINESS CASE REPORT. FOR THE BAKERSFIELD MERCED SEGMENT. AND TO IN THAT REPORT TO ADDRESS THE BENEFITS AND THE OTHER. IF YOU SURROUND AN EARLY SERVICE BETWEEN BAKERSFIELD MERCED LATER THAT DAY THE DIRECTOR CAMACHO. HEY INTRODUCED EIGHT AN ACTION OR MOTION WITH THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS THE PURPOSE OF WHICH WAS TO TASK THE EARLY TRAIN OPERATOR. TO LOOK INTO A COMPLETE SIDE BY SIDE STUDY OF OPTIONS OF EARLY SERVICE IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA CENTRAL CALIFORNIA IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. BOTH OF THESE STUDIES ARE UNDER WAY THEIR COMPLEXES SIGNAGE. AND WE BELIEVE HER I BELIEVE AT LEAST THAT THEY WILL FORM THE BASIS FOR THE TWENTY TWENTY A BUSINESS PLAN. I WOULD LIKE AT ALSO AND I BELIEVE YOU'RE WELL AWARE THIS THAT IT IS A BORED EXISTING. ACTION I IN APPROVAL OF THE TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN BUSINESS PLAN. THAT IT INDOORS THE INITIAL OPERATING SEGMENT BETWEEN BAKERSFIELD AND SECOND VALLEY SLASH BAY AREA. OTHER AREAS OF ONGOING FOCUS FOR OUR BOARD- OUR COMPLIANCE WITH THE FEDERAL GRANTS THAT WE HAVE WHICH REQUIRES YOU KNOW COMPLETION BY DECEMBER THIRTY FIRST TWENTY TWO. THE ACCELERATION OF CONSTRUCTION ACTIVITIES ROW ACQUISITION THIRD PARTY AGREEMENT ENVIRONMENTAL CLEARANCE AND COMPLIANCE WITH THE TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN STATE AUDITOR'S REPORT. THESE ARE THE ACTIONS ARE THE ACTIVITIES THAT ARE BORDER ACTIVELY INVOLVED WITH AND CONCERNED ABOUT I WANTED TO ADDRESS THOSE WITH YOU BRIEFLY AND THEN TURN OVER THE BALANCE OF THE PRESENTATION ON THE PROJECT UPDATE TO SCO KELLY RIGHT. THANK YOU TOM. WELL I THINK I'LL JUST MOVED OUT TO EXPEDITE THINGS HERE TO A PRESENTATION THAT WE PREPARE FOR THIS COMMITTEE- HOPEFULLY THIS WILL MOVE ALONG AS I CLICK THESE BUTTONS YES I'M SO THIS IS INTENDED TO JUST SORT OF GIVE YOU A STATUS CHECK OF WHERE WE ARE RIGHT NOW IN THE PROJECT IN TERMS OF OUR A GLOBAL GOALS AND OBJECTIVES- AND ALSO TO GIVE YOU A SENSE OF THE STATUS OF ELECTRIFIED HIGH SPEED RAIL IN CALIFORNIA TODAY. SO THE FIRST IMPORTANT POINT FOR US IS WHAT WE START WITH AT THE AUTHORITY WE START WITH OUR MISSION AND OUR MISSION IS CLEARLY FIND THE LAW. ARE MISSED IS BUILT. UP HI SIR. YOU KNOW WHAT. IN A NON CAPABLE OF SYSTEM SPEAKS OF TWO HUNDRED MILES PER HOUR OR GREATER AND THE STAFF IN THE BOB BILL THREE IN OTHER LESSONS OF LAW AND WHEN WE TALK ABOUT NOW IT IS ROLL STOCK THE WE ALWAYS DRIVING BOARD THAT IT GIVES YOU BUILDING BY THE- SYSTEM THAT MEETS THOSE SPEEDS AND THAT'S AN IMPORTANT OBJECTIVE BECAUSE IN CALIFORNIA TODAY IF YOU GET ON CONVENTIONAL RAIL FROM THE LA BASIN IN THE TROUT TRAVEL TO THE SAN FRANCISCO BAY AREA. THAT'S A TWELVE OR THIRTEEN HOUR TRIP. IN IN TWENTY TWENTY OR TWENTY NINETEEN THAT'S A BIT. WE WANT TO GET THAT TRIP DONE IN UNDER THREE HOURS AND WE THINK WE CAN'T- SO THAT IS THE MISSION OF THE VOTER CENTERS ON AND THAT IS THAT IS HOW WE MOVE NOW THEY- STATED EARLIER. WE DON'T HAVE ALL THE FUNDS IN HAND AND WE NEVER HAVE. TO BILL ALL OF THAT SYSTEM WE'VE NEVER HAD ALL THE MONEY WE NEED TO BUILD IT ALL SO THE APPROACH IS TO BUILD IT IN BUILDING BLOCKS- WHICH IS. TRADITIONALLY HOW YOU BILL TRANSIT SYSTEMS UP AND DOWN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA ACROSS THE COUNTRY. THERE ARE THREE PRINCIPLES THAT HAVE GUIDED THE BOARD'S DECISIONS IN HOW WE MOVE FORWARD IN A CONSTRAINED FUNDING ENVIRONMENT FIRST. INITIATE HIGH SPEED RAIL SERVICE IN CALIFORNIA. AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. MAKE STRATEGIC CONCURRENT INVESTMENTS THAT WILL BE LINKED OVER TIME AND PROVIDE MOBILITY. ECONOMIC AND ENVIRONMENTAL BENEFITS AT THE EARLIEST POSSIBLE TIME. AND POSITION OURSELVES TO CONSTRUCT A DIVISIONAL SEGMENTS. AS FUNDING BECOMES AVAILABLE. NOW WE ARE MOVING FORWARD. MOST DON'T APPRECIATE TOWARD THE TO THE JACKET. AND THE SHOW THAT. HERE. INTO THE STATUS OF THE PROJECT. IS IT YES THE GREEK. SEGMENT ON THIS OR ARE WE PROJECT BERMAN. STATE HUNDRED TWENTY ONE MILES REP ANTS. NINE OF THOSE. EARLY UNDER STRUCTURE JUST LAST WEEK WE AS WE PLEADED FARM WORK THE DOW DOWN BAKERSFIELD. THE TEXAN BAR MIDDLE DOCUMENT THAT WE WILL BE EXTENT. INSTEAD IS A THE FIFTY MILE. A RAILING. SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA REGION WE HAVE A NEW PLAYER REAL AN ENEMY. THERE IS A CHANGE IN CALIFORNIA I WHICH- I LIKE WELL IN THE LAWSUIT IT WAS. INTO THE REGION A LINE. TO VICTOR THAT IS UP AN EIGHTY MILE STRETCH IN A HUNDRED MILES THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. THIS PROJECT. MATIC ENGINE IT BROUGHT TO LIFE. FIRST IS MANAGED NO NO. IT IS NOT OPEN ON OPERATE BY ENTITIES. ARE VERY REPUTABLE THE TRAIN STATION LINE IS ALL. TODAY AN URGENT IS THE SITE COMPANY. VIRGIN IS COURSE THE RICH. NUMBER ONE SPOKE TO ME SO THE PLAYERS IN THE TRANSFER SINCE. YEAH THAT PROJECT. SENIORS WHAT TAKING A MINUTE. THE SERVER TO HIGH SPEED UP TO FIVE. SO THEY ARE BATTLING THE TO FIVE LINE. WHILE THE FOR THAT PROJECT THE MONEY COMING INTO THE BILL FOR THE CATHOLICS BUT THERE'S IS ME FROM THE EVIDENCE. THIS IS TRULY A PUBLIC PRIVATE SHIP. AND THREE IS THIS PUBLIC THE PARTNERSHIP THE FIRST IS- THEY HAVE SOUGHT FROM OUR TAX CREDIT ALLOCATION COMMITTEE WITH THE STATE OF ACCESS TO LOW COST CAPITAL AND IT'S NOT THE SAME THROUGH OUR INFRASTRUCTURE BOND BANK AND THEY HAVE BEEN APPROVED AT BOTH LEVELS- TO MOVE FORWARD- WITH ACCESS TO LOW LOW COUNTS ARE TAX EXEMPT. BONDING AUTHORITY WHICH LOWERS ACOSTA CAPITAL SO THAT'S OCCURRED THE HIGH SPEED RAIL AUTHORITY ITSELF IN THE STATE TRANSPORTATION AGENCY HAS ENTERED AN AMMO YOU- WITH VIRGIN TRAINS WERE WE WILL DISCUSS OF THINGS LIKE RESERVATIONS TICKETING- THE QUICK MEANT INTEROP ABILITY OF THINGS WE CAN DO TO MAKE SURE WE CAN SHARE EACH OTHER'S LINES. REALLY PERHAPS PROVIDE INFRASTRUCTURE WE CAN BOTH RIGHT ON- IN SO THAT IS THAT IS AN IMPORTANT ELEMENT- TOWARD THAT AND- YOU AND LASTLY AND MOST IMPORTANTLY FOR THE PROJECT THE SECRETARY THE STATE TRANSPORTATION AGENCY. HAS TO PROVIDE THE RIGHT AWAY. TO CONSTRUCT THAT PROJECT THAT PROJECT AND I'M VERY JEALOUS OF THIS POINT HAD PROJECT IS BEING CONSTRUCTED ON ALMOST ENTIRELY PUBLIC RIGHT OF WAY. OWNED BY THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IN THE DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION. AND SO- THAT IS AN ELEMENT- WHERE THE STATUS PARTNERING ALL OF THOSE FRONTS TO MOVE THAT THAT PROJECT FORD SO IN THIS PICTURE HERE. THE GREEN IS WERE RENDER PROJECT DEVELOPMENT THE DOTTED LINES ARE WHERE WE ARE STILL WORKING THROUGH OUR TERMINAL SAYS. EVERYONE KNOWS THE TERMINAL PROCESS IS COMPLETE. THIS BUT THINGS LOOK WHAT EIGHTEEN TO TWENTY FOUR MONTHS. EIGHTEEN TO TWENTY FOUR MONTHS COULD BE UNDER CONSTRUCTION. ALL THESE SEGMENTS VIRGIN AND THE SECOND IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA THE HIGH SEVENTY MILES IN THE ALLEY FIFTY MILES. IF YOU OWN WAY. ONE IS OF IS ONE SYSTEM. WOULD HAVE JUST AS WELL PHONE ON THE OF MILES YOUR CONSTRUCTION DARK ONE NOW THE COMPLETED LOOK THAT WERE DONE BEFORE. REPRESENTS THE PATIENT ALL THE YOU MENTAL. THIS IS SO WHAT THIS MEANS NEXT TWENTY MONTHS RETURN FIFTY MILES OF ELECTRIC AND ICE ROLLER STRUCK. FOR YOU ALL THE ENVIRONMENTAL. ALL OF HIS WORK BETWEEN INFERENCE GO A LOT ANGELS CANNOT BECOME. OUR FUNDING PARTNERS ALL OVER THE STATE TODAY NOT JUST IN OUR INVESTMENTS IN THE VALLEY BUT ALL OVER THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA WERE IN FOR ABOUT ONE POINT THREE BILLION NOW INCLUDING FOR FORTY ONE MILLION FOR THE LOS. ANGELES UNION STATION. TAKING GREAT. WHEN THE BENEFITS OR CAUGHT A HOT GRILL WHEN YOU GET THERE. OF THE PAINS. THE FREE WILL TO THAT MISSION. I READ ALL IN FULL PROVIDE. THEY'RE **** THE TWO HUNDRED SIXTY THREE MILLION DOLLARS ALL OF THE ENVIRONMENT WORK ON YOUR DOOR. THEY'RE BUILT. UP A BANK. ALL OF THE WORK DOWN ALSO. US MET LOPES ON OTHERS FIND OUT HOW TO WORK. THEN A WORK THAT SEGMENT- WE MADE THE SEVEN BILLION THE FIRST OF THE HARD AT WHAT TIME THE HIGHEST RATE PUBLIC SAFETY TURN PROGRESS DEBORAH PROJECT CALIFORNIA. HAD RUN RENTS. AND IN LOS ANGELES. BIGGEST CHUNK OF THAT IS SEVEN HUNDRED FOURTEEN MILLION DOLLARS THERE WE ARE COMMITTING IN BOTH PROP ONE A BOND FUNDS AND CAP AND TRADE DOLLARS TO ELECTRIFY. THE CALTRAIN PROJECT BETWEEN SENTENCES. FRANCISCO YOU'RE DOING I'D BE ONE WILL PROVIDE EARLY IF IT'S TOO EARLY TO IMPROVEMENTS. AND OPERATE REMOVED. AN UPDATE WITH A TICKET RANGE AND THIS ALL TO ME THE COURT THAT WE SHARE WHEN WE. AND UNLIKE THE WORK FOR. DURING THE QUARTER WELL SIMILARLY THIS UP HELLO. TWO NINE THREE DOLLARS BERMAN IF YOU WERE. BETWEEN TELLS A PERCENT. GO IN AS A THAT IS A WAY DRAFT MILK I COMMENCED. TWENTY TWENTY WE'LL BE TO THE FINAL ENVIRONMENTAL DIE. TWENTY TWENTY ONE THIS. EIGHTY FOUR MILLION DOLLARS OF BAD TO THE SALMON GRADES RATIONS. IN A I READ PUBLIC SAFETY. LIKE THE WE ARE FUNDING RESULT A COLD OR IN THE MORNING WHAT WAS YOUR- THREE DOLLARS PROBLEM A FOUR. CAN I TAKE PRIDE. NORTHERN CALIFORNIA HERE IS WHAT SO. BRING FOR ONE POINT. AND THEN FINALLY THIS IS OUR SCHEDULE ON THE ENVIRONMENTAL DOCUMENTS UP AS YOU SEE ON THE LEFT COLUMN IS ARE PROJECTS SEGMENT. AS I MEANT EARLIER. EAST BOUND AS WELL WE'VE COMPLETED OUR WORK COME FROM. IN CLOSELY WITH A DIFFERENT ACCOUNT KERN WHAT THAT MIGHT MEAN LOOK LIKE IT WAS THIS WOMAN. AND WE COMPLETE THAT WORK AT THE LAST DAY OF OCTOBER SIGN UP. IN THE WORLD WELL I GUESS THAT. THESE ARE ALL LIST IN ORDER IS YOU CAN BE THIS VALLEY BY THE MERCED PATCHES. BIG BILL THE PALMDALE THANKS A BUNDLE BURBANK AND IS IT SAID. FINALLY LOS ANGELES I'M AS YOU CAN SEE IT IS THAT ON ALL OF THE DROP IN BAR DOC WILL BE BASED IN TWENTY WORK FINAL AS THE GETTING A DATE OF CERTIFICATION OF THAT WELL THE MAN BY THE. THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE. ASCOM IS A PORTENT. JUST RELATIVES FEDERAL. THIS WORK MUST BE DONE. FUNDING I AGREEMENT THE END NEEDS TO AND NOT LAST REFLECT THE AMOUNT OF BLOAT YOU WILL BE OUT OF WORK NUMBER OF MONTHS HAVE. THAT WILL GROW. I HAD A GOOD WE ARE TERMS. BUT ON THE WIND IN CALL THREE THAT SOME MONTHS HAVE. FRONT OF THE RULES GET. I'LL SAY IT HEARING A MATT. WE WILL HAVE CHALLENGES THIS IS A MEGA INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECT OF THE OTHER ONE PRIOR TO THIS AND ON THE MOST FAMILIAR WITH HIS WORK WHEN I WAS THE SECRETARY OF A TRANSPORTATION OVER THE BAY BRIDGE THE SAN FRANCISCO BAY AREA AREA. AND MEGA PROJECTS HAVE CHALLENGES OUR OBJECTIVE IN OUR DUTY IS TO BE VERY CLEAR ON WHAT THOSE CHALLENGES ARE AND TELL YOU WHAT OPPORTUNITIES WE HAVE AND HOW WE CAN ADDRESS THOSE CHALLENGES. A TO MOVE FORWARD IN SO- THAT'S KIND OF A HIGH LEVEL SUMMARY WHERE THINGS STAND TODAY AND WITHOUT A MAP TO CONCLUDED OPEN TO QUESTIONS THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN. THANK YOU DIRECTOR KELLY AND VICE CHAIR RICHARDS IF I CAN I'D LIKE TO START WITH QUESTIONS AND PASS IT OFF TO ASSEMBLYMEMBER FRIEDMAN. I'D LIKE TO ASK WHAT DO WE EXPECT TO SEE IN THE TWENTY TWENTY BUSINESS PLAN. I THINK IN THE TWENTY TWENTY BUSINESS PLAN- SOME OF WHAT YOU SAY WHAT YOU WILL SEE IS WHAT- BOARD MEMBER RICHARDS INDICATED- WE HAVE. A COUPLE OF REPORTS THE WE ARE WROTE WORKING THROUGH RIGHT NOW- I THINK THOSE ARE GOING TO DRIVE SOME OF OUR DETERMINATIONS IN THE TWENTY TWENTY BUSINESS PLAN- I THINK YOU WILL SEE US DRIVING FORD ON- GETTING THE WORK DONE IN THE VALLEY- AND- A PLAN IN PROGRAM. IS A SORT OF INDICATED IN THIS. POWER POINT PRESENTATION TO COMPLETE ALL OF THE WORK- THAT WE HAVE TO GET DONE TO MEET OUR TWENTY TWENTY TWO OR A GRANT REQUIREMENTS FIRST. AS OUR HIGHEST PRIORITY. THEN SECONDLY MOVING TO AN INTERIM OPERABILITY SEGMENT. AND THEN THIRD COMPLETING ALL THE ENVIRONMENTAL WORK SO WE CAN. OF FOCUS AND WORK ON. OF ON CLOSING THE GAPS BETWEEN THE VALLEY IN THE BAY AREA IN THE VALLEY OF LOS ANGELES. GOING FORWARD SO I THINK. YOU'LL SEE THAT LAID OUT I GUESS THE- ONE OF THE THING I'D SAY I WOULD LIKE US IN THE BUSINESS PLAN AND THIS IS. A SOMETHING WE STOP THE WORK TO OUR BOARD OF COURSE- BUT TO HAVE THREE D. DISTINCT RAVAGES OUTLINED IN THAT PLAN FOR THE VARIOUS REGIONS. AND AGAIN I THINK WITH THE EMERGENCE OF VIRGIN TRAINS AND SO CALIFORNIA. THERE'S INTERESTING OPPORTUNITY THERE- AND THERE'S ADDITIONAL OPPORTUNITY THE BAY AREA WITH THINGS THAT THEY'RE LOOKING AT REGIONALLY SO. I THINK YOU'LL SEE HERE'S WHAT WE INTEND TO DO IN THE SHORT TERM WITH THE MONEY WE HAVE. AND HERE'S OUR LONGER TERM GOALS- TO EXTEND ELECTRIFIED HIGH SPEED RAIL IN CALIFORNIA. CAN YOU COMMENT ON THE- THE MO YOU. AND THAT WAS RECENTLY ATTAINED AND HOW THAT HELPS THE AUTHORITY YES THANK YOU. IN JULY OF THIS YEAR- THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT GRANTED US SOMETHING CALLED NEPA ASSIGNMENT OF FORTY OF FOR THOSE OF YOU BEEN IN TRANSPORTATION FOR SOME TIME- THIS IS THE AUTHORITY TO DO THE FEDERAL ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW WORK- CONCURRENTLY WITH THE STATE ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW WORK INSTEAD OF IT BEING TWO DISTINCT. SEPARATE PROCESSES ONE DONE HERE AND ONE DONE IN WASHINGTON DC YOU HAVE TO DO ABOVE BUT THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY TO STREAMLINE THE PROCESS AND WORK THROUGH THEM BOTH TOGETHER. SO NATIONALLY- ABOUT FIVE OR SIX DIFFERENT STATES HAVE BEEN DOING THAT ON THE HIGHWAY SIDE CALIFORNIA IS ONE OF THEM IN CALIFORNIA HAS DONE VERY WELL IN TERMS OF SAVING TIME AND MONEY TO THAT PROCESS WE HAVE NOW BECOME WITH THE GRANTING OF THIS. PROPOSAL WE ORIGINALLY ASKED FOR EIGHTEEN MONTHS AGO- BUT IT WAS GRANTED IN JULY OF THIS YEAR FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND WE ARE NOW THE FIRST RAIL PROJECT IN THE NATION- TO GET ME ASSIGNMENT WHAT IT MEANS FOR US IS- I EXPECTED IT MEANS WE WILL MOVE MORE QUICKLY- THROUGH THE FEDERAL PART OF THE ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW PROCESS. AGAIN WE HAVE TO DO ALL OF THE THINGS THAT NEED TO BE DONE WE NEED TO MAINTAIN A VERY GOOD WORKING RELATIONSHIP WITH OUR FEDERAL PARTNERS BECAUSE THEY MAINTAIN SOME ROLE IN CONTINUED REVIEWS- AND APPROVALS BUT RATHER THAN SENDING EVERY DOCUMENT BACK TO WASHINGTON DC AND WAITING FOR A RESPONSE. A WE CAN NOW WALK ACROSS THE HALLWAY AND HAVE OUR FIRE WALLED THE DEBATE TEAM DO THAT WORK IN APPROVED THESE DOCUMENTS SO WE DO EXPECTED TO STATE SAVE TIME WE DO X. EXPECTED SAVE MONEY. AND CANDIDLY THE FIRST ENVIRONMENTAL DOCUMENT THAT WE CLEARED THE ROD TO BAKERSFIELD- WAS THE FIRST ONE WE DONE UNDER THAT NEED ASSIGNMENT. IT'S ENCOURAGING TO HEAR WAYS IN WHICH WE CAN BECOME MORE EFFICIENT TENDS TO BECOME QUICKER AND SO- I'D LIKE TO ASK NOW ABOUT THE NECESSARY SPEND RATES TO MEET THE F. R. A. GRANT REQUIREMENTS AND- WHAT IS OUR CURRENT SPEND RIGHT. MISTER CHAIRMAN I DIDN'T I DON'T HAVE IN FRONT OF ME THE EXACT- SPEND RATE THAT WE HAVE ON THE- PROJECT RIGHT NOW BUT I CAN TELL YOU THAT. WE ARE REPORTING QUARTERLY ON WHERE WE ARE IN TERMS OF OUR EXPENDITURE RATE- AND MEETING THE- THE ARE A GRANT AGREEMENT THE BIGGEST CHALLENGE WE HAVE HAD. IS THAT IN THE VALLEY AND THIS IS LARGELY BECAUSE- WE COMMENCE CONSTRUCTION PRIOR TO HAVING ALL THE RIGHT AWAY AND HAND HERE- IN ALL THE UTILITY RELOCATIONS IDENTIFIED AND MOVED- THAT HAS BEEN THE SORT OF FIRST ORDER WORK THAT WE ARE STILL GRINDING THROW. A HOWEVER WE ARE IMPROVING THAT SYSTEM WE STREAMLINED SOME OF THAT RIGHT AWAY- THAT- RIGHT AWAY PROCESS. A GOING FORWARD SO THINGS LIKE LAND CONVEYANCES AND SOME OF THE- ACQUISITIONS WE CAN DO IN A QUICKER PACE- SO WE'VE BEGUN THAT PROCESS. NOW IN IN THAT WORK IS GOING FORWARD ARE SPEND RATE IS CLIMBING- I THINK THIS MONTH I WAS JUST TOLD THE WILL BE SPENDING. A JUST UNDER FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS THIS MONTH- ON THE CONSTRUCTION HERE IN THE VALLEY- AND SO- WE CONTINUE TO JUST- GROWING THROUGH THE- THE PROCESS HERE. AND ARE LOOKING TO. IS MY CHIEF OPERATING OFFICER LIKES TO SAY. A CONSTRUCTION LINE IS AN S. SHAPED FIGURE AND YOU GO TO THE FIRST ORDER ORDER OF WORK. AND IT'S PRETTY FLAT BUT ONCE YOU GET THAT DONE. YOU GOT YOUR SPEND RATE JUMPS UP PRETTY QUICKLY IS YOUR NOW ROLLING THROUGH CONSTRUCTION. SO AS WE COMPLETE THAT FIRST ORDER WORK I EXPECT OUR SPEND RATE WILL CONTINUE TO INCREASE- WE DO REPORT THIS QUARTERLY TO THE LEGISLATURE- NOW INTO OUR PER HOUR PERIOD YOU GROUP. I JUST DON'T HAVE THE DATA AND FOR ME THE MOMENTS I APOLOGIZE NO IT'S OKAY- IF I MAY I'D LIKE TO CHANGE GEARS AND ASK ABOUT SB ONE. WHETHER OR NOT IT- PEOPLE TO FIND RAIL IMPROVEMENTS. AND HOW MUCH MONEY FOR EXAMPLE HIGH SPEED RAIL HAS RECEIVED FROM THE PASSAGE OF SB ONE. SB ONE- DOES PROVIDE DOLLARS FOR RAIL. IMPROVEMENTS BUT IT DOESN'T PROVIDE ANY DOLLARS FOR HIGH SPEED RAIL. THERE'S A PROGRAM THERE ARE SEVERAL PROGRAMS BY WHICH IS B. ONE CAN FIND. A RAIL IMPROVEMENT THE- PRIMARY ONE IS CALLED THE TRANSIT CAPITAL AND INTERCITY RAIL IMPROVEMENT PROGRAM- AND THAT FUNDS. A LOT OF COMMUTE COMMUTER RAIL A PROJECTS HOWEVER WE ARE NOT- ELIGIBLE TO PARTICIPATE IN THAT FUND AND SO OUT OF SB ONE WE HAVE BEEN WILL RECEIVE NO NO FUNDING. HAS THE SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA JUST AS AN EXAMPLE RECEIVED ANY MONEY FOR RAIL- IN THAT REGION TO THE SP ONE. YES. AGAIN MOSTLY THE I'M MOST FAMILIAR WITH THE T. I. R. C. P. PROGRAM AND THROUGH THAT PROGRAM I THINK SINCE THE BEGINNING OF THAT PROGRAM INCLUDING SB ONE DOLLARS AND THAT REGION IS RECEIVED ON THE WATER OF TWO POINT SEVEN TWO POINT SIX TWO POINT SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS. WITH THAT I WILL CONCLUDE MY QUESTIONS AND HANDED OVER TO ASSEMBLYMEMBER FRIEDMAN. THANK YOU AND THANK YOU MISTER KELLY MISTER RICHARDS FOR- BEING HERE AND SPEAKING WITH US TODAY I HAVE A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS- MY FOR IS IT ONE OF PART OF THE GOVERNOR'S VISION OF HOW THIS PROJECTS GOING TO ROLL OUT AND WHY- WE SHOULD BE. INVESTING IN THIS SECTION OF PROJECT IS TO DEMONSTRATE BY ABILITY. AND TO HOPEFULLY ATTRACT PRIVATE INVESTMENT TO HELP COMPLETE THE REST OF THE SYSTEM AND I'M WONDERING WHAT YOU SEE AS THE SORT OF THRESHOLD THAT WOULD DEMONSTRATE THAT- AND WHETHER YOU'VE HAD ANY INTEREST FROM PRIVATE INVESTMENT AT THIS POINT SORT OF WHAT WOULD IT TAKE TO TOLD THAT BALANCE. THIS THAT AND SO WHERE WHERE IS THEIR LEVEL IF YOU GO FROM ONE TO TEN WHERE IS PRIVATE INVESTMENT NOW ON THIS. ON HELPING TO COMPLETE THE ENTIRE PROJECT AND WHAT WOULD IT TAKE TO GET THEM UP TO TWO TEN THEY'RE KINDA IN. I THINK IDEALLY FOR PRIVATE INVESTMENT IN THAT THIS PROJECT THEY WOULD WANT TO SEE A DEMONSTRATION THAT- YOU CAN RUN A FOR PROFIT SERVICES ACTUALLY THAT YOUR NET REVENUES WILL EXCEED YOUR NET COST- IN OUR VALLEY THE VALLEY APPROACH FROM BAKERSFIELD TO SAN FRANCISCO WE- WE SEE WE PROPOSE THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO. TO DO THAT- SO THE DISCONNECTION NOTICE RIGHT CLOSE TO DEMONSTRATE THAT SO HOW DO YOU DO THAT IN THIS SECTION THIS SECTION WILL NOT DEMONSTRATE THAT WITH THIS SECTION WILL DO OTHER THINGS THAT ARE IMPORTANT- THIS SECTION FOR US- WILSHIRE THE ASSETS THAT WE ARE SPENDING BILLIONS TO BUILDING THIS PART OF THE STATE WILL NOT GO TO WASTE. WE'LL PUT TO USE IT WILL BE PUT TO USE FOR ELECTRIFIED HIGH SPEED RAIL CONSISTENT WITH OUR MISSION UNDER THE LAW IN SO AND IT WILL REDUCE TRAVEL TIMES TO CLEAN UP THE AIR- AND WILL PROVIDE A BETTER TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM IN AN AREA OF THE STATE THAT HAS LITTLE PUBLIC TRANSIT- AND SO THAT IS. WHY WE WANT TO START THERE AGAIN WE ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THE- SORT OF BREAK POINT ON THE OPERATIONS VERSUS COST STRETCH IS. LIKELY BAKERSFIELD ALL THE WAY THE BAY TO SAN FRANCISCO. WE DON'T HAVE ALL THE MONEY WE NEED TO BUILD THAT STRETCH YET IT'S STILL OUR OBJECTIVE- BUT WE'RE GOING TO FINISH THAT ENVIRONMENTAL WORK AND THAT'S THE OTHER. POINT I WANT TO MAKE. TO REALLY GET ENVIRONMENTAL INTERESTS- IN THESE TYPES OF MAKE A PROJECTS MISSED THAT THIS TYPE OF PROJECT. YOU HAVE TO REDUCE RISKS OR THEY WILL NOT PLAY. IN EYES SO I THINK THE WAY YOU DO THAT IS YOU GET THE ENVIRONMENTAL WORK DONE. IN SO WHEN I TALK ABOUT GETTING ALL OF OUR ENVIRONMENTAL WORK DONE IN THE NEXT. EIGHTEEN TO TWENTY FOUR MONTHS. TO ME THAT AS A PRECURSOR TO REALLY. INVITING A LOT OF PRIVATE SECTOR OPPORTUNITY ON THIS PROJECT IN TERMS OF MEETING. HELPING ME CAPITAL COSTS. BUT THE OTHER THING I MUST SAY BECAUSE ITS THE NEWEST AND MOST EXCITING. DEVELOPMENT ON THIS PROJECT FOR THE FIRST TIME. PRIVATE SECTOR INTERESTED DEMONSTRATED WITH THE VIRGIN TRAIN SYSTEM IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. AGAIN THEY'RE TAKING THE RISK ON. THE FIRST SEGMENT OF THAT AGAIN A BUILDING BLOCK APPROACH. LAS VEGAS TO VICTORVILLE. AND THEY ALL TO MILLIE ARE GOING TO NEED HELP TO GET THE PALMDALE. BUT I KNOW I'VE TALKED WITH. THEY HAVE NO INTENTION OF HAVING A LAS VEGAS RUN BE. LAS VEGAS TO VICTOR. THEY WANNA GET TO PALMDALE AND THEY WANT TO GET TO LOS ANGELES. AND THEY WANT TO DO IT ON SHARED. ASSETS THAT WE BOTH HAVE. A BECAUSE THAT'S HOW YOU DO IT UNDER THE QUICKEST. TRAVEL TIME POSSIBLE. IN SO- CLEARING THAT ENVIRONMENTAL WORK. ENTERING IN M. WITH THEM ON HOW WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO PROCEED TOGETHER. IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA TO CLOSE THAT LOOP I THINK. OF THOSE ARE IMPORTANT STEPS IN FRONT OF US BUT IN ESSENCE I GUESS WHAT I'M SAYING IS. TO ATTRACT PRIVATE SECTOR INVESTMENT. YOU NEED TO REDUCE RISK. AND WHEN WE DO THAT IS GET ALL THE ENVIRONMENTAL WORK DONE. AND THEN SECONDLY- YOU WANT TO DEMONSTRATE THE VIABILITY OF THE PROGRAM. SO IT'S THAT SECOND PART THAT I'M ASKING ABOUT YEAH AS I UNDERSTAND. THAT THERE'S A PROPOSITION AND THERE'S FUNDING AND- YOU HAVE TO SPEND IT. AND I UNDERSTAND THE PART ABOUT. DOING THE ENVIRONMENTAL WORK SO THAT YOU REDUCE THAT RISK AND YOU GET READY TO. LAY YOUR- PROJECT OUT- IT'S THE BUILDING BLOCK PART THAT I'M TRYING TO UNDERSTAND THE LINK BETWEEN THIS PARTICULAR BUILDING BLOCK. AND THEN TRADING BY ABILITY. SO WHAT IS IT THAT YOU WANT TO SEE. OUT OF THIS IN TERMS OF SORT OF INCREASE RIDERSHIP. AND HOW DOES THIS. INTO THAT TO REALLY DEMONSTRATE THAT I ABILITY BECAUSE I AGREE WITH YOU I THINK THAT DEMONSTRATING THAT PEOPLE. ARE WILLING TO TAKE TRAINS. IS VERY IMPORTANT TO GETTING THE INTEREST FOR THE SYSTEM WIDE HIGH SPEED RAIL. BUT WHY IS THIS SECTION AND THE INVESTMENT IN THIS SECTION GOING TO DEMONSTRATE THAT IS SUPPOSED TO. AND INVESTMENT THAT WE MIGHT HAVE HAD IN ANOTHER SECTION BECAUSE THERE'S NO OTHER SECTION IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WILL WE CAN REMOVE TRAIN TO TWO HUNDRED MILES PER HOUR. ELECTRIFIED SO WITH THAT AND WHAT WHEN WHY I THINK THAT IS IMPORTANT. IS BECAUSE THAT IS WHERE YOU GET THE TIME SAVINGS THAT YOU CAN PRESENT WITH THIS KIND OF A SYSTEM SO LET'S TALK ABOUT THAT. SO NOW I TO I UNDERSTAND THE TIME SAVINGS. FROM BAKERSFIELD TO MERCED. IT'S A BIG DISTANCE. AND YOU'RE GONNA HAVE A MUCH FASTER TRAIN. BUT LET'S SAY YOU'RE YOU'RE IN FRESNO YOU'RE RIGHT HERE IN FRESNO. AND YOU WANT TO GO TO THE BAY AREA. AND MY UNDERSTANDING FROM SPEAKING TO YOU EARLIER IS THAT IT'S YOUR HOPE THAT ONCE THE SECTION IS COMPLETED. THE AMTRAK TRAIN THAT RIGHT NOW IS REDUNDANT WITH THAT ROUTE. THAT YOU'LL HAVE LESS OF THOSE AMTRAK TRAINS. WILL INSTEAD BE TAKING THE HIGH SPEED RAIL. SO FROM FRESNO. GO TO MERCED WHICH IS ONE STOP. AND THEN YOU CHANGE TRAINS. AND THEN YOU CONTINUE TO THE BAY AREA OR TO SACRAMENTO ON WHEREVER YOU'RE GOING. NOW IT SEEMS TO ME THAT YOUR TIME SAVING THAT POINT BECOMES ESSENTIALLY A WASH. BECAUSE I DON'T SEE HOW YOU GET PEOPLE OFF THE TRAIN AND BACK ON THE OTHER TRAIN WITH THEIR BAGGAGE AND STROLLERS. I DON'T KNOW FIFTEEN TWENTY MINUTES. I TAKE THE TRAIN A LOT I HAVE TO CHANGE TRAINS AT UNION STATION ALL THE TIME AND YOU'RE TALKING JUST METRO TO METRO OR AMTRAK TO METRO. THAT AMTRAK TRAINS IS THERE FOR QUITE AWHILE AND THAT'S BEST CASE SCENARIO THAT YOU ARRIVE ON HIGH SPEED RAIL AND YOU'VE GOT THE AMTRAK TRAIN. WAITING READY TO GO THEY'VE PUT THE FOOD ON IT THEIR GEAR THEY'RE READY TO GO YOU'RE STILL TALKING AT LEAST FIFTEEN MINUTES TO GET PEOPLE FROM ONE THE OTHER MAYBE TWENTY MINUTES. SO FOR FRESNO GROUP WHO GETS ON IN FRESNO. IT DOESN'T SEEM THAT YOU'RE OFFERING THEM ANY TIME SAVING BUT YOU ARE ASKING THEM TO CHANGE TRAINS NOW IN THE MIDDLE I THINK THEY'LL HAVE MORE THAN ONE OPTION MY SENSE OF IT IS ELEVEN OPTIONS THE UNCONVENTIONAL RAIL. IN SICKENING GO FROM FRESNO TO OAKLAND OR PRESENT TO SACRAMENTO UNDER THAT AMOUNT OF TIME IT TAKES TO TRAVEL ON THAT TODAY BUT YOU SAID THEY WERE GOING TO BE REDUCING THAT YES SEVEN TO NINE TRIPS A DAY TO TREAT THEIR WILL WELL. AS I SAID EARLIER SUBJECT TO AN OPERATING GREEN WE HAVE NOT YET COMPLETED. WITH OUR LOCAL PARTNERS BUT HERE'S HERE'S A WE'RE INTENDING TO DO. RIGHT NOW IN MERCED THERE'S AN AMTRAK STATION ONE LOCATION AND NO A STATION AT ALL. THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THE LEGISLATURE INVESTED EIGHT HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IN GETTING H. TO MERCED. INCREASING THE NUMBER OF TRIPS AND AMTRAK TAKE INTO MERCED WE ARE PROPOSING TO DO IS HAVE THE AMTRAK STATION THE MERCED STATION IN THE HIGH SPEED. SORRY THE AMTRAK STATION. ACE STATION AND THE HIGH SPEED RAIL STATION ALL GO TO ONE PLACE IN MERCED. AND THEN TRANSFERS AND THINGS LIKE THAT WILL BE SIMPLER I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE TRAVEL TIME IS FROM FRESNO TO MERCED BECAUSE WE HAVEN'T ITEM MODEL THAT. WHAT I HAVE MODELED IS MERCED TO BAKERSFIELD IN THE NINETEEN. HUNDRED MINUTE REDUCTION VERSUS TRAVEL TIME TODAY. SO YES IF THEY CHOOSE HIGH SPEED RAIL THE GET TO MERCED QUICKER THAN THEY WOULD ON THE CONVENTIONAL RAIL. ACROSS THE PLATFORM. GET ON AMTRAK IF THEY WANT TO TAKE ACTION FOR ACE. IN GETTING EITHER THE BAY AREA OR SACRAMENTO. AS I. AS AN INTERIM MEASURE FOR AND BY THE WAY I'M NOT ASKING YOU THESE QUESTIONS TO BE ARGUMENTATIVE. OR TO SAY THAT THERE'S ANYTHING. NECESSARILY WRONG ABOUT THE APPROACH BUT I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ALL UNDERSTAND WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THAT AS WE MAKE THESE INVESTMENTS. WE ALL UNDERSTAND THIS SO THAT WERE ABLE TO MAKE CHOICES WITH OUR FUNDING. THAT MAKE IT YOU KNOW GET MY GOAL IS I WANT TO GET PEOPLE ON THESE TRAINS WHATEVER TRAINS THEY ARE. ONE OF ON THE TRAINS AND I WANT TO MAKE SURE WE UNDERSTAND. WHAT THE EXPERIENCE IS GOING TO BE FOR THEM BECAUSE I'M FROM A REGION WHERE A LOT SOMETIMES. USE THE PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION IS NOT GOING IN THE DIRECTION WOULD LIKE GOING DOWN NOT UP. AND AS SOMEBODY WHO. YOU KNOW I GAVE UP MY CAR FOR TWO YEARS AND JUST RODE BUSES AND TRAINS. THAT EXPERIENCE THAT USERS HAVE THAT'S VERY IMPORTANT. IF YOU REALLY WANT TO ENCOURAGE THEM TO USE YOUR SYSTEM SO I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE I'M NOT TRYING TO ARGUE WITH YOU I WANT TO. UNDERSTAND WHAT THE EXPERIENCE IS GOING TO BE. FOR THOSE WRITERS- SO LET ME ASK A LITTLE BIT OF JUST. I'M SORRY THIS WILL BE SORT OF MY LAST LINE OF QUESTIONING AYE AYE. YOU KNOW YOU'RE YOU'RE- A NEWER EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR I WANT TO ASK YOU A LITTLE BIT ABOUT SOME OF THE OLD PRACTICE OF- HIGH SPEED RAIL. BECAUSE BEFORE I WAS IT ON IN THE ASSEMBLY I WAS A COMMISSIONER AT THE BURBANK AIRPORT. AND HAD THE EXPERIENCE OF. BEING MY BEING A COMMISSIONER THERE AND- DEALING WITH AN AIRPORT TRYING TO BUILD A NEW TERMINAL FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO DON'T KNOW FLYING TO BURBANK HOPEFULLY IN A FEW YEARS YOU WILL HAVE A- MUCH SAFER. NICER NEW TERMINAL THERE. AND IT'S BEEN A VERY LONG MAYBE TWENTY YEAR PROCESS OF BURBANK TRYING TO. GET PERMISSION TO BUILD THIS. VERY IMPORTANT TERMINAL FOR SAFETY EVERYTHING ELSE. AND IT INVOLVES SELLING A VERY LARGE PIECE OF PROPERTY THAT WERE AT THE AIRPORT OWNED. AND IT WAS A LOT OF MOVING PIECES THAT WERE BEING PUT TOGETHER THAT WAS THE- OF MANY YEARS. AND WEBER WE WERE VERY CLOSE TO THE END. OF GETTING OUR PERMISSIONS AND SELLING OUR PROPERTY HIGH SPEED RAIL. AUTHORITY AT THE TIME SORT OF SHOWED UP OUT OF THE BLUE. AND AT A PUBLIC MEETING ASKS US TO STOP THE SALE OF THE PROPERTY. TO CHANGE DIRECTIONS TO MAYBE NOT BUILD THE TERMINAL RIGHT AWAY. YOU KNOW. VERY SURPRISING BEHAVIOR. FROM AN AGENT FROM AGENCY TO AGENCY SO MY AND I'VE HAD A SIMILAR EXPERIENCE WHEN I WAS ON THE GLENDALE CITY COUNCIL OF HIGH SPEED RAIL TELLING US THAT THEIR- TRAIN WAS GOING. THROUGH HERE AND LOOKING AT THE MAP AND SAYING THAT'S- THE DISNEY CAMPUS SUCH GOOD REMARKS CAMPUS THAT'S UP HIS STORE STORE TRAIN STATION ON THE HISTORIC REGISTER LIKE. WHERE ARE YOU WITH AND A LOT OF YOUR ISSUES COMING THROUGH LOS ANGELES. THE ISSUE A VERY DENSE AREA WITH A LOT OF DISRUPTION. BUT THE SECONDARY ISSUE THAT IS DEALING WITH A MULTITUDE OF CITY COUNCILS AND NEIGHBORHOOD COUNCILS. AND EVERYBODY KIND OF BEING ON BOARD AND UNDERSTANDING WHAT HAS TO HAPPEN. SO WHERE ARE YOU WITH COMMUNICATIONS AND HAVING A BETTER WAY TO UNDERSTAND WHAT THE NEEDS ARE AS YOU GO INTO A DENSE AREAS. AND COMMUNICATING. MAYBE BETTER THAN THE PREVIOUS REGIME. WITH ALL OF THE DIFFERENT AGENCIES AND CITIES YOU HAVE TO DEAL WITH IT HOW DO YOU MANAGE THAT SO THAT YOU DON'T HAVE TREMENDOUS FIGHTS WHEN YOU GO TO THE SAN FERNANDO VALLEY. BUT YOU DON'T. TELL SMALL CITY LIKE CITY OF SAN PRINT THAT THEY'RE GONNA LOSE THEIR ENTIRE DOWNTOWN. THE HIGH SPEED RAIL HOW DO YOU WORK AROUND THAT. LIMITS PER SE I APPRECIATE THE QUESTION ALSO APPRECIATE YOUR POINT ABOUT- THIS IS A LARGE- STRATEGY OF GETTING PEOPLE. TO USE BOTH HIGH SPEED RAIL AND CONVENTIONAL RAILS. THE REASONABLE TO WORDS. AVAILABLE I THINK I'M SO PASSIONATE ABOUT THIS PROJECT BECAUSE IT'S- IT. IT IS THE MOST TRANSFORMATIVE PROJECT I'VE SEEN IN TWENTY FIVE YEARS OF WORKING IN TRANSPORTATION AND I THINK THE IDEA. OF CONNECTING CITIES OF CALIFORNIA. THROUGH ELECTRIFIED HIGH SPEED RAIL WILL ENHANCE LOCAL AND REGIONAL TRANSIT SERVICES WELL. SO I AM A PASSIONATE ABOUT THAT ON TO YOUR SECOND. QUESTION STRICTLY ON THE BURBANK EXAMPLE. ONE OF THINGS THAT I'VE TRIED TO DO SINCE I'VE BEEN HERE IS WORK TOWARD BEING MORE SPECIFIC AND CLEAR ABOUT WHAT WE'RE DOING- AND- THAT MANIFESTS ITSELF IN A COUPLE OF WAYS FOR A LONG TIME BEFORE I GOT HERE. THE AUTHORITY HAD NOT- QUITE YET EVEN ADOPTED THIS PREFERRED ALTERNATIVES FOR SOME OF ITS- WORDS INTENDING TO GO IN SO IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN WE COMPLETED THE PREFERRED ALTERNATIVES FOR THE SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA AREA. IN IN THE BAY AREA WE COMPLETED THAT JUST A COUPLE OF MONTHS AGO- BUT DOING THAT HELPS THAT ENHANCE THE COMMUNITY CONVERSATION. BECAUSE IT DID NOW ATTENDS THE FOCUS ON WHERE WE INTEND TO GO AS A PREFERRED ALTERNATIVE. AND IT HELPS AS A WORK THROUGH WITH THE CITY'S MORE SPECIFIC ISSUES A CITY OR COUNTY LOCAL PARTNERS MORE SPECIFIC ISSUES. THERE ON THE TABLE RIGHT AFTER WE ARE PREFERRED ALTERNATIVE I FLEW DOWN AND SPOKE WITH THE BURBANK AIRPORT- I'VE GOT A MEETING THIS WEEK WITH THE CITY OF BURBANK. A TO TALK MORE ABOUT THIS- ONE HANDICAP I CURRENTLY HAVE IN THE SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA REGION IS OF WE'RE IN THE MIDDLE OF A CHANGING OUT OUR REGION DIRECTORS WHO WILL BE PART OF OUR LEAD COMMUNICATION DOWN THERE. BUT THAT SAID WE HAVE CANDIDATES WERE INTERVIEWING NOW AND WILL BE REPLACING THAT AS WELL. THE OTHER PRODUCTS THAT IS JUST PART OF THIS IS THAT WE ARE SITTING AND LISTENING- IT ON THE FRONT END OF THINGS AND NOT WAITING TILL THE END- DIRECT. WE HAVE SOME IN A PROBLEM IN TWO EXAMPLES I'D GIVE YOU A THAT ARE. IN OUR STRETCH BETWEEN BAKERSFIELD IN PALMDALE- THERE'S THE SHOP AS MEMORIAL A MONUMENT THAT IS UP IN THE TO HATCH PEAS AND THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF CONSTERNATION IS A BACK AND FORTH ABOUT- WHERE AND HOW THE TRAIN WILL GET AROUND. THAT SEGMENT WE DECIDED DELAYED THINGS FOR SIX MONTHS DOES HAVE CONSECRATED COOPER STATION WITH THAT ENTITY TO WORK THROUGH HOW WE WILL DO THAT. AND I THINK WE'VE MADE SIGNIFICANT. PROGRESS THE- US POLITICAL FOR THE. THE SECOND. OTHER ISSUE THAT WE WORK THROUGH WITH THE- ARMY CORPS OF ENGINEERS CAUGHT A PLACE CALLED. THE LAKE WITH HOW WE WILL GET THROUGH THE LAKE. RATHER THAN JUST MARCHING FORWARD NOT LISTENING IN HAVING A FIGHT AT THE END. BUT WE'RE ENGAGING EARLIER AND HAVING THESE CONVERSATIONS- ON THE FRONT END IN TRYING TO WORK THROUGH THESE ISSUES SO. PART OF IT IS TAKING THE TIME EARLIER FIRST OF ALL IT'S- BEING MORE SPECIFIC CLEAR. ABOUT WHAT OUR INTENTIONS ARE- IN IN THE END. UP TAKING THE TIME TO HAVE THE CONVERSATIONS. TO LISTEN TO THE COMMUNITIES AND FIGURE OUT WHERE WE DISAGREE. AND THEN WORK TOWARD UP SOME KIND OF A SOLUTION. AND SO. THAT'S THE APPROACH I'VE TRIED TO I'VE TRIED TO BRING TO THIS SINCE I'VE BEEN HERE. I THINK IT'S THE APPROACH THAT MY BOARD INSISTS ON- IN TERMS OF HAVING A BETTER- OUTREACH EFFORT AND COMMUNITY- RESPONSE EFFORT- IN SO THAT. IN SHORT THAT'S WHAT I'M WHAT I TRY TO DO. IT IN- AS THANK YOU AND I'VE HAD THIS CONVERSATION BEFORE BUT YOU KNOW CERTAINLY WHEN IT COMES TO BURBANK AIRPORT- IT'S A MAJOR TRANSPORTATION HUB. BEING MAJOR REGIONAL AIRPORT. THERE'S ALSO TWO METROLINK TRAINS TO BUILDING A TERMINAL. AT SOME POINT YOU MAY BE BUILDING A TERMINAL THERE AS WELL AND IT WOULD JUST BE GREAT IF FOR PASSENGERS THEY HAVE A SEAMLESS EXPERIENCE FROM ONE OF THESE TRAVEL MODALITIES TOGETHER. I DON'T SEE THAT PLANNING HAPPENING QUITE HONESTLY I SEE THEM BUILDING A TERMINAL. WITHOUT ANY THOUGHT TO HOW IT CONNECTS WITH WHATEVER IF YOU'RE GONNA BUILD A TERMINAL. I KNOW IT'S FAR FROM THE FUTURE MAYBE IT HAPPENS MAYBE IT DOESN'T BUT I STILL DON'T SEE THAT KIND OF COORDINATION AND- THERE'S A LOT OF. APPOINTING OF THAT OTHER COUNTRIES AND THEIR EXPERIENCE WITH HIGH SPEED RAIL AND I DON'T SEE THE SAME ATTEMPT TO TIE. AIRPORT TO HIGH SPEED RAIL. THE WAY THAT WE'VE SEEN IT WORK EFFECTIVELY IN OTHER PLACES I STILL HAVE THE SORT OF NIGHTMARE. THAT THEY'RE GOING TO BUILD THEIR TERMINAL. ONE DAY YOU COME IN YOU BUILD YOUR TERMINAL AND PEOPLE HAVE TO WALK A HALF MILE TO GET FROM ONE TO THE OTHER OR SOMEBODY HAS TO BUILD SOME EXPENSIVE. THING TO BRING THEM BACK AND FORTH- AND I JUST HOPE THAT AS WE THINK ABOUT. REGIONAL TRANSPORTATION HUBS THAT WE REALLY THINK OF IT THAT WAY AND GET OUT OF OUR SILOS AND WORK. TEMPTED AND WORK. IT FROM THE- VIEWPOINT OF A USER AND A GOOD USER EXPERIENCE AND HAVING SOMETHING THAT IS. A PLANNED IN ADVANCE SO THAT WE DON'T HAVE THE ADDITIONAL EXPENSE OF HAVING TO GO BACK AND RETROFIT AND BUILD TRAINS TO AIRPORTS LIKE WE'RE DOING IT LA ACTS AND- EVERYTHING ELSE- THE ONE WE JUST SAY THAT- RIGHT NOW I'M IT'S SORT OF THE MID POINT OF CONVERSATIONS WITH- THE BURBANK AIRPORT. THE CITY OF BURBANK IN THE FAA. ON EXACTLY HOW WE'D COME IN THERE AND WHEN AND- EVERYBODY'S GOT THEIR OWN ENVIRONMENTAL DOCUMENT- SO WE'RE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO MAKE THAT WORK- BUT- EVEN THE LEAD AT THE BURBANK AIRPORT SAID TO ME IN OUR MOST RECENT MEETING- HOW IMPORTANT WAS THAT- WE'RE MAKING A VERY EASIER FOR THE PASSENGERS TO YOU. KNOW GET THERE AND GET- FROM A TRAIN STATION TO THE TERMINAL- TOLD MILLIE FLY IN SO. OF A GUY CLEARLY- THAT'S SOMETHING WE WANT TO GET TO. THE QUESTION IS INTERESTS OR GETS TO A PROCESS ISSUE. HOW YOU DO IT THE BASS WHILE HAVING EVERYBODY MOVE. ON THE ENVIRONMENT REVIEW PROCESS AND SO THAT'S- CONVERSATIONS WERE ENGAGED IN. IN REAL TIME RIGHT NOW. AND I'M HAPPY TO MEET WITH YOU ON THAT GOING FOR IF I MAY JUST FOR ONE MOMENT. THE MAN I AM AWARE OF WHAT YOU WERE TALKING SO OUT EARLIER. WITH BURBANK THE INTENTION. WAS ISSUED TO THE ISSUE. MORE OR LESS TO FIND OUT WE WORK TOGETHER. AND GENERATE A TRANSPORTATION HUB THAT WAS REALLY IMPORTANT TO US. AND CLEARLY IMPORTANT TO BURBANK. THE CHALLENGE WAS A MESSAGE ON OUR SIDE WAS REALLY NOT VERY CLEAR. AND CERTAINLY MISHANDLED- I THINK THAT IS SOMETHING THAT- OVER THE YEARS WE'VE LEARNED A LOT ABOUT A INTERACTION WITH. THOSE P. IT WITH THOSE SAID STAKEHOLDERS THAT WE ARE WORKING WITH IN AROUND- THAT WAS A VERY UNFORTUNATE BECAUSE I REALLY DID SEE THE OPPORTUNITY. WITH WHAT WE COULD HAVE DONE TOGETHER WITH BURBANK AT THAT POINT. WELL AGAIN I'M NOT TRYING TO MAKE THIS ABOUT BURBANK I THINK THIS IS SOMETHING YOU NEED TO BE MINDFUL OF AND THE ENTIRE. ACTION OF YOUR PROJECT YOU KNOW I ONLY EXPERIENCE AND ONE IS BUT I IMAGINE THAT YOU'RE HAVING THE SAME KIND OF- INTERACTIONS WITH OTHER AGENCIES ACROSS THE STATE AND IT'S A CONCERN OF MINE. THANK YOU WITH THAT THANK YOU. WITH THAT I'D LIKE TO THANK DIRECTOR KELLY AND VICE CHAIR RICHARDS AND INVITE THE SECOND PANEL COME FORWARD. AND AS THEY'RE COMING FORWARD I WANT TO LOOK KNOWLEDGE THE BOARD MEMBERS OF THE HIGH SPEED RAIL AUTHORITY WHO ARE PRESENT. WE HAVE. DANNY CURTAIN OF COURSE VICE CHAIR RICHARDS HENRY PEREIRA AND JIM GILL MATTIE WHO ARE OUR NEWEST MEMBERS. SO NOW I WOULD LIKE TO INVITE DANTE CURTAIN EVANS HELEN KIRSTINE LEWIS THOMPSON STACEY MORTENSEN AND STEPHANIE WEAKENS TRYING TO KEEP THINGS THE SAME TO I MAY START WITH MARK EVANS AND THEN TRANSITION TO DANNY CURTAIN SINCE YOU HAVE A PRESENTATION TO MAKE. YES THANK YOU I MARK EVANS- REPRESENT THE EARLY TRAIN OPERATOR I WORK WITH THE DEUTSCHE BAHN ENGINEERING AND CONSULTING USA AND- THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR FOR ALLOWING ME TO SPEAK AND FELLOW. COMMITTEE MEMBERS. YES I'LL PUT THIS IN A LITTLE BIT OF CONTEXT FOR YOU LAST- SO YOU HAVE A PAPER COPY IN FRONT OF YOU. SO AND RIGHT BEHIND YOU THAT IS THE PRESENTATION LAST SPRING OF THE EARLY TRAIN OPERATOR COMPLETED A STUDY LOOKING AT- TO POTENTIAL EARLY OPERATION SEGMENTS ONE BEING THE PENINSULA. FLOOR WHICH IS FOURTH IN KING THE SAN FRANCISCO BAY AREA- DOWN TO GILROY STATION AND THE OTHER CORRIDOR. WAS THE- CENTRAL VALLEY QUARTER SO A MERCED OR MADERA TWO POPLAR AVENUE AND THEN LATER EXPANDED TO INCLUDE- MERCED AND BAKER SEAL. THE RESULT OF THAT STUDY IS ON SLIDE TO. AND THE STUDY BASICALLY LOOKED AT REVENUE VERSUS OPERATING INCOME OVER THAT OVER THOSE CORRIDORS IN THE FUTURE. AND THE- CENTRAL CORRIDOR WE DETERMINED THAT'S WE COULD OFFER MORE TRADE DEALS THAT ARE THE AUTHORITY BUT OFFER TRAINING. THERE CAPTION TRAVEL. PROFICIENT PASTA WHILE YOU LOOK AT. SANDEL SEGMENT ALSO FACED AND- BEING A TODAY THE EIGHT SAN JOAQUIN LAW. ON THE PENINSULA WHAT ARE WE BERMAN THAT WITH. DURING ROBUST ACUTE BILL NETWORK IN THE FINANCE ORDER WOULD BE PAYING. STRANGE THING FOR THE RIGHT STATION INTO TWELVE FOURTEEN K. BUT IT WOULD BE SOMEONE FROM APPLE AND YOU ALREADY. AND THAT WILL ASSIST. WELCOME XIN OF. THE AND THE AND THE RESULT THAT WAS PRESENTED IN THE PROJECT UPDATE REPORT BY THE CALIFORNIA SPEED RAIL FORTY. A DURING A DEER IN THE PROJECT UPDATE REPORT THERE IS A SLIGHT THREE THERE IS A LOOK AT THE INVESTMENTS REQUIRED. OF FOR THE CENTRAL VALLEY AND THESE INVESTORS WERE LAID OUT FOR FIFTEEN POINT SIX BILLION DOLLARS WOULD BE REQUIRED TO COMPLETE- THE- MADERA TWO POPLAR AVENUE LAKE. NOT INCLUDING WERE SAID AND NOT INCLUDING BAKERSFIELD AND IT WOULD NOT INCLUDE THE PURCHASE OF HIGH SPEED RAIL ROLLING STOCK- THE NEXT BAR YOU SEE IN THE MIDDLE IS CHAU SEVENTEEN POINT NINE BILLION WOULD BE REQUIRED IF WE- TEND ITSELF BAKER. BUILD INCLUDE BUILDINGS TALK THAT EXTENSION THEN THE FOR A FALL RIGHT FOR SHIP. TO BIGGEST INCLUDE. ALSO SAMPLING STUFF WOULD BE TWENTY FOUR BIT. QUESTION CAME UP. FIFTY SIX BROUGH BUT THAT OKAY WHERE IS THE FOUR POINT EIGHT BILLION COMING WAS ADDRESS IN THE QUESTION WAS IS THAT THE BEST. TO AND THE FOUR POINT EIGHT. AND SO WE AS THE EACH YOUR COMMISSION TO THE INCOMPLETE A SECOND STUDY. WHICH WOULD LOOK AT THE A SIDE BY SIDE BY SIDE COMPARISON. OF THAT FOUR POINT EIGHT BILLION DOLLARS BEING INVESTED IN PENCIL CORRIDORS SUCH A NORTHERN CALIFORNIA OR CENTRAL VALLEY OR SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA IN THE LA AREA. SO WE STARTED IN THE SUMMER TAKING A LOOK AT THAT ON SLIDE. FOR WE OUTLINED WHAT I JUST SAID VERBALLY BASICALLY IS WHAT THE SCORES WOULD WOULD LOOK AT THE SELL SIDE BY SIDE COMPARISON AND BEST WAY TO INVEST. FOUR EIGHT BILLION. SLIDE I'VE. HE START OUR QUALITY IF IT TALKS ABOUT QUALITATIVE ANALYSIS SO WE BROKE TO STUDY INTO TWO PHASES PHASE ONE IS A QUALITATIVE PHASE. SHOT TO THE STATE OF THE AIR SUCH AS- LÀ SOME OF THE TRAINING CALTRANS CAL STAR. AND WHAT REGIONAL COMMITTEE IN AND OUT. WELL AS AN- THE EIGHT. WE LOOKED AT. HOW HOW BEST THE MONEY THOSE IN THOSE AREAS AS WE GATHER DATE TO OPEN OPEN SKATE OR NUMBER ENDING UP OF WHAT THE PIECES IN HOW WOULD YOU THE FUNDS THEY ARE CONSTRUCTION. AND IN ONE FILE. THEY'RE ALL OF MINES. AND WE JUST PERCENT WE HAVE. IS THAT WE FROM THERE AND SAW THE POLITICS OF THEIR EARLY INDICATOR OF HOW WE THINK THE QUANTITATIVE PHASE WILL GO IN THE QUANTITATIVE SPACE WILL DEEP DIVE THEN INTO RIDERSHIP GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS AND CONGESTION RELIEF AND THOSE THREE QUARTERS AND WE'RE WORKING ON THAT NOW SO THE QUALITATIVE ANALYSIS WAS RELEASED TO THE PUBLIC I THINK JUST A WEEK AGO. AND THE FULL REPORT IS AVAILABLE ON THE CALIFORNIA HIGH SPEED RAIL WEB PAGE. SO I TAKE YOU TO SLIDE SIX. ON SLIDE SIX THEN WE GET REALLY INTO THE MEAT OF FOR TALKING ABOUT. ALL ALL. TOWARDS THE CHART IS A LOT OF. ON THE FAR LEFT. THE THREE CORE FORCE. CORD OR NO CASH COW BUT THAT INCLUDES ABOUT FOUR DOOR SOUTHERN BEFORE BORDER NEXT CALL. ALSO PROVIDED AT COST. THE THIRD ONE FROM THE HELP BLESSED TALKS ABOUT STING SCENARIO THIS IS WHERE WE ARE TODAY BEFORE IT MULLIN. AND ALL THROUGH THE MORE TELL. THE CHART SCENARIO TO A LOOKS WHAT YES MA'AM WE COULD PUT IT. IN THOSE THREE CORRIDORS. HE WHAT I DID. THIS WOULD BE REQUIRED. AND IT'S THREE OR FOUR WOULD BE BORDERS OPERATE IN FOR. SERVICE IN THOSE QUARTERS BUT THIS PAST WEEK. I JUST SIT HERE TO BE IN MONEY THAT WE ARE THERE'S WORK ON. NUMBER TRAINS DIRECT. THESE NUMBER BIGELOW STREET. PORTER WE HAVE A WE'RE MOVING TOWARDS FOR UP TO FIVE CAL STRAIGHT. OUR WITH THE OCCASIONAL. ENHANCES ALIGNED CURRENTLY BEING- IN CONSTRUCT THEY WILL ADD THEY'LL HAVE TO SO CAL TRAINS PER CORRECTION UP OUR DURING FOR A TOTAL OF SIX TRAINS BEING OFFERED- AND THE CENTRAL VALLEY THERE IS NO ENHANCEMENT TO THE CENTRAL VALLEY BECAUSE IT'S THE CALIFORNIA HIGH SPEED RAIL SYSTEM WHICH IS UNDER CONSTRUCTION SO THERE WOULD BE NO CHANGE AND THEN IN THE SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA PRIMARILY THROUGH METROLINK- YOU HAVE TO EXPRESS TRAINS PER HOUR FOR REGIONAL TRAINS PER HOUR PER DIRECTION DURING PEAK FOR A TOTAL OF SIX TRAINS. AND NONE OF THOSE ARE ELECTRIFIED UNDER THE CURRENT FUNDING SCENARIOS. IF WE MOVE THE FOUR POINT EIGHT BILLION DOLLARS INTO THE PENINSULA CORRIDOR. WHAT WE WOULD BE ABLE TO ACCOMPLISH THERE IS WE WOULD HAVE AGE CALTRAIN TRAINS RUNNING PER DIRECTION OF PER HOUR DURING PEAK- AND STE IT WOULD BE ELECTRIFIED AS CURRENTLY. ON A PLAN FOR THE BILLION DOLLARS WITH A SAID WE GO FOR IT MOVE. PACIFIC BACK. TO THE SIDE IN THE DOOR- AND BRINGING TO WILL PROVIDE TAX TO SUPPORT HIGH SPEED UP PROFIT. AGAIN THE MONEY GOING TOWARDS ENDING. TOP END UP NORTH. BURKE. TINO SIR BECAUSE COMPLETED UNDER THAT SOME. IN CALIFORNIA. THE DISH OF TWO REGIONAL TRAINS IN THE TOP I DON'T TO SIX PLUS RESTAURANTS EIGHT. OUR PERFECTION IN THOSE ARE ELECT. SHE POINTED OUT THE CALL TO DO THE COPS TO A SCENARIO THREE BOB THIS IS THE RUN BETWEEN BURBANK AIRPORT ANNA STATION ONLY THE ONLY AREA THAT'S EARLY IN CASE. FOR YOU. WE ESTIMATE THAT WILL REQUIRE I'M SO BILLION DOLLARS TO CLEAN SENATE BILL THREE. FOR THE BILL WOULD COME FROM THE HIGH SPEED RAIL FUND IT. SENATE BILL FOUR HOW DO WHICH- WELL HI THE REAL PERSON THE CORRIDORS. OF WHAT HE CALTRAIN. GILROY TO JOSE. AS COMPLY FIVE WE THEN RUN H. CALTRAIN BRAINS TO SPEED IS FOR TEN FULL. THE ADDITIONAL COSTS THERE THREE AND ON TOP OF THE FOR DINNER THREE AND WOOD. IT WOULDN'T. INCLUDE HIGH SPEED ONLY STOCK IN THE DISH FUNDS WOULD NOT INCLUDE. USED OUT HAVE HIGH SPEED RAIL SYSTEM POOREST TRADE GO YOU DO HAVE INFRASTRUCTURE THAT RICHARD CONNECT IT TO THE CENTRAL VALLEY. TO ACHIEVE TO EXPRESS TRAINS PER DIRECTION THAT PEAK PLUS SIX REGIONAL AND TO HIGH SPEED RAIL TRAINS WOULD REQUIRE ADDITIONAL FIVE BILLION DOLLARS ON TOP OF THE SEVEN AND SCENARIO THREE SO YOU'RE TALKING BETWEEN- TEN AND TWELVE BILLION DOLLARS OF WHICH THE FOUR POINT EIGHT ONLY PARTIALLY FUNDS. SO WHAT CONCLUSIONS CAN WE DRAW FROM THAT. IF WE LOOK AT SLIDE SEVEN. THE MAIN THING WE'RE SAYING HERE IS THAT UNDER THE PENINSULAR QUARTER WITH THE INVEST IN A FOUR BILLION. DOLLARS I CAN'T. DR THE TRIBE FROM. WHY BUT YOU CANNOT IN OVER A HUNDRED MILES AN BECAUSE THE LEVEL PROCESS IN THAT COURT. DEFINITELY. THREE EXIST SYSTEM. BUT QUESTION IS WHICH WE THREE OR IS THE FALL INTO ARE YOU BRING TO THE- BILL FOR ABOUT THE WE WERE BEFORE THE BILL YOU HAVE A HIGH SPEED SERVER. WE MENTIONED. IT'S A HUNDRED AND- OUR AND WERE EVEN ABLE TO DEMONSTRATE. A STEP CLOSER TOWARDS ROUTE THREE ROUTE CITY FAURIA. LISTENER ON THE HELLO NICK CORD. EVE READ SOME PATIENTS BY. X. AS WELL SELECT CATION. WELL IN CALIFORNIA COST OF ROUGHLY OF BILL OUR- ABLE TO USE. TEN TWENTY FIVE MILE AN HOUR OR. THE COUPLE OF MORE JUST REITERATE WHAT I SPOKE ABOUT SO I JUST HAD A FEW HIGH POINTS IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA QUARTER REQUIRES RE INVESTMENT ENDED IT INTO THE HIGH ALAN SMITH AND THAT'S ADDITIONAL LEAD AND COMPOUND. AND THE BILLING SYSTEM AND THIS PLAN HIGHLIGHTS THE GLORY FOR NON HEIST ROLLING STOCK IN RIGHT STERN OTHER PEOPLE THERE MY PERSONAL EFFECTS FROM STEP ON HIGH SPEED RAIL SERVICE CLICK WITH THIS PROGRAM. WHAT DOES ADDS COMPOUNDS. BUT WE'RE NOT TALKING BEHIND RAIL IN THE CORPORATE. IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA SCENARIOS SIMILAR BELIEFS. BEING THEM IF YOU OF THE MONTH ENTER CALIFORNIA IT DOES PROVIDE FUNDING FOR FEW WHAT'S IN THE METRO SYSTEM. IN ANAHEIM AND BANK. NOT ENOUGH. YOU TOO LITTLE. AND IT WOULD STILL IT WILL STOP AND IT'S NOT CAN TO THE CENTRAL VALLEY STILL I'M STILL ALONE SEGMENTS WITHOUT ANSWER IN THE REGION CONNECT THIS MOVE INTO THAT AND HOT BURBANK. IT WON'T BE BENEFITS THEY'RE- THAT IS TRUE ABOUT. SANDEL HIGH SPEED RAIL OPERATION BETWEEN MERCED IN BAKERSFIELD AND WE'RE RUNNING AT TO MILES AN HOUR- WE BELIEVE WILL CREATE SIGNIFICANT VALUE SIGNIFICANT TRYST AND WILL ALSO IMPROVE THE OWNERSHIP EVEN THOUGH I HAVEN'T ON THE QUANTITY SECTION THAT'S BUT WE BELIEVE IN THEIR OWN THE WRITER WITH ACTION. ENHANCED ACE AND ENHANCE WALKING. OUR SYSTEM. HE SAID WE'VE IT POST CATION INTACT WITH CAL STE IN THE UPGRADE THE EIGHT SAN JOAQUIN LAW. PETER LOCKED INTO THE BACKBONE WORK CITY THE. THREE MORE THAN DOUBLE REDUCTION OF TRUCK TIME ALL SPOT FROM THE PLAYERS YES- AND AGAIN THE COMPANY IT HAPPENS. ONCE IF LEAVE THE MONEY IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY IF THE MONEY IS REMAINS IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY THE HIGH SPEED RAIL SERVICE IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY OR EXCUSE ME IF WE DO NOT. TAKE A LEAVE THEM FOUR POINT EIGHT BILLION DOLLARS IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY IF WE DO NOT LEAVE IT THERE. THE HIGH SPEED RAIL SERVICE IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY. WILL BE. DELAYED UNTIL ADDITIONAL FUNDS FOR VALLEY TO THAT OF THE PROJECT IS NOT SO BAD. I HAVE. HE. YOU'LL HAVE THE INFRASTRUCTURE THERE BUT YOU HAVE THE RIGHT START. WE'LL BE RIGHT THE LIMIT A LIMITED RUN. FULLER TO CONNECT WITH THE NORTH THEN WITH MERCED IMMERSED WITH A SINCE. WILL BE PROBLEMATIC AS THE EIGHT NINE WILL THEN DEAD IN TWO PERCENT SINCE THEN WE- PUT FOLKS LAWSON. TO MADERA THIS PROBLEM TODAY OTHER RUN. ON THE SYSTEM TO THE RIGHT HIGH SPEED RAIL THE ONLY. OTHER INFRASTRUCTURE WERE BERMAN WILL BE S. NO WAY. BUT HIGH GROUND AS YOU'RE USING A DIFFERENT KIND OF SIGNALING TECH BUDGIE AND INFRASTRUCTURE SUPPORT FOR HIGH SPEED RAIL THE USE FOR CONVENTIONAL SO WE'RE ASSUMING THAT THE RAIL JUST WOULDN'T BE LEFT THERE ON USE THAT YOU WOULD RUN SOME CONVENTIONAL TRAFFIC ON THE- MADERA TO POP OR RAP. AVENUE CORRIDOR OPERATIONAL EXPENSES FOR THAN UNDER UTILIZED OF AN INFRASTRUCTURE ASSETS SO WE'RE BUILDING IT FOR HIGH SPEED RAIL OR USING IT FOR A OF MORE CONVENTIONAL SYSTEM SO WE'RE- PROBABLY NOT USING. THE IT TO ITS FULL EXTENSION AND POTENTIAL. AND YOU CAN HAVE LIMITED ENVIRONMENTAL IMPROVEMENTS BECAUSE IT WILL NOT BE- ELECTRIFIED. THE MOST LIKELY BE SOME KIND OF A DIESEL SYSTEM- AND SO YOU'RE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS AND OTHER CARBON FOOTPRINT- OPPORTUNITIES THAT YOU HAVE A HIGH SPEED RAIL OR NOT ARE NOT THERE. SO IF WE- DO COMPLETES THE HOT GO BACK TO SLIDE TEN IF YOU'LL JUST BEAR WITH ME IF WE DO COMPLETE THE- THE SEGMENT. YOU'LL GET THE STANDALONE HIGH SPEED RAIL OPERATE BETWEEN MERCED BAKER'S SADDAM RATIONS AND ALSO START. IT STARTS THE SYSTEM HIGH SPEED RAIL IN CALIFORNIA BELIEVE IT. CAN'T VALUE BY NEXT TO OUR CITIES THE QUARTERBACK KILLED THROUGH- SAID I'M MORE TRIP MILE TREK TRAVEL TIME. IT'S THE A WIDE REAL PLAN YES MA'AM AND FOR A DENTAL OPULENCE. SO WE DID OUR QUALITY I DO NOT THIS AND NOW I'M DEEP THE QUANTITATIVE ANALYSIS AND AGAIN WE'RE WORKING WITH OUR STAKEHOLDERS SO- MISTREATMENT TO YOUR POINT EARLIER WEIRD CLOSE COMMUNICATION. I LOG CAL AND CAL IS METRIC. THE LOS ANGELES. NO BETTER THAN SOME OF IT AND SPIEGEL- TRACK ARE TRANSLATE THE HOUSE SAM WALKED WELCOME. WALKING JOIN OUR THOUGHT TO PROVIDE THE INFORMATION GET BACK INTO ALSO MAKE SURE WE CORPORATE. OUR PORT. THE FINAL REPORT WILL SOME TYPE OF A CALL. REGIONAL IF IT'S A NEEDS AT ALL TAKE A LOOK AT AND QUANTITATIVE DATA ON RACE RIGHT. GAS ACTION AND I'M JUST REALLY. WE EXPECT OF THAT. BOARD OF READY MADE OF Q. ONE TWENTY TWENTY THANK YOU THANK YOU MISTER EVANS AND BEFORE WE GO ON TO DANNY CURTAIN AND ALLOW ASSEMBLYMEMBER FRIEDMAN SOME QUESTIONS THANKS GIVEN HOW MANY OF YOU THERE ARE THINK IT'S EASIER FOR US WAS FOR ME TO ASK QUESTIONS OF EACH YOU WHEN YOU SPEAK INSTEAD OF. BY THE TIME THEY GET DOWN THERE I WANT TO REMEMBER WHAT YOU SAID- I HAVE A QUESTION ABOUT IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY FULL BUILD SLIDE ABOUT THE MORE EFFICIENT COST PER MILE AN IMPROVED COST RECOVERY FROM FAIR REVENUES PARK SO IS THE IS PART OF YOUR ANALYSIS ABOUT- KIND OF THE OF THE- FULL BUILD. A NOW. I HAVE TO PUT UP THERE OKAY IT'S NOT THAT IMPORTANT THAT THE PUT IN THAT. THE FULL BUILD BEING THE SORT OF PREFERRED- SITUATION HERE IS THAT BASED ON. THE FINDINGS ARE BASED ON THE COST NOT INCREASING THEM THAT WHAT HAPPENS IF AS WE BUILD THE COSTS GO UP IF IT'S NOT EXACTLY WHAT WE THINK IT'S GOING TO BE AT THIS MOMENT IF. AS COSTS OFTEN DO ON LARGE PROJECTS THERE ARE COST OVERRUNS HOW DOES THAT CHANGE THE ANALYSIS. WHEN WE DID OUR ANALYSIS WE HAVE TO USE THE DATA THAT'S PRESENTED NOW THE JETTA COULD CHANGE FOR US ALL OBVIOUSLY IT HAS CHANGED HIS FOR THE PROJECT BUT- WE HAD TO KIND OF DRAW A LINE AND SAY OKAY THIS IS WHAT WE KNOW OTHERWISE WE START GETTING INTO MULTIPLE SAY UNDERSTAND THAT BUT LET'S ASSUME THAT THE COSTS GO UP. LET'S ASSUME THAT AS THEY HAVE FOR THE ENTIRE HISTORY OF THIS PROJECT THE COSTS CONTINUE TO RISE. DOESN'T THAT THEN CHANGE YOUR BOTTOM LINE OF YOU DECIDING THAT THIS. AT ONE OF THE REASONS THAT THIS IS THE PREFERRED. OPTION BECAUSE OF THAT COST ANALYSIS IF THE COSTS GO UP. THAT MIGHT NOT MAKE YOU MIGHT CHANGE YOUR- YOUR- RECOMMENDATION OF THIS BEING THE PREFERRED- ALTERNATIVE CRACKED I THINK OF THE COSTS GO UP WE WOULD HAVE TO RE LOOK AT IT AND. RECALCULATED FOR SURE NOW MY OTHER QUESTION IS. YOU HAVE A LINE THAT SAYS EARLY HIGH SPEED RAIL SERVICES CREATE SIGNIFICANT VALUE. CAN YOU EXPLAIN WHY WHAT WHAT IS THE VALUE OF. QUALITATIVE A STAMP POINT WE'RE LOOKING AT. THE VALUE OF PROVING THAT IT CAN BE DONE SO AS OF THE WOMEN I HIGHLY RAIL IT'S BEEN DONE ALL OVER THE WORLD I MEAN. NOBODY'S SAYING YOU CAN'T RUN A TRAIN AT TWO HUNDRED MILES IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. BUT WHAT'S THE VALUE OF THAT. I THINK IT'S CHANGING CULTURE IT'S CHANGING THE MINDSET OF THE- OF THE- CITIZENS ALONG THE CORRIDOR BUT ALSO OF POTENTIAL INVESTORS. SEE I ACTUALLY DISAGREE WITH YOU I THINK THAT. YOU HAVE THAT THERE'S ONLY ONE WAY TO PROVE VALUE. THAT'S RIDERSHIP. YES THE ONLY VALUE YOU HAVE IT'S NOT PROVING YOU CAN RUN A TRAIN A TWO HUNDRED MILES AN HOUR WE ALL KNOW YOU CAN BUILD A TRAIN THAT RUNS TWO HUNDRED MILES OUR IT'S OLD TECHNOLOGY. AROUND THE WORLD SORT OF A GIVEN. IN OTHER PARTS OF THE WORLD. SO WE KNOW WE CAN DO THAT- THE ONLY WAY YOU PRO VALUE. IS IF YOU INCREASE RIDERSHIP OTHERWISE IT'S ALL I MEAN WHAT IT WHAT ELSE WHAT'S THE OTHER PURPOSE. IT'S INCREASING RIDERSHIP AND SO I'M SORRY YOU I UNDERSTAND THAT THIS HEARING IS NOT ON YOUR TWO YOU KNOW THIS THIS JUST POPPED UP YOU KNOW. YOU WEREN'T. DOING YOUR ANALYSIS FOR THIS. BUT WHAT ALL RIGHT WHAT WE NEED TO SEE IS THE RIDERSHIP ANALYSIS THAT'S- AND WHAT'S WHAT'S MISSING FROM ALL OF THESE. IS THAT YOU ARE. VERY DIFFERENT POPULATION CENTERS. A VERY DIFFERENT NEED FOR MASS TRANSIT AND ALL OF THESE DIFFERENT AREAS. AND EVEN WITH THE BEST. MOST CONVENIENT SERVICE IN THE WORLD YOU STILL HAVE A CAPPED RIDERSHIP BASED ON POPULATION WHERE PEOPLE ARE WORKING ON WHERE PEOPLE ARE GOING. SO WHAT WOULD I THINK WHAT WE NEED TO SEE TO HAVE ANY IDEA. OF WE'RE- WHERE WE DEMONSTRATE. BY ABILITY IS BY LOOKING AT THAT INCREASED RIDERSHIP BECAUSE IN MY MIND AND JUST TO CUT TO THE CHASE. ANYTHING THAT WE DO ANYWHERE ALONG THE SYSTEM ASSUMING THAT OUR GOAL IS TO BUILD SAN DIEGO TO SAN FRANCISCO WHICH BY THE WAY I WANT TO SEE I WANT TO SEE THAT HIGH SPEED RAIL SYSTEM MY LIFETIME. I WANT TO BE ABLE TO GO SAN DIEGO TO SAN FRANCISCO BUT THE WAY WE GET THERE IS BY INCREASING RIDERSHIP KIND OF ANYWHERE ALONG THAT'S THAT SECTION TO WHERE YOU HAVE A LARGE POPULATION SAYING WE ARE NOW. WE'RE IN ON TRAINS WERE ALL TAKEN THE TRAIN TO WORK WE'RE ALL TAKING THE TRAIN WE GO AND CALIFORNIA WE DEMAND THAT YOU GIVE US THE FULL SYSTEM. RIGHT UNTIL YOU HAVE THE RIDERSHIP THAT STARTS TO DEMAND THAT PEOPLE WANT TO RIDE THE TRAIN. BECAUSE YOU'RE NEVER GOING TO GET THE WHOLE THING BUILT BECAUSE IT'S JUST THEORETICAL SO WE HAVE TO DO SOMETHING THAT'S GOING TO INCREASE RIDERSHIP KIND OF IN REAL TIME. AND SO THAT TO ME IS WHAT DEMONSTRATES. THE PROJECT. NOT THAT WE CAN RUN A TRAIN A TWO HUNDRED MILES AN HOUR RUNNING A TRAIN AND TWO HUNDRED MILES AN HOUR THAT NO ONE TAKES. DOES THE OPPOSITE OF WHAT WE WANT. RIGHT IF YOU REALLY WANT TO GET INVESTMENT YOU HAVE TO SHOW THE PEOPLE CAN BUY THE TICKETS. SO THAT'S WHAT WE NEED TO SEE IS WHERE DO WE WHAT WHAT INVESTMENTS DO WE MAKE. WITH HIGH SPEED RAIL DOLLARS. THAT INCREASE RIDERSHIP THE MOST. ALONG THAT SYSTEM ANYWHERE IN THAT SYSTEM. THAT SHOWS AN INVESTOR THE PEOPLE ARE WILLING TO BUY TICKETS ON A TRAIN. SO THAT'S MY POINT AND THAT'S WHAT WE NEED TO SEE IN YOUR ANALYSIS I THINK TO REALLY. TOOK YOU CAN'T HAVE A FINDING YOU CAN'T HAVE A PRELIMINARY FINDING ABOUT WHERE TO SPEND THIS MONEY UNTIL YOU KNOW WE'RE RIDERSHIP. CAN BE INCREASED THE MOST. SO THE FACT THAT YOU HAVE BEEN OF A PRELIMINARY FACT FINDING THAT HAS NOTHING ON RIDERSHIP SHOWS ME THAT. YOU DON'T HAVE A FINDING. I THINK THE QUESTION IS WHICH HOW DO WE GET TO HIGH SPEED RAIL. THE FASTEST IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WHAT'S THE MISSION OF CALIFORNIA HIGH SPEED RAIL AUTHORITY. IS OUR STANDING AS THAT THE MISSION THIS IS TO PROVIDE A HIGH SPEED RAIL SERVICE BETWEEN- IN OUR PHASE ONE. OR THE VALLEY TO VALLEY. BAKERSFIELD AND SAND. SEVERANCE OKAY- THAT'S WHAT WE'RE FOCUSED ON SO WE'RE LOOKING AT WITHIN THAT CONTEXT IF YOU HAVE FOR THE MONEY AVAILABLE AND YOU CAN MOVE IT ANYWHERE WITHIN THAT VALLEY TO VALLEY LINE OR EVEN THE PHASE ONE LINE. WHAT'S THE BEST PLACE TO HELP YOU ACHIEVE YOUR MISSION AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE LOOKING AT AND I WOULD SAY ONE MORE THING QUICKLY LOUDEST. AND THE QANTAS IN A QUANTITATIVE PHASE WE WILL GET INTO THE RIDERSHIP NUMBERS AND BILL WOULD PROVIDE THOSE TWENTY. I HAVE THAT. I THINK SEE YOU'RE THINKING OF IT. AS AN ENGINEER. IS HOW DO WE BUILD THE FASTEST TRAIN. THEN THE FACETS AMOUNT OF TIME RIGHT THAT'S WHAT ENGINEER WOULD SAY HOW DO WE TAKE THE MONEY WE HAVE AND BUILD A TRAIN THAT GOES REALLY FAST FOR THE MOST DISTANCE. AS A POLITICIAN I SAY HOW DO I MAKE A TRAIN THAT GETS MORE PEOPLE ONTO IT SO THAT I CAN SHOW MY COLLEAGUES IN THE LEGISLATURE THEY SHOULD INVEST MORE MONEY IN TRAINS. I THINK IT'S A DIFFERENT WAY OF THINKING ABOUT IT AND WHEN I HEAR DEMONSTRATING BY ABILITY IT'S DEMONSTRATING THAT I CAN GET A LOT OF PEOPLE THE RIGHT NOW DRIVING TO DECIDE INSTEAD TO TAKE THE TRAIN. SO JUST WANTED TO SAY THAT I THINK THERE'S TWO DIFFERENT WAYS OF DIAMOND OF VIABILITY MEANS HERE AND I THINK WE NEED TO BE CLEAR ABOUT THAT IS THE ONE THAT IS THE EASIEST TRAINED A BILL. IN THE FASTEST MAN OF TIME AND THERE'S THE ONE WHO ACTUALLY GETS PEOPLE TO CHANGE THEIR BEHAVIOR AND I DON'T THINK YOU CHANGE CULTURE BY DEMONSTRATING YOU CAN RUN A FAST TRAIN I THANK YOU CHANGE CULTURE BY GIVING PEOPLE WHO NEED TO GET SOMEWHERE A WAY TO GET THERE QUICKLY AND THAT'S MORE CONVENIENT THAN DRIVING. OKAY. THANK YOU IF I MAY JUST AS A COUNTERPOINT- AS WE PASSED PROP NAY THERE ARE CERTAIN REQUIREMENTS THAT NEED TO BE MATT AND SO I WOULD JUST TO INSURE THAT WE ARE TRYING TO INITIATE HIGH SPEED RAIL AS SOON AS POSSIBLE AS THAT WAS THE DIRECTION OF VOTERS GAVE TO US AND IT'S OUR RESPONSIBILITY TO TAXPAYERS WITHOUT I'D LIKE TO NOW TRANSITION TO. DANNY CARD. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN- SO MANY QUESTIONS RATE BUT I'M GOING TO START WITH THE WRITTEN STATEMENTS SO. THANK YOU AGAIN FOR INVITING ME. TO TRANSPORTATION COMMITTEE HAS BEEN REAL OVERSIGHT HEARING. OBVIOUSLY THERE'S NUMEROUS COMPLEX QUESTIONS AND ISSUES THAT THE SERVICE QUESTION AT THE STATE LEGISLATIVE LEVEL- THE PROBLEM THAT I AM SEEING AS HOW THIS DISCUSSION IS BEING FRAMED- AND IT'S VERY MUCH AN US VERSUS THEM KIND OF CONVERSATION ALL OR NOTHING IN OR OUT. AND I WANT TO START BY SAYING I AM VERY DISAPPOINTED IN THE RECENT FRESNO BEE EDITORIAL REGARDING HIGH SPEED RAIL I'M GONNA QUOTE THAT EDITORIAL SINGLE LARGE BRIDGES AND OTHER STRUCTURES THAT ARE TO CARRY THE HIGH SPEED TRAINS ARE UNDER CONSTRUCTION HERE. AND ONE FEAR HAS BEEN THAT IF THE PROJECT WHEN FINISHED. THOSE STRUCTURES WOULD STAND OUT AS THE STONEHENGE LIKE MONUMENT TO THE STATE UTILITY ON THE BULLET TRAIN. I WAS APPOINTED TO THE HIGH SPEED RAIL- BOARD IN TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN BY THE SPEAKER. AND NO DISCUSSION HAS EVER TAKEN PLACE. IN PUBLIC OR CLOSED SESSION AND I PER HEARD ANY BOARD MEMBER PAST OR PRESENT MENTION THE IDEA OF ABANDONING THE CENTRAL VALLEY. THOSE FRAMING THE CONVERSATION IN THIS WAY ARE ACTING RESPONSIBLY IN MY MIND AND DOING A DISSERVICE TO THE FUTURE OF THE HIGH SPEED RAIL IN THE VALLEY AND IN CALIFORNIA. IN FACT ACCORDING TO THE LAW OF THE HIGH SPEED RAIL AUTHORITY IS REQUIRED BY STATUTE. TO BUILD QUOTE USABLE SEGMENTS. THAT WILL BENEFIT LOCAL TRANSIT SYSTEMS IF WE FAIL TO COMPLETE OUR PROJECT. I HOPE THIS HEARING WILL HELP REFRAIN THAT CONVERSATION SO REAL OPTIONS CAN BE DISCUSSED. LET ME KNOW HOWEVER THERE HAS BEEN REPEATED MENTION AND CONCERNED ABOUT COMPLETING THE BASIC CIVIL INFRASTRUCTURE TRACK SYSTEMS OF THE ONE HUNDRED NINETEEN MILE CENTRAL VALLEY CORRIDOR BY THE TWENTY TWENTY TWO DEADLINE. AS REQUIRED UNDER THE OUR AGREEMENT THAT HAS BEEN DISCUSSED QUITE A BIT. SO MOVING ON. IN A LEGISLATIVE HEARING IN TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHTEEN SENATOR GALGIANI POINTED OUT THAT ONE OF THE REASONS WE WERE ABLE TO GET HAPPEN TRADE FUNDING IS BECAUSE OF AGREEMENTS WE MADE TO BUILD CONNECTED SYSTEMS THAT SERVE LOCAL AREAS AS WELL AS ACROSS THE ENTIRE STATE. BRIAN KELLY- HIGH SPEED RAIL STE HE AT THIS TIME- AND- I'M THE SAYS AT THE SAME LEGISLATIVE HEARING AND TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN. OUR GOAL HE SAID OUR GOAL IS TO PROVIDE MOBILITY AND MAXIMIZE CONNECTIVITY FOR CALIFORNIANS. WHAT EVER IT TAKES SO THAT THE PUBLIC CAN START RECEIVING BENEFITS FROM THE SYSTEM EARLIER. RATHER THAN LATER. THAT'S THE DISCUSSION I'M INTERESTED IN PURSUING. THE HIGH SPEED RAIL PROJECT IS IN THE PROCESS OF PROVIDING A VASTLY IMPROVED RAIL CARD OR IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY. THAT MEANS NEW DEDICATED TRACK NO LONGER SHARING TRACKS DESIGNED FOR FREIGHT TRAINS THAT MEANS SEPARATE STRAIGHTER AND FASTER AND MORE FREQUENT PASSENGER TRAINS. THAT IS NOT IN DISPUTE. THE QUESTION THAT IS NOT BEING ADDRESSED IS SIMPLY THIS. IS IT BETTER TO RIDE A ONE HUNDRED SEVENTY MILE PER HOUR TRAIN FROM BAKERSFIELD TUMOR SAID. BUT THEN HAVE TO GET OFF AND WAIT FOR A DIFFERENT TRAIN. AND I MIGHT ADD CAPABLE OF ONE HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE MILES AN HOUR. IF YOUR DESTINATION IS SAN JOSE OR SACRAMENTO. THE UP. THE ANNOUNCES THAT YOU'VE SEEN BEFORE YOU IS BASED ON EXISTING CONDITION NOT ON UPGRADING AN EXISTING- TRAIN NINE ELECTRIFY TWO HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE MILES AN HOUR THAT IS THE ANALYSIS THAT I HAVE NOT SEEN AND HAVE NOT. BEEN COMPARED. OR IS IT BETTER TO HAVE A ONE SEAT RIDE THROUGHOUT THE CENTRAL VALLEY FROM BAKERSFIELD TO MERCED. THEN ON TO SAN JOSE OR SACRAMENTO ON A ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE MILES. PER HOUR TRAIN- THAT GOES TO THE RIDERSHIP QUESTION. I'VE ASK PEOPLE THAT QUESTION MANY TIMES. UNLESS THERE IS A DRAMATIC DIFFERENCE IN TIME AND- I MIGHT QUESTION THAT DIFFERENCE BETWEEN- BAKERSFIELD AND MERCED IF IT'S A HUNDRED TWENTY MILE PER HOUR ON TWENTY FIVE MILE PER HOUR. LOW EMISSION HIGH SPEED DIESEL VERSUS A HUNDRED SEVENTY MILE AN HOUR TRAIN THAT'S A DIFFERENT COMPARISON. BUT ASSUMING THERE IS NOT A DRAMATIC DIFFERENCE IN TIME THE ONE SEAT RIDE IS ALWAYS THE ANSWER ALWAYS. BUSINESS TRAVELERS PREFER THE SCHEDULING CERTAINTY GETTING TO THEIR APPOINTMENTS ON TIME. BECAUSE THERE'S A SCHEDULE ON ONE TRAINED IT'LL HAVE TO GET OFTEN CHANGE IN THE CONVENIENCE OF A ONE SEAT RIGHT SO THEY CAN GET SOME WORK DONE OR TAKE A NAP. FAMILIES ARE FAR MORE CONCERNED ABOUT THE SAFETY COMFORT AND CONVENIENCE OF MOVING THEIR CHILDREN ON A ONE SEAT RIDE- YOU JUST HEARD HURTING CHILDREN AROUND THE NAY- TRAIN STATION CAN BE PRETTY COMPLICATED EVEN IF IT IS A GOOD TIGHT- CONNECTION. A CASUAL TRAVELERS DEPEND ON ARRIVAL CERTAINTY SO THEY CAN BE PICKED UP. OR BE ON TIME FOR THE EVENTS THEY'RE TRAVELING TO MUSIC ENTERTAINMENT IT CETERA. SHORT OF CAREFULLY CAREFULLY COORDINATED INTER AGENCY AGENCY SCHEDULING. IT'S VERY POSSIBLE. THE TIME SAVED ON A HIGH SPEED TRAIN CAN EASILY BE LOST OR MADE WORSE BY TRANSFER TRANSFERS EVEN SMOOVE TRANSFERS. NEVER MIND THE INCONVENIENCE. WHAT A TRAVELER FROM FRESNO. AND I'M GOING TO. MAKE AN ESTIMATE OR A GUESSTIMATE WHO SAVE TWENTY TO THIRTY MINUTES ON A HIGH SPEED TRAIN AS COMPARED TO A HIGH SPEED DIESEL AT A HUNDRED AND TWENTY MILES AN HOUR AND TWENTY FIVE MILES AN HOUR. WITH A BENEFIT IF THEY HAD TO TRANSFER IN ORDER TO TRAVEL ANY FURTHER. VIRTUALLY EVERY RAIL INDUSTRY PERSON I HAVE EVER SPOKEN WITH BELIEVES THAT WITHIN A REASONABLY COMPETITIVE SYSTEM A WANTS TO EAT RIDE IS THE MOST SIGNIFICANT WAY TO BUILD RIDERSHIP GOING TO ASSEMBLY WOMAN. FRIEDMAN'S POINT. CAN THE ONE HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE MILE PER HOUR ONE SHEET RIGHT PROGRAM BE BUILT AT LEAST SEVERAL YEARS SOONER THAN THE HUNDRED SEVENTY MILE PER HOUR HIGH SPEED RAIL TRAIN. THE ANSWER'S YES WELL THE ONE SEAT RIDE PROGRAM BE DONE BILLIONS OF DOLLARS CHEAPER THAN THE ELECTRIC TRAIN. THE TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN PROJECT UPDATE REPORT INDICATES THERE WOULD BE SIGNIFICANT SAVINGS. WOULD BE SMARTER TO WAIT TO FIND ELECTRIFICATION AND PURCHASE OF HIGH SPEED TRAINS UNTIL THEY ARE ACTUALLY NEEDED FOR A TRUE ONE SEAT RIDE THROUGH A TUNNEL TO THE BAY AREA. I BELIEVE WE NEED TO HAVE THAT DISCUSSION AND I'M GLAD WE'RE HERE HAVING IT ACTUALLY. THE QUESTION BECOMES WHICH BUILDING BLOCKS CAN THE HIGH SPEED RAIL AUTHORITY FOCUS ON TO ADVANCE THE GOALS OF THE PROGRAM. THEY ARE CONGESTION RELIEF AND INCREASED RAIL RIDERSHIP. BY THE WAY THERE WAS SIGNIFICANT DISCUSSION ABOUT THE RIDERSHIP. STATEMENTS MADE EARLIER- WE DIDN'T GET INTO THEM HERE BUT I HAVE INCREMENTAL VERSUS SIGNIFICAN VERSUS INCREMENTAL- IF YOU HAVE A VERY HIGH RIDERSHIP NEW HAPPENING INCREMENTAL INCREASE IN TERMS OF OVERALL RIDERSHIP THAT COULD BE A LOT MORE SIGNIFICANT IF YOU HAVE SMALL RIDERSHIP AND HAVE A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE SO I WANT YOU TO. UNDERSTAND THE NUMBERS THAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT ASSEMBLYMAN FRIEDMAN- ARE VERY VERY IMPORTANT NOT NOT THE TERMINOLOGY. SO INCREASING REGIONAL CAN ACTIVITY. WHICH IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT THAT'S WHY SEE THERE'S NOBODY ON THE HIGH SPEED RAIL AUTHORITY WHOSE EVEN PREPARE TO DOT TALK TO TALK ABOUT NOT CONNECTING. TO HOPEFULLY THE A SYSTEM THE AMTRAK SYSTEM. AND SOMEWHERE BAKERSFIELD MAYBE A SYSTEM COMING FROM THE SOUTH EVENTUALLY BUT CERTAINLY THOSE TWO SYSTEMS ARE MISSION CRITICAL. LEVERAGING BUT LOCAL MATCHING FUNDS AND I WANT TO ADD THAT COMMENT HERE THIS IS PART OF THE FUNDAMENTAL- CHARGE WE'VE HEARD A LOT ABOUT THE MISSION TO BUILD A HIGH SPEED TRAIN AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. THAT IS NOT. I MEAN A HIGH SPEED SYSTEM IS THE WAY I VIEW THAT NOT A HIGH SPEED TRAIN ANYWHERE TO ANYWHERE. BUT HIGH SPEED SYSTEM THAT WORKS AND IT MAY TAKE A DIFFERENT BUILDING BLOCK APPROACH BUT IN OUR CHARGE IN THE IN THE ACTUAL- THE STATUES. SELECTING CORRIDORS OR USABLE SEGMENTS THERE OF FOR CONSTRUCTION THE OCEAN AUTHORITY SHALL GIVE PRIORITY TO THOSE CAR DOORS ARE USABLE SEGMENTS. THAT ARE EXPECTED TO REQUIRE THE LEAST AMOUNT OF BOND FUNDS AS A PERCENTAGE OF TOTAL COST OF CONSTRUCTION. WE'RE TOLD TO LEVERAGE MONEY. THAT MEANS LOCAL MONEY FEDERAL MONEY ANY MONEY PRIVATE MONEY- FIRST ABSENT PRIORITIES INITIATING CONSTRUCTION ON CAR DOORS OR USE USABLE SEGMENTS. SO BACK TO THE GOALS. AND I'M GONNA SAY TRACKING PRIVATE SECTOR INVESTMENT IS ONE OF THEM BUT WE HAVE BEEN VERY SUCCESSFUL BUT WE'RE LOOKING AT IT- BUT SIGNIFICANT SIGNIFICANTLY ADDRESSING THE GOVERNOR'S EXECUTIVE ORDER THEY CAME OUT WITH RECENTLY AT THE QUOTE INDUCED GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS AND MITIGATE THE IMPACTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE WHILE BUILDING A SUSTAINABLE INCLUSIVE ECONOMY. THAT MEANS LOOKING AT THE PACKAGE HOLISTICALLY WHERE IS THE BEST VALUE FOR GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS FOR INSTANCE. IT NO DOUBT THE VALLEY NEEDS HELP THERE BUT AS ASSEMBLYMAN FRIEDMAN ALSO SAID THERE'S PLACES IN LOS ANGELES THAT ARE AS BAD IF NOT WORSE THAN THE CENTRAL VALLEY AND IF WE CAN INCREASE RIDERSHIP IN THOSE CAR DOORS AT THE SAME TIME WE WILL BE DOING A BETTER JOB OVERALL I'M GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS WHICH I THINK IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT. IF WE ARE TO MAXIMIZE THOSE GOALS WE SHOULD LOOK AT OPTIONS. I DON'T HAVE THE FUNDS TO BUILD A TUNNEL BETWEEN THE VALLEY. AND THE BAY AREA OR SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA THIS IS THE FUNDAMENTAL QUESTION. AND I BELIEVE WE ARE UNLIKELY TO COMPLETE ANY TUNNEL IN LESS THAN FIFTEEN OR TWENTY YEARS. IN MY OPINION UNTIL WE HAVE TUNNELS IN EITHER DIRECTION. BUILDING CATENARY IS MAINTENANCE FACILITIES AND I HIGH SPEED TRAINS IS UNNECESSARY. CONSIDERING ADVANCES IN HIGH SPEED TECHNOLOGY WHICH I HOPE WE MAY HEAR ABOUT TODAY IT MAY EVEN BE PREMATURE. UNTIL THAT TIME WE SHOULD WORK WITH OUR PARTNERS. ADDRESSING THE ISSUES THAT WERE BROUGHT UP HERE TODAY X. AMTRAK SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA METROLINK VERY CRITICAL THEY CAN HELP ANSWER THOSE QUESTIONS BECAUSE THEY KNOW THE COMMUNITIES A LOT BETTER THAN HIGH SPEED RAIL COMING IN. WE SHOULD WORK WITH THEM NOW TO BILL AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE IN HIGH SPEED RAIL CORRIDORS WITH THE MONEY WE HAVE. THIRTEEN BILLION INVESTED IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY. AND SMALLER MUCH SMALLER TARGETED AND LOCALLY MATCHED INVESTMENT IN THE BALKANS. IT THAT WAY IT'S POSSIBLE WE COULD HAVE THREE USABLE SEGMENTS THAT BENEFIT ALL CALIFORNIANS DELIVER BENEFITS TO THE PUBLIC EARLIER RATHER THAN LATER. THERE IS NO DOUBT OF ONE THING THE CENTRAL VALLEY WILL HAVE A VASTLY IMPROVED RAIL TRANSIT THAT WILL OPERATE AT LEAST AT A HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE MILES AN HOUR. HOPEFULLY IN A ONE SEAT RIDE IF WE CAN JUST ARE THINKING PERHAPS WE CAN DO SOONER. AND AT LESS COST. THANK YOU. IF I MAY I'M GOING TO ASK- DIRECTOR KELLY DID COME FORWARD IF YOU WANT TO RESPOND TO SOME OF THE QUESTIONS BUT- I MAY START BY SAYING IT'S A BIT DISINGENUOUS TO QUOTE PART OF THE OP ED AND NOT. TO LOOK AT THE REST OF THE WORDS. GOVERNOR NEW SOME USED WITHIN THAT THAT AND TORREI OPEN AS HE WAS CLEAR ABOUT HIS INTENTIONS- I WOULD ALSO SAY THAT THOSE OF US WHO VOTED FOR CAP AND TRADE. DIDN'T VOTE FOR IT TO WORK ON HIGHER SPEED RAIL AND AMTRAK WE VOTED ON IT TO ENSURE THAT WE COULD DELIVER HIGH SPEED RAIL FOR OUR COMMUNITIES. WITH THAT I'D LIKE TO ASK DIRECTOR KELLY. IT IS A QUESTION OF THAT I MIGHT ADDRESS ON THAT- BECAUSE I'D LIKE TO RESPOND. I WILL ALLOW TIME BUT SURE STILL HAVE DIRECTOR CAN. WELL THERE'S BEEN A LOT SAID I WAS EVEN QUOTED IN THE END OF THE TABLE SO I MIGHT. KNOW RESPONDED THAT- LOOK CONNECTIVITY IS A KEY POINT OF WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO HERE LET'S BE REALLY CLEAR. THE BOND BILL SAID BUILD A HIGH SPEED RAIL SYSTEM THAT CONNECTS THE CENTRAL VALLEY. AREA IN THE LOS ANGELES BASIN. HIGH SPEED IS DEFINED IN THE LAW. TO MILES PER HOUR MORE NINE HUNDRED SEVENTY MILES IN THE VALLEY. NOT ONE TEN AND I WANT TWENTY FIVE. THAT'S IN THE LAW TODAY. SO THAT IS WHAT WE ARE INTENDING TO BILL. UNLIKE ANY OTHER REGION OF THE STATE RIGHT NOW. AND THE DECISION THAT WE DO NOT MAKE YOUR ALONE. BUT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT'S TO GET STARTED SOMEWHERE THEY SAID GET STARTED IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY. SO THIS IS THE ONLY REGION IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WE ARE HUNDRED NINETY MILES. INTO CONSTRUCTION. SO THE QUESTION IS. DO WE FINISH THAT CONSTRUCTION AND HAVE A LINE FROM MADERA TO POPLAR AVENUE. IN THE MIDDLE OF AN ORCHARD. WHERE DO WE EXTENDED TO CONNECT THREE THE FASTEST GROWING CITIES. IN THREE OF THE FASTEST GROWING COUNTIES IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. MERCED FRESNO BAKERSFIELD. WITH HIGH SPEED RAIL THAT IS CONNECTED. TO AN EXPANDED A SYSTEM THAT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA LEGISLATURE RESPONDING. TO THE TUNE OF ALMOST A BILLION DOLLARS. ETS EXTENSION NUMBER SAID- AND. THE SAN JOAQUIN'S LINE TO OAKLAND. AND SACK. MY VIEW IS YES I KNOW I'M CERTAINLY NOT OF NOT A- SHY ADVOCATE A WHAT I'M RECOMMENDING TO MY BOARD. YOU KNOW I HAVE A HUNDRED NINETY MILES IN A CONSTRUCTION NOW. AND WHEN WE LEAVE THE VALLEY. I'M GONNA LEAVE THE VALLEY WITH VALUE. AND THAT DOES NOT MEAN A LINE. THAT IS NOT OPERABLE. AND I WANNA BE REALLY CLEAR. WE DIDN'T CHOOSE THIS OFF THE TOP OF OUR HEADS. WE WERE VERY CLEAR IN THE TWENTY EIGHTEEN BUSINESS PLAN. THAT BECAUSE WE HAD FUNDING CONSTRAINTS WE WERE GOING TO ASK OUR EARLY TRAIN OPERATOR TO LOOK AT OPTIONS AND GIVE US ADVICE. IN KNOWING THAT WE STARTED WITH A HUNDRED NINETY MILES AN ABOUT. THEY TOOK A LOOK AT THAT AND THEY SAID. THE BEST LINE YOU CAN DO IN THE VALUES IN IN A ROOM SERVICE MATTER. IS MERCED FRESNO BAKERSFIELD. THAT'S WHY WE ARE PURSUING THIS. ON THE RIDERSHIP QUESTION THERE'S NO QUESTION. THAT RIDERSHIP GROWTH IS KEY. UNDER THE EARLY TRAIN OPERATOR ANALYSIS THAT WE GOT BACK IN OUR PROJECT UPDATE REPORT WE'RE DOUBLING THE RIDERSHIP. IN THE VALLEY. DOUBLING THE RIDERSHIP. WE'RE EXPANDING THE NUMBER OF TRAINS THAT CAN BE DONE. BUT I CAN OPERATE ON THIS LINE. WE'RE DOING IT QUICKER AND WE'RE DOUBLING THE RIDERSHIP. SO THEY ARE NOW GOING THROUGH A PROCESS TO WERE LOOK AT THOSE NUMBERS. REFINE THEM THEY'LL COME BACK TO MY BOARD WAS- A SPECIFIC RECOMMENDATIONS. I GUESS MY LAST COMMENT IS JUST THIS. IS SAD WERE HAVING A CONVERSATION THE WAY WE'RE HAVIN IS DANNY'S DISAPPOINTED THAT THE- THE SUGGEST THERE'S- YOU KNOW THERE'S DIVIDE BETWEEN PEOPLE WHO SEE THE WORLD THE SAME WAY. I GUESS I THINK IT'S UNFORTUNATE TO. THE IDEA TO DIVERT MONEY FROM WHAT WE'RE DOING NOW AND SPEND IT ON REGIONAL SERVICES TO ME. IS NOT CONSISTENT WITH THE MISSION OF HIGH SPEED RAIL THAT'S MY VIEW. DAN IT'S GOT A DIFFERENT ONE I THINK IT'S A GOOD IDEA. TO HAVE A CONVERSATION TO FIGURE OUT WHAT YOU WANT TO BE LEFT WITHIN CITY CALIFORNIA WHAT I THINK WOULD BE A TRAGEDY. IS IT DIVIDE THE DIVERTED THE MONEY TO OTHER PLACES. AND YOU'RE LEFT WITH GOVERNMENTAL SPEED. IMPROVEMENTS ON LARGELY DIESEL SIR. AT THE END OF INVESTING THAT MONEY ELSEWHERE. AND A HUNDRED NINETY MILE LINE BETWEEN MADERA IN POPLAR. SITTING IN THE VALLEY. THAT'S WHAT I THINK WOULD BE TRAGIC. AND SO MY VIEW IS. GET THE HIGH SPEED ELECTRIFIED RAIL GOING FINISHER ENVIRONMENTAL WORK. AND THEN WORK ON FUNDING THE GAPS. IN THE LA BASIN INTO THE BAY AREA. AND WITH THE EMERGENCE OF A PRIVATE TRAIN. OPERATOR DEMONSTRATE INTEREST SELECT A FIVE SPEED RAIL TODAY. WE PROBABLY GOT HAD TO DO THAT. THAT'S A BETTER CONVERSATION LATER CERTAINLY THE ONE RIGHT NOW. SO IF I MAKE- I THINK WE'RE GONNA HOPEFULLY HEAR FROM THE- PARTNERS WHO WILL ADDRESS SOME OF THESE QUESTIONS. BUT I THINK- BRIAN POINTED OUT TO THE US FOR STAND HE SHE PRETTY CLEAR TO ME. AND I WILL READ FROM THE EDITORIAL FOR A SECOND- IT'S SIMILARLY TAKING MONEY FROM THE HIGH SPEED RAIL PROJECT. AND DIVERTED TO RAIL SYSTEMS IN THEIR READ. THAT'S THE EDITORIAL FACT OF THE MATTER IS AND WE'RE NOT DIVERTING IT FROM HI FI RAIL PROJECT TO PUT IT INTO OTHER TRAIN OPERATION IF THERE IS ANY DIVERSION IT'S GOING TO HIGH SPEED RAIL TRACK THAT WE JUST LIKE THERE IS IN THE BALLOT. THESE ARE TRACKS THAT WILL HAVE TO BE BUILT THERE ON OUR CAR DOORS SO TO IMPLY THAT IT'S SIMPLY TAKING MONEY FROM HERE TO PUT IT OVER THERE AT THE EXPENSE OF HIGH SPEED RAIL THE FUNDAMENTAL ISSUES AND IT WAS ABOUT IS OUR CHARGE TO GET A HIGH SPEED TRAIN UP AS SOON AS POSSIBLE OR IS THE BILL THE SYSTEM THE BEST WE CAN UNTIL WE CAN GET A HIGH SPEED SYSTEM WELL. THAT'S A FUNDAMENTAL DIFFERENCE OF OPINION AND YOU KNOW WE'RE TALKING ABOUT NOT A STRANDED ASSETS AGAIN THAT'S THE US VERSUS THEM. IT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT A COMPLETE SYSTEM IN THE VALLEY THAT WILL GET YOU TO THE BAY AREA. OR SACRAMENTO ON A ONE RIDE ON A TRAIN THAT CAN GO ON AND TWENTY FIVE MILES AN HOUR. NOT A PODIUM TRAINING FROM OF WHATEVER FIELD HE SAID TO ANOTHER PLACE THAT IS NOT THE OPTION WE'RE NOT HAVING THE REAL CONVERSATION ABOUT THAT OPTION. IF WE CHOOSE THAT OPTION OR IF WE CHOOSE ONE OF THESE OPTIONS IT DOES PRESENT POTENTIAL FOR MORE MONEY TO BE INVESTED INVESTED ON OUR CAR DOORS. TO DO THE THINGS WE NEED TO DO. ANYWAY TO GET A HIGH SPEED RAIL SYSTEM UP AND I WANT TO MAKE ONE POINT. ABOUT THE FOR THE SPEED. THERE'S NO WAY A HIGH SPEED TRAIN AND SO THE CALIFORNIA OR IN THE BAY AREA IT'S GOING TO TWO HUNDRED MILES AN HOUR. PERIOD END OF DISCUSSION A HUNDRED TEN TWO HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE I BELIEVE IS THE MAXIMUM POSSIBILITY. THE ONLY PLACE THAT IS IN THE VALLEY. YES WE COULD BUILD THAT AND ZOOM UP AND. DOWN BUT WE WOULD BE BETTER OFF CONNECTING TO EIGHT. A SYSTEM THAT CAN RUN AT A HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE MILES AN HOUR. AND MAKE IT BETTER CAN ACTIVITY AND BUILD RIDERSHIP. BUT THAT IS THE DIFFERENCE OF OPINION. IF I MAY THE IBM OR PROP ONE A WAS VERY CLEAR ABOUT NEEDING A TRUCK CAM THAT RUNS TWO HUNDRED MILES PER HOUR BUT LOST. SO IF WE ARE UNABLE TO BUILD THIS CENTRAL ABOUT THE SECTION WE ARE UNABLE TO THEN MEET. THE REQUIREMENTS OF PROP ONE ATTY AND UNFORTUNATELY I DON'T LIKE TELLING VOTERS WHEN THEY TOLD US QUITE SPECIFICALLY. WHAT THEY WANTED FROM US SO THAT WE ARE CHANGING PLANS. SO DO YOU THINK THE VOTERS TOLD YOU TO BUILD A HIGH SPEED TRAIN. NO MATTER WHERE NO MATTER WHY BECAUSE WE WANT TO SEE HIGHS BE RETRAIN. OR THEY WANT TO BUILD A HIGH SPEED TRAIN SYSTEM AND GET THE MOST BENEFITS OUT OF BUILDING THAT SYSTEM. FROM NOW UNTIL WE COMPLETED. THAT'S THE FUNDAMENTAL QUESTION IN MY OPENING STATEMENT SITE REFERENCE WHAT PROP ONE A SPECIFIC. ASKED US TO DO THAT'S WHAT I BELIEVE THE VOTERS WANT US. TO DO. AND I THINK THAT'S WHAT WE NEED TO CONTINUE TO FOLLOW. MISTER JIM. YOU KNOW I THINK THE- IT'S A FOR THIS IS A THIS OR THAT CONVERSATION BECAUSE. I THINK THE KEY IS WE KNOW NOW IS WE HAVE A FINITE BUDGET BEFORE US HERE HIGH SPEED RAIL AUTHORITY OF MY BUDGET A MISSION IN THE LAW ABOUT WHAT WE'RE SUPPOSED TO CONTROL AND- BUT WE HAVE THE CAPABILITY TO DO. THINGS IMPORTANTLY HUNDRED SEVENTY ONE MILES IS NOT A CHUMP CHANGE. ROUTE THAT'S A PRETTY LOW ON THE HIGH SPEED RAIL ROUTE GET STARTED IT IS THE BEGINNING NOT THE END BUT WE START THAT WE FINISH THE ENVIRONMENTAL WORK. ALL THE WAY FROM SAN FRANCISCO. I IN ANAHEIM AND THEN YOU WORK ON THE FUNDING APPS AGAIN YOU HAVE THE EMERGENCE OF A PRIVATE ELECTRIFIED HIGH SPEED RAIL OPERATOR. NOW ENTERING THE LA BASIN FROM THE EAST AND- MAKING THE SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA- BASIN AN INTERESTING PLACE TO CONSIDER HOW WE MOVE FORWARD TOGETHER. BOTH THE STATE IN A PRIVATE PRIVATE PARTNER. I'D ALSO SAY THERE ARE A LOT OF REVENUE STREAMS OUT THERE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA- BETWEEN CAP AND TRADE AND OTHER THINGS. IN IT YOU KNOW THE ISSUE IS HOW BIG IS THE PIE- RIGHT NOW I'VE GOT A VERY CONSTRAINED PIE THAT I'M WORKING ON- BUT THERE ARE. OTHER CAP AND TRADE PROGRAMS- AND- THE IDEA OF UTILIZING SOME OF THESE THINGS SO THAT WE CAN DO MORE CONCURRENT INVESTMENTS- IN THIS AREA SO THAT WE CAN BOTH- CONSTRUCT WHAT WE WANT TO CONSTRUCT IN THE VALLEY. AND FORD EXPANDING REGIONAL SERVICES IN THE LA BASIN AND THE BAY AREA. I THINK THERE'S A POTENTIAL THERE I THINK THE QUESTION IS HOW CAN UTILIZE CAP AND TRADE DOLLARS BEYOND WHAT'S DEDICATED TO US. TO DO THAT. I THINK WHAT WE REACT TO IS THE IDEA WE SHOULD TAKE IT FROM THERE AND SPEND IT THERE AND THAT'S WHAT WOULD I THINK WE'RE PUSHING BACK I THINK. THE IDEA THOUGH THAT WE CAN. LOOK AT A BROAD. REVENUE SOURCE IN CALIFORNIA AND FIGURE OUT. HOW CAN WE BEST UTILIZE THIS TO CHIEF COLLECTIVE OBJECTIVES. I HEARD ASSEMBLY WOMAN FRIEDMAN SAY EARLIER. YOU KNOW SHE WANTS TO RIDE THE HIGH SPEED RAIL TRAIL. I WANTED TO RIDE THE HIGH SPEED ROTARY. SHE ALSO WANTS IMPROVEMENTS ON. THOSE THE MORE TRADITIONAL SERVICES IN- IN OUR REGION I WANT THOSE IMPROVEMENTS TO. AND I AM CONVINCED. THAT WHEN THE SPINE SYSTEM THAT DOES GO FAST. CONNECTION THOSE REGIONAL AREAS IT WILL LIFT RIDERSHIP ON ALL OF. THE BECAUSE THAT'S BEEN THE EXPERIENCE AROUND THE GLOBE. WHEN YOU TAKE A HIGH SPEED TRAIN FROM ONE CITY TO ANOTHER. AND YOU GET IN THAT CITY WITH THE CONNECTED TRAIN STATION. PEOPLE TEND TO GET OFF THAT AND USE LOCAL TRENDS. AND THAT'S WHAT WE LIKE TO SEE REPEATED HERE IN CALIFORNIA. SO IT'S A HEALTHY ROBUST CONVERSATION. I DON'T FEEL LIKE WE'RE ON THE- OPPOSITE SIDES OF WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE AT THE END IT'S KINDA HOW WE GET THERE. AND I THINK MAYBE WE OUGHT TO LOOK AT HOW THAT PIE COULD BE EXPANDED AND UTILIZED. AS OPPOSED. TO TALK A WAR BETWEEN REVENUES BETWEEN DIFFERENT ENTITIES. SOMEONE FRIEDMAN ANY QUESTIONS BEFORE WE MOVE ON TO HELEN CURSED. WELL FIRST I AM REALLY ENJOYING- THE CONVERSATION. UHHUH MMHM I IS JUST REMIND EVERYONE YOU TALK ABOUT PROP ONE A ALSO IT WAS VERY SPECIFIC THE PUT THE VOTERS AS A CONNECTION BETWEEN SAN FRANCISCO AND LOS ANGELES IT'S NOT A CONNECTION BETWEEN PARTS OF THE CENTRAL VALLEY IS A MUCH IS THAT'S IMPORTANT TO THE SYSTEM AND WE HAVE TO KEEP THAT IN MIND. AND THE RESTRICTION ABOUT THE HIGH SPEED PART AS FAR AS I KNOW WAS ON THE BOND SECTION ON THE CAP AND TRADE SECTION WHICH IS A MUCH LARGER. PORTION OF THE FUNDING SO I THINK WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT WE SAID WE'RE GOING TO SPEND THE MONEY ON ONE THING AND NOW WE'RE TAKING IT TO SOMETHING ELSE NO NOBODY IS SUGGESTING USING IT FOR SOMETHING ELSE EVERYBODY IS SAYING HOW DO WE DO WITH THE VOTERS ASSETS TO DO WHICH IS TO BUILD HIGH SPEED SERVICE AFFECTED TRAIN SERVICE. BETWEEN SAN FRANCISCO AND LOS ANGELES AND DO IT IN A WAY THAT BRINGS US CLOSER TO THAT VISION OF BEING ABLE TO GET ON A TRAIN. AT UNION STATION OR BURBANK. TO GO TO SAN DIEGO BUT AT LEAST FOR PROP ONE IS PURPOSE. AND NORTH. OF AND THE QUESTION IS DO WE DO THAT BEST BUY STICKING THE COURSE AND DOING THAT. TRUE HIGH SPEED SERVICE. BETWEEN THE AREAS THAT WE HAVE IT UNDER CONCERNED- CONSTRUCTION OR DO WE- SPREAD THE MONEY FURTHER UP AND DOWN THAT LINE WHICH WAS THE GOAL THAT WHOLE LINE. AND GET MORE GET THAT MIND WORKING AS EFFICIENTLY AS POSSIBLE AND THEN- COMPLETE THE PROJECT AND I DON'T THINK THAT PUTS US ON OTHER SITES I DON'T THINK THAT'S ABOUT MOVING MONEY FROM ONE REGION TO ANOTHER AND CHANGING THAT EXPERIENCE I WANT THE PEOPLE IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY. TO GET ON THE TRAIN AND TO DO THAT THEY HAVE TO HAVE THE BEST AND MOST SEAMLESS TRAIN EXPERIENCE AND I AM CONCERNED ABOUT WHAT MR CURTAIN POINTS OUT ABOUT HAVING TO CHANGE TRAINS AS SOMEONE WHO'S- HAD TO CHANGE ON A LOT OF TRAINS TO DEAL WITH THE STROLLER AND A BACK AN INFANT. THAT MAKES YOU THINK TWICE ABOUT DOING IT. AND SO I THINK WE ALL NEED TO THINK ABOUT WHAT THOSE SPEEDS ARE WHAT WILL REALLY INCREASE RIDERSHIP AND JUST SAY IF WE DO THIS WE DOUBLE THE RIDERSHIP WELL WHAT ARE WE COMPARING THAT TO WE'RE OBVIOUSLY NOT DOING NOTHING YOU'RE ON. INSTRUCTION WE WANT THAT CONSTRUCTION TO BE COMPLETED NO ONE IS TALKING ABOUT WALKING AWAY FROM THAT. HAVING A- BRAIN THAT'S SEPARATE HAVING PASSENGER TRAIN THAT SEPARATE FROM. RAIL TRAIN IS VERY IMPORTANT MAKING THESE IMPROVEMENTS IS IMPORTANT BUT HOW DO WE HAVE A- EXPERIENCE THAT GETS THE MOST PEOPLE ON TO THE TRAIN. IS WHAT I'M GOING TO CONTINUE TO ASK ABOUT AND WHAT IS THE- BASS LINE YOU'RE COMPARING IT TO AND NO ONE IS. I'VE HEARD PEOPLE SAY WE WERE BANNED IN THIS PROJECT I DON'T THINK ANYONE'S TALKING ABOUT WALKING WHEN ABANDONING ANY OF THE INVESTMENTS. THAT BEEN MADE OR STOPPING ANY THOSE INVESTMENTS. SO IF I MAY THOUGH I MEAN. HERE WE STAND AT WHERE THE HIGH RAIL STATION WILL BE AND- INTO A KNOWLEDGE THAT ARE. RAIL LINE IS ROUGHLY A MILE PLUS FROM HERE. IT WILL BE THROWAWAY COSTS IF WHAT YOU ARE SUGGESTING NEEDS TO BE FOLLOWED. SO I THINK THERE IS QUITE A BIT OF DISCUSSION THAT NEEDS TO BE HAD BEFORE YOU GUYS. SEAMLESSLY SAY THAT THERE'S A TRANSITION TO DIESEL. OR THAT THAT'S EVEN A CONVERSATION THAT NEEDS TO BE HAD IN THIS MOMENT. I THINK WE'VE HAD THIS CONVERSATION BEFORE AND IT'S ROBBING PETER TO PAY PAUL. AND I THINK WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE CAN DELIVER ON A PROJECT AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. AND WOULD LIKE. THAT TO BE THE FOCUS OF WHERE WE GET. LET ME JUST ASK MISTER CURTAIN I MEAN WHAT WHAT WOULD WE PIECE OF THROWING I MEAN WHAT. I THINK THAT WERE VERY DIFFERENT THINGS ABOUT WHAT PEOPLE ARE INVESTING WHAT THE SUGGESTION IS. I'M NOT SURE. FIRST OF ALL I REALLY WOULD LIKE TO HEAR FROM SOME OF THE OTHERS ON THIS BUT I'M NOT SURE WHAT REFERENCE TO THROWING WAY COST YOU MAY HAVE COMPARED TO THE SORT OF ENGINEERING- THE TRACKING SYSTEMS ISSUES UP THIS IS MADE OF VERY VERY COSTLY PROJECT- AS AGAIN ASSEMBLY WOMAN FRIEDMAN SAID IT'S BEEN RARE THAT WE HAVE DONE- NOT USED ALL OF THE CONTINGENCIES ON OUR COSTS THERE ARE CONSTANT PROBLEMS. THE REAL ISSUE IS WHAT'S THE BEST INVESTMENT USE OF OUR MONEY THEY AMOUNT WE HAVE WILL BE THE BEST RETURN FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA OF COURSE IT WILL BE THROWN AWAY COST I THINK YOU'LL BE THROWING COST EITHER WAY YOU GO- YOU KNOW YOU CAN ELECTRIFY STE- TRACKS THAT ARE NOT ELECTRIFIED THEY'RE DOING IT IN THE PENINSULA. IT'S WHETHER YOU DO IT NOW AND YOU PUT THAT OUT FOR COSTS TEN OR FIFTEEN YEARS BEFORE YOU NEED ELECTRIC TRAIN TO PROVE THAT YOU CAN DO IT THAT JUST DOESN'T MAKE SENSE TO ME THAT THAT WILL NOT ATTRACT INVESTORS THAT WILL MAKE INVESTORS THINK THEY STILL HAVEN'T GOTTEN TOGETHER ABOUT HOW TO BUILD THE TRAIN TERMS TO GET PEOPLE ON THAT TRACK THAT'S THE WAY I VIEW NO MATTER OTHER PEOPLE. INCLUDING THE GOVERNOR MAY HAVE A DIFFERENT VIEW. CERTAINLY DIDN'T COME HERE TO HAVE A CONVERSATION WITH THE GOVERNOR'S COMMENTS. I READ THIS IN FACT IN THE FRESNO BEE. IT WAS A LITTLE DISTURBING I THINK THEY MISSED CHARACTERIZED THE REAL ISSUES HERE. SO AGAIN WE COULD GO BACK AND FORTH AND- CHARM AS- SHE- KELLY AND I. COULD DO THIS FOR A WHILE- AND I'M ASSUMING WE CAN ALL DO THAT BUT I'D- I'D REALLY LIKE TO HEAR FROM. MY MOTHER'S HAPPY TO MOVE FORWARD. HELLO CHRISTY. HEARING MEMBERS THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR INVITING ME TO SPEAK TO YOU TODAY I HAVE THREE MAIN POINTS I WANT TO DISCOVER VERY QUICKLY I. AM OF THEM HAVE BEEN TOUCHED ON BY PREVIOUS SPEAKERS AT ONE OF THE LABOR THEM TOO MUCH. I THE FIRST ONE IS REALLY ABOUT THE PROJECTS FUNDING SITUATION SO AS YOU KNOW THAT YOU'VE HEARD FROM SOME OF THE OTHER- PENALIZED- THE PROJECT DOES FACE A SIGNIFICANT FUNDING GAP SO RIGHT NOW THE AUTHORITIES ESTIMATING IT. WILL HAVE APPROXIMATELY THE AMOUNT TO DO THE MERCED TO BAKERSFIELD MINE- BUT WE'RE ABOUT PROBABLY BY THEIR ESTIMATES ABOUT SIXTY BILLION SHORTEN THE FULL PHASE ONE. SO I THERE IS THERE IS REFERENCE THAT MAYBE THERE COULD BE TAPPING INTO SOME ADDITIONAL FUNDS BUT AT THIS POINT IT'S UNCLEAR WHERE THOSE WOULD COME FROM- AND WE DO KNOW THAT THERE IS A RISK THAT THIS FUNDING GAP COULD GROW- THIS PROJECT HAS EXPERIENCED- FIND- COST INCREASES IN THE PAST AS YOU'VE HEARD. US SO THAT COULD BE A PROBLEM AS WELL IS. THERE SOME UNCERTAINTY ABOUT THE FEDERAL FUNDS- WE TALKED A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THAT- THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS HAS- RAISE THE POSSIBILITY OF WITHHOLDING- THERE ARE THREE. POINT FIVE BILLION AND RE SENDING SENDING THOSE FUNDS. SO THE SECOND MAIN POINT I WANTED TO MAKE- WHICH HAS BEEN TOUCHED ON AS WELL IS THAT. REALLY THE LEGISLATURE HAS. OPTIONS FOR MOVING FORWARD SO CERTAINLY MERCED TO BAKERSFIELD IS ONE I THINK THIS IS A REALLY. VERY HELPFUL IN PRODUCTIVE CONVERSATION TO HAVE ABOUT WHETHER THAT'S THEIR APPROACH THE LEGISLATURE WANTS TO TAKE- OR WHETHER IT WANTS TO FIND SOMETHING ELSE SO WE COULD FIND. A SMALLER. PORTION IS INITIAL CONSTRUCTION SEGMENT TIED IN. WITH YOU A LONGER SECTION- YOU COULD DO ELECTRIFIED. RAIL AS WE TALKED ABOUT YOU COULD DO DIESEL YOU COULD DO SOME OTHER ALTERNATIVE- TECHNOLOGY AS WELL THAT HAD. YOU KNOW THERE'S BEEN PILING. PILOTING OF OTHER TYPES OF TECHNOLOGY SO THERE'S A WIDE RANGE OF THINGS THAT COULD BE CONSIDERED- WE THINK THAT THOSE CONVERSATIONS ARE REALLY PRODUCTIVE MANNER AND ARE VERY HAPPY THAT THE- THAT THEY'RE TAKING PLACE. AND THEN THE FINAL POINT I JUST WANT TO MAKE IS THAT. WE THINK THIS IS REALLY A CRITICAL DECISION POINT FOR THE LEGISLATURE- I SET. LEGISLATURE IS GONNA MOVE FORWARD- AS CURRENTLY PLANNED WE THINK THROUGH THE SOONER THE AUTHORITY HAVE THAT CERTAINTY THE BETTER- AND IF NOT. REALLY MAKING THIS CHOICE NOW RATHER THAN LATER I THINK IS ALSO VERY VALUABLE SO THE AUTHORITY FOR EXAMPLE HAS INDICATED. THAT THEY MAY MOVE FORWARD WITH PROPERTY ACQUISITIONS AS SOON AS NEXT YEAR. ADDITIONALLY THEIR PLANS TO MOVE FORWARD WITH A TRACKING SYSTEMS PROCUREMENT- WE UNDERSTAND IN THE SUMMER. SO THAT WILL BE AT A PRETTY. GET PROCUREMENT WILL INVOLVE PURCHASING. THEY ELECTRIFIED TRACK AND HAVING THAT- THAT CONTRACT IN PLACE. AND ALSO A MAINTENANCE CONTRACT AS PART OF THAT AS- WELL. AND SO FOR EXAMPLE IF THE STATE WERE TO MOVE FORWARD WITH THAT CONTRACT AND IF IT. WERE TO MOVE FORWARD WITH THESE PROPERTY ACQUISITIONS- IT'S GONNA MAKE IT PROBABLY A LITTLE BIT MORE CHALLENGING FOR THE STATE TO. CHANGE COURSE IN THE FUTURE IF THAT. IF THAT DECISION THE LATE LEGISLATURE MAKES AT A FUTURE DATE FOR EXAMPLE. SO WE THINK IT'S REALLY REALLY IMPORTANT REALLY GOOD THAT WE'RE HAVING THESE CONVERSATIONS NOW THEY'RE- NOT EASY CONVERSATION THERE A LOT OF TRADE OFFS AS WE- AS WE DISCUSSED ON. BUT WE THINK IT'S REALLY VALUABLE TO HAVE THIS BACK AND FORTH AND REALLY THINK THROUGH. IS THAT THROUGH THE STATE. THERE ARE PLEASE. CONTACT GETTING THINGS. IN PROP ONE NAY. ASSEMBLY WOMAN FRIEDMAN I APPRECIATE BEING HERE TODAY TO YOU FOR THE INVITATION. I'LL TRY TO BE BRIEF- SAVE TIME FOR QUESTIONS AS WELL I DO WANT TO MAKE A COUPLE OF BRIEF POINTS FIRST. I AM CONCERNED THAT THE HIGH LEVEL OF THIS DISCUSSION WE NOT FORGET THAT WE'VE GOT TO BUILD TRACKS BETWEEN MADERA AND POPLAR AVENUE. THAT IS THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE FEDERAL MONEY AND THAT IS IF WE DO NOT DO THAT EXPOSE OURSELVES TO A REAL LIABILITY- ESPECIALLY IF THE CURRENT ADMINISTRATION. IS REELECTED I THINK THEY WILL DO NO FAVORS TO CALIFORNIA AND IF WE EXPOSE OURSELVES SO BE HAPPY TO HAVE THAT HAPPEN. OF OUR LETTER IN THIS REGARD OUR LETTER OF THE AUGUST THE TWENTY THIRD EXPRESSED A CONCERN ABOUT THE- THE- PROPOSAL BY THE AUTHORITY TO ISSUE A SINGLE CONTRACT IT WILL COVER ESSENTIALLY EVERYTHING FROM. HERE TO SAN FRANCISCO WE THINK THAT POSES A REAL DANGER TO THE SIMPLE JOB OF GETTING THE TRACK WORK DONE. SO THIS SHOULD NOT THEY SHOULD BE CONSIDERED VERY CAREFULLY AND I THINK OF A REAL DELIBERATE DECISIONS SHOULD BE MADE. IN OUR PAST LETTERS IN IN TESTIMONY WE'VE STRESSED TO THE LEGISLATURE THAT YOU HAVE OPTIONS THERE'S NOT JUST ONE CHOICE ON THE TABLE THERE ARE OPTIONS. REALLY RIGHT NOW OF THE TWO OPTIONS THAT YOU'RE LOOKING AT WOULD BE ONE TO HAVE A KIND OF A CONVENTIONAL SYSTEM AND THE CENTRAL VALLEY AND THEN SHIFT MONEY TO THE ENDS. AS OPPOSED TO HAVING THE OF FULL HIGH SPEED SYSTEM FROM MERCED TO OF BAKERSFIELD. ONLINE FOCUSING ON THAT. IN SUMMARY TERMS THE ADVANTAGE OF THE FULLY ELECTRIFIED- APPROACHES THAT YOU YOU WOULD BUILD HIGH SPEED RAIL AND YOU WOULD DEMONSTRATE TRAIN TRAVELING AT HIGH SPEED. OF BUT I THINK IT WOULD BE LESS LOGICAL TO DO THIS ANALYST THIS ALSO IMPLIES A FULL COMMITMENT BY THE STATE TO FINISH THE SYSTEM. IT WOULD NOT MAKE A LOT OF SENSE TO COMMIT TO BUILDING JUST HIGH SPEED RAIL IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY WITHOUT BEING COMMITTED TO GOING ON FROM THERE AND FINISHING THE SYSTEM. AND I WOULD ADD THERE IS NO FUNDING IN PLACE TO DO THAT. IN THIS IS BEEN A REPEATED PROBLEM OF THE PROJECT AND IT IS ONE WHICH REALLY SHOULDN'T BE- SWEPT UNDER THE RUG. THE LEGISLATURE NEEDS TO CONFRONT THIS ISSUE OF IF YOU REALLY ARE GOING TO BUILD A SYSTEM. THEN THE OPTIONS FOR FINANCING THE SYSTEM SHOULD BE EXPLORED IN AND THE DENNIS FIGHT IF YOU CAN. THE ADVANTAGE OF THE OTHER OF PROVED AS IT WOULD PROVIDE IMPROVE SERVICE- AND THE CENTRAL VALLEY OVER WHAT YOU HAVE NOW. BUT AT THE SAME TIME GENERATE LARGE BENEFITS TO THE PASSENGERS ON PATROL LINK AND CALTRAIN IN THE NEAR TERM. THERE WAS ALWAYS THIS QUESTION OF WHETHER YOU SHOULD START AT THE ENDS AND BILL TOWARD THE MIDDLE OR START IN THE MIDDLE AND I DON'T TO WHERE THE ENDS. AND THAT IS STILL THE OPTION THAT'S BEFORE US I THINK THERE'S NO QUESTION BUT WHAT SPENDING MONEY ON THE ENDS GENERATES MORE IMMEDIATE BENEFITS THAN SPENDING MONEY IN THE MIDDLE. IN THE LONG RUN IT DOESN'T MATTER AS LONG AS YOU'RE COMMITTED TO FINISHING THE SYSTEM. IN ANY EVENT THERE ARE UNCERTAINTIES CAN BOTH OPTIONS INCLUDING COST SCHEDULE AND SCOPE THERE IS STILL WIDE RANGE OF VARIATION ON EXPECTED COST. OF TIMES TO COMPLETELY. AND THERE WILL BE WIDE VARIATIONS ON DEMAND FORECAST NO MATTER WHO DOES THEM AND HOW THEY DO. THAT THAT DAY OR AT THE DATA DO NOT EXIST. IN THIS IS A GREEN FIELD SITUATIONS VITAL THAT WE'RE FACING SO. WHERE IS DONE WILL BE SUBJECT TO REAL UNCERTAINTY. ALL I THINK THEREFORE WE SHOULD FOCUS ON THIS FACT THAT IF WE GET THERE ARE WERE DONE ON TIME THERE IS NO REASON TO BE IN A HURRY ABOUT THE OTHER DECISIONS THAT NEED TO BE MADE. WE CAN TAKE OUR TIME WE CAN HAVE THE OPTIONS TO FIND CAREFULLY WE CAN BE SURE THAT THE NUMBERS ARE AS GOOD AS THEY CAN BE. AND WE DON'T HAVE TO DEAL WITH QUALITATIVE ARGUMENTS THAT ALWAYS CONCERNS ME I WANT TO SEE THE BEST ENGINEERING AND THE BEST ECONOMIC ANALYSIS IN QUANTITATIVE TERMS. I WANT ALL IN ONE PLACE BEFORE I WOULD RECOMMEND TO YOU THAT YOU MAKE ANY DECISION AT ALL. THANK YOU MISTER THOMPSON AND I TO LOOK FORWARD TO THE QUANTITATIVE ANALYSIS IF THERE ARE NO QUESTIONS I'D LIKE TO NOW MOVE ON TO MISTER MORTENSEN. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBER FRIEDMAN. THE ETL AND I HAVE A RUNNING JOKE ABOUT THIS PROCESS BECOMING A BEAUTY PAGEANT. AND WE ALWAYS FEEL LIKE WOMEN NOT MIGHT NOT BE THE MOST BEAUTIFUL CONTESTANT WHEN ALL THE- THE SCORES ARE AND- WE HAVE TO MAKE LIGHT OF IT BECAUSE- THE DIFFICULT. LOOKING AT MOVING MONEY AROUND THE STATE AND COMPETING FOR IT AND THAT NONTRADITIONAL WAY THIS ISN'T USUALLY HOW WE GO ABOUT- THE FUNDING PROCESS. I REPRESENT BOTH THE A SERVICE IN THE SAN JOAQUIN SAID MANAGE THESE FOR TWENTY ONE YEARS IN THE SEMI CANS FOR JUST UNDER FIVE. WORK SIDE BY SIDE WITH ALL OF THE CEOS OF THE HIGH SPEED RAIL AUTHORITY SINCE MANY MORE SHOULD WORK SIDE BY SIDE AND FRANKLY OUT RIGHT TALENT THEM AT TIMES. IN FULL DISCLOSURE I VOTED NO ON THE HIGH SPEED RAIL BOND NOT BECAUSE I DIDN'T THINK IT WAS WORTH WHILE. YEAH CAM A TRAFFIC ENGINEER WHO IT WAS MOVED TO REALLY UNDERSTAND THE BENEFITS OF RAIL AND ITS TRANSFORMATIVE NAY- BUT I WORRIED EXACTLY THIS WOULD HAPPEN IN CALIFORNIA WOULD STRUGGLE TO PULL THAT OFF AND- YOU KNOW I GRIND MY HANDS AND HAVE A BATTLE OF CONSCIENCE ALL THE TIME. IN MY ROLE ON THIS ON THE PEER REVIEW GROUP AND THEN AS NOW IN THE SEARCH THIS AND THEN AFTER THE VOTERS DID VOTE FOR IT I FEEL AN OBLIGATION AS A BIRTH CONTROL TO PURSUE THAT EVEN THOUGH. PERSONALLY YOU KNOW I HAD MY DOUBT. IS A WATERSHED PROJECT AND IT WILL MEAN A LOT AROUND THE STATE AND IT NEEDS TO GET BUILT EVERYWHERE IT WAS PLANNED. HOWEVER I'M NOT PLEASE GOTTEN HOW THE AUTHORITY IS GETTING THERE AND SO ARE YOU DO STRUGGLE WITH SOME OF THE OTHER PLAYERS ON THE PANEL. I JUST DON'T THINK THE LARGEST PROJECT OVER TIME SHOULD BE SUCH A ROLLER COASTER RIDE. BACK I CAN REMEMBER NOW THE FIRST TIME WE SWITCHED AND ZIG AND ZAG- MY REGION WAS A LITTLE DISMAYED BECAUSE THE FIRST CONNECTION WAS GOING TO BE BUILT TO SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA BUT DÂN LIVE IN AND I RAMPED UP OUR REGION TO BE EXCITED ABOUT THE- CONNECTION TO SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA FROM THE VALLEY. WAS IMPORTANT IT WAS ONE OF THE TWO. OTHER LEGS OF OUR SCHOOL BAY AREA SACRAMENTO IS ONE SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA IS ANOTHER ECONOMICALLY FOR FAMILY AND SO WE RALLIED AROUND THAT CHOICE AND WE HAD OUR REGION SUPPORT THE HIGH SPEED RAIL AUTHORITY. WITH ZAGGED AGAIN NOW NOT GOING ON SO. TO THE WEST. ILLEGAL PULLED OUR STRAPS UP RIGHT DOWN AND WE GOT EVERYONE TO SUPPORT THAT MOVE BECAUSE IT MIGHT BE OF AFFORDABLE AND WE GET THERE SOONER BUT WITH EVERY ZIG AND ZAG THE PUBLIC CONFIDENCE HAS ERODED AND SO WHEN I GET IT HERE NOW AND HERE YOU KNOW THE REALLY DIFFICULT THIS TENDS WERE HAVING I WORRY ABOUT ANOTHER TURN IN THE DIRECTION AND HOW WE CARRY THIS OUT IF THIS IS THE MODEL WE SAY AGAIN SAG. AT SO MANY TURNS NOT THAT IMPROVE THE RAIL SYSTEM. GREAT FOR THE THEY- LEFT TO ASK FOR THE MONEY FOR THE ACE OF THE SAND ROCK JOAQUIN ROUTES. BUT WE GOT SOME OF THAT SUPPLEMENTAL FUNDING THROUGH THE OTHER STATES SOURCES AND- I'M HOPING AND I WOULD WORK VERY HARD TO MAKE SURE OF THESE. OTHER URBAN PLAYERS ARE FIRST IN LINE FOR SOME OF THESE OTHER RESOURCES. BUT I WORRY THAT IT WOULD VANCE HIGH SPEED RAIL IN THE SAME MANNER AND TO YOUR POINT ABOUT. DO WE HAVE A SPECIFIC GOAL ABOUT THAT I THINK THAT NEEDS TO BE EXPLORED FURTHER. WE HAVE SOME VERY PURIST IDEAS ABOUT HOW TO DO IT. AND THEN INSTEAD OF LIKE A MIDDLE IDEA WE JUMP TO ANOTHER. SIDE I THINK THERE IS A MIDDLE THAT WE COULD GET TO I DO BELIEVE WE DEMONSTRATE HIGH SPEED TRAINS AND DO RUN THREE GRAINS. IT'S NOT ON ALL THE PERSON WHO DOES NOT THE MODEL SOME PEOPLE PREFER. I THINK IT'S POSSIBLE AND I THINK IT'S WORTH EXPLORING IF IT LETS US DO. SOME OF THE OTHER THINGS THAT MIGHT MY COLLEAGUES WOULD LIKE TO SEE. I THINK MERCED IS. A DEAL BREAKER I THINK YOU HAVE TO HAVE ONE OF THE ENDS THIS IS MY PROFESSIONAL OPINION ONE OF THE ENDS OF THE SYSTEM HAS TO BE ROBUSTLY. ACTED I THINK I COULD FUDGE A LITTLE BIT ON. THE SOUTHERN PORTION A LOT OF THAT AS BEST CONNECTION FROM SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. NOT WITHSTANDING THE IMPORTANCE OF MY CITIES IN THE SOUTHERN VALLEY I THINK WE COULD KEEP SOME NON COMPETITIVE SAN JOAQUIN SERVICE FOR THEM. BUT I THINK MERCED. BEING CONNECTED AT THAT JUMPING OFF POINT IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA I THINK THAT'S CRITICAL BE VERY HARD FOR ME TO SUPPORT SOMETHING. THAT DOESN'T HAVE THAT. I THINK ONE OF THE IDEAS WE'VE COME UP WITH. THE EARLY TRAIN OPERATOR IS COMBINING THE SYSTEMS I'M INTRIGUED ABOUT THE VIRGIN CONCEPT AND I HAVE REACHED OUT TO THEM IF THERE'S A WAY TO TAKE. A SAID THIS MY CANS AND WHATEVER OPERATE THIS FIRST SEGMENT AND REGION THE BUSES THAT GO TO. IN CALIFORNIA THERE WE HAD KIDS THAT WITHOUT. A DOUBT. FROM THE PRIVATE SECTOR SOMETHING MUCH MANAGE MORE FUNGIBLE MOVE YOUR PENCIL. REVENUE IS AROUND. THE PROTECTOR HAS EXPRESSED SOME INTEREST BUT THAT TAKES A LOT OF COORDINATION. AND A FULL SECTION BEING BUILT. BUT JUST SAY HAVING SINCE AND WAS PASSED IN AND VERY I AM VERY GOOD MUSCLES FROM WRINGING MY HANDS OVER AND OVER SOMETHING HAS TO CHANGE WE NEED A SERIOUS SERIOUS LOOK AT HOW WE'RE GOING TO GET THERE IT REALLY TAKES A LEGISLATURE TO MAKE A COMMITMENT LUIS RIGHT WE'VE SAID THAT FOR YEARS THERE HAS TO BE A COMMITMENT THAT WE'RE GOING TO DO IT. OR WE END UP IN A PLACE WHERE WE JUST HAVE TO GO TO A BUILDING BLOCK SO I'M I'M HAPPY THAT YOU ASKED FOR MY IMPRESSION IMPRESSION ON THIS ISSUE AND- ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS IF I CAN HELP. YEAH I'M SORRY I DIDN'T UNDERSTAND WHEN YOU SAID BUT- OF- THAT- YOU HAD TO HAVE A JUMPING OFF POINT IN THAT IS A DEAL BREAKER I DON'T UNDERSTAND. WHAT'S THE DEAL BREAKER. I DON'T I I'M SORRY I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT YOUR- POINT I THINK WE'RE SAID FROM THE NORTHERN CALIFORNIA PERSPECTIVE IT IS A PLACE BUT THERE'S A NATIONAL TRANSIT CONNECTIVE ITTY. AND PLANNED INITIAL A BUS SERVICE TO WE'RE STARTING BUS SERVICE TO SAN JOSE FROM MERCED. IN ANTICIPATION OF HIGH SPEED RAIL GETTING THERE. THAT THE A SERVICES GOT THE SAN JOAQUIN JUST GOT A LOT OF THE CONNECTING BUS TO THE COAST AND TO THE YOU SOMEBODY NATIONAL PARK. IF THE JUMPING OFF POINT IS THERE SAID FROM THE FIRST PIECE INSTEAD AND WE'RE LIMITED TO THAT NORTHERN AND- I BELIEVE THEN YOU HAVE TO. AND POINTS OF THE SERVICE GRANTED YOU WOULD HAVE THROUGH TRAINS BUT YOUR PORTIONS. AT HIGHER SPEED. ARE ARE BOTH. LESS AND METROPOLITAN AREAS WITH CONNECTIONS SO I'M SORRY I UNDERSTAND THAT THE MERCED THAT MERCED IMPORTANT BUT WHAT ARE YOU SUGGESTING IN TERMS OF THE TRAINS CAN YOU CAN YOU BRING THIS DOWN A LITTLE BIT FOR ME AS SOMEONE IS NOT A YES I DON'T DO THIS EVERY DAY TO SURE SO IF YOU LOOK AT THE MAP I'M SUGGESTING THE PEACH THAT THE HIGH SPEED RAIL AUTHORITY IS BILL RIGHT NOW ALL THE PEACE THAT THEY CAN. LEAD ON THE NORTHERN AND COMPLETE. MERCED RIGHT. AND THEN AT THE END OF THE SEVENTH. TO BEGIN- MISREAD DEAL BREAKER MEANING THAT IS THAT THE CENTRAL MISS FRIEDMAN I'D MAYBE THIS HELPS OUR CURRENT NORTHERN TERMINATION POINT MADERA. IN SO WHICH IS ADVOCATING IS YOU KNOW A BREAKER FOR HER IS IT'S GOT TO GO TO THE ALL THE WAY TO GO TO SEX RIGHT THAT THE PLACE OF. RIGHT REGARDLESS OF WHETHER IT'S THE TWO HUNDRED MILE AN HOUR TRAIN OR THE HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE MILE AN HOUR YOU WEREN'T A PINING ABOUT THAT JUST OKAY THAT'S WHAT I WASN'T CLEAR THAT MIGHT IT THERE'S VERY LITTLE DISPUTE ABOUT. THAT CONVERSATION IS THIS QUESTION. WHAT'S THE SYSTEM. WITHOUT ALL NOW MOVE ON TO MISS WEEKEND CEO OF NATURAL. GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIR ASSEMBLY MEMBER FRIEDMAN THANK YOU FOR THE INVITATION TO APPEAR BEFORE YOU AT THIS OVERSIGHT OVERSIGHT HEARING. I AM STEPHANIE WE CAN CEO OF THE SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA REGIONAL RAIL AUTHORITY KNOWN AS METROLINK WE OPERATE OVER FIVE HUNDRED THIRTY EIGHT ROUTE MILES AND PROVIDE MOBILITY AND CONNECTIONS TO PEOPLE IN OUR SIX COUNTIES OF LOS ANGELES ORANGE RIVERSIDE SAN BERNARDINO VENTURA AND SAN DIEGO. 85% OF THE WRITERS ON OUR SYSTEM OUR CHOICE WRITERS WHO HAVE ACCESS TO A CAR AND THE AVERAGE TRIP LENGTH IS THIRTY SIX MILES ONE WAY GIVEN THOSE FACTS WE ARE EXCITED TO HAVE ACHIEVED RECORD RIDERSHIP OF ELEVEN POINT NINE MILLION BOARDINGS IN FISCAL YEAR TWENTY NINETEEN. OUR RECORD COMES ON THE HEELS OF FIVE YEARS OF CONSISTENT RIDERSHIP GROWTH AT A TIME WHEN MANY TRANSIT SYSTEMS HAVE PLAYED TOTAL OR SEEN DECLINES ARE RIDERSHIP REPRESENTS A 28% REDUCTION IN TRAFFIC VOLUME DURING PEAK HOURS. THE EQUIVALENT OF TWO PARALLEL FREE PLANES ASK THE SCHOOL YEAR METROLINK REMOVE NINE POINT THREE MILLION CAR TRIPS OFF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA ROADS ELIMINATING OVER A HUNDRED THIRTY THOUSAND METRIC TONS OF GHG EMISSIONS IN OUR AIR BASIN THAT'S THE EQUIVALENT OF CARBON CAPTURED BY A HUNDRED FIFTY THREE THOUSAND ACRES OF FOREST. THE HEALTH OF OUR REGION CAN'T WAIT I STARTED MY TIME THAT LINK WITH A COMMITMENT TO DOUBLE RIDERSHIP IN FIVE YEARS THAT MEANS THAT WE WANT TO ELIMINATE NEARLY TWENTY MILLION CAR TRIPS FROM MARKET TESTED ROADS THE QUESTION IS HOW DO WE GET THERE. FIRST WE ARE INVOLVING OUR CULTURE THE FOCUSING AT LEAST CUSTOMER IN JANUARY I MADE A COMMITMENT TO BRING WIFI TO THINK THAT'S THE MOST WITH THE AMENITY BY WRITERS OF THE DAY EIGHT. JUST WE LAUNCHED OUR FIRST BY FIVE THAT'S TRUE. SHIP WITH EIGHTEEN NO AFTER. THE TO THE BENEFIT MISSION WHO ARE CULTIVATING THE BALL THE WAY WE DO BUSINESS WITH THE CUSTOMER AT THE TOP OF. SECOND WE STARTED IMAGINING CARES PROGRAM TO BETTER HIGHLIGHT THE ENVIRONMENTAL AND SOCIAL IMPACT OF OUR SERVICE THROUGH COMMUNITY FOCUS PARTNERSHIPS WITH ORGANIZATIONS THAT HAVE NOT TRADITIONALLY BEEN A PART OF THE TRANSIT CONVERSATION SUCH AS THE AMERICAN HEART ASSOCIATION. THEY RECOGNIZE WHAT WE ALL KNOW WHICH IS THAT PEOPLE HAVE OVERALL BETTER HEALTH AND IMPROVED QUALITY OF LIFE WHEN THEY WALK MORE AND PEOPLE WALK SIGNIFICANTLY MORE WHEN THEY TAKE THE TRAIN. THIRD WE ARE INVESTING IN OUR SCORE PROGRAM THIS CAPITAL PROGRAM IS MEANT TO TRANSFORM THE MEASURE LIKE SYSTEM BY THE TWENTY TWENTY EIGHT OLYMPIC AND PARALYMPIC GAMES. THROUGH THESE INVESTMENTS WILL FALL FROM THE SYSTEM MOSTLY FOCUSED ON COMMUTE HOURS IN THE PEAK COMMUTE DIRECTION TO ONE WHERE COMMUTERS AND LEISURE TRAVELERS CAN RELY ON US. HAVING TRAINS OPERATING THROUGHOUT THE DAY AND ADDITIONALLY THESE IMPROVEMENTS BENEFIT OUR RAIL PARTNERS LIKE THE STATE SUPPORTED LOS AND SERVICE AND OUR CLASS ONE FREIGHT OPERATORS WHO HELPED FUEL THE ECONOMIC ENGINE OF CALIFORNIA. AND THANKS TO A TRANSIT IN INNER CITY CAPITAL RAIL PROGRAM GRANT FROM CAL STATE WE'RE OFF TO A GREAT START BUT AS WE ALL HOPE MORE IS NEEDED. FINALLY I WANT TO HIGHLIGHT METROLINX ABILITY TO BE A GAME CHANGER FOR AIR QUALITY CONFORMANCE IN THE SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA AIR BASIN. OUR NEAR TERM FUTURE IS ZERO EMISSIONS FUTURE THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF DISCUSSION ABOUT ELECTRIFYING DOORS IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. AND WHILE HIGH SPEED RAIL MAY NEED OVERHEAD CATENARY INFRASTRUCTURE METROLINK DOES NOT. INSTEAD METROLINK NEED AMERICANS A QUICK THAT IS FLEXIBLE SCALABLE TO ALLOW FOR YOU. TO SPEAK BURBANK AND I. OR AND THROUGHOUT. AND IF IT INVEST. TO FUTURE AND RELEASED IN OUR P. TO STUDY RETROFITTING LEGACY DIESEL MODE LOCOMOTIVES WITH ONE OF THE QUICKLY EVOLVING TECHNOLOGIES. ALSO WE ARE WORKING WITH NUMBER AGENCIES AIR RESOURCE AGENCIES AND PUBLIC AND PRIVATE PARTNERS TO ACCELERATE EVALUATION AND DEPLOYMENT OF ZERO EMISSION TECHNOLOGY. THIS WILL MODERNIZE OUR FLEET AND FACILITIES IN THE SHORT AND LONG TERM FOR THE BENEFIT OF CURRENT AND FUTURE GENERATIONS. ALL OF THESE INITIATIVES WILL ACCELERATE METROLINX TRANSFORMATION TO A PREMIER SERVICE THAT CONNECTS THEM IN CALIFORNIA. SO WHEN THE CALIFORNIA HIGH SPEED RAIL AUTHORITY ASKED US TO SHARE INFORMATION ABOUT INVESTMENTS THAT COULD HELP THEIR LONG TERM GOALS RELATED TO NETWORK INTEGRATION AND EARLY INFRASTRUCTURE DELIVERY. WE LOOK AT THE BURBANK TO ANAHEIM CORRIDOR AND ITS IDENTIFICATION IN THEIR TWENTY EIGHTEEN BUSINESS PLAN AS PART OF THE PHASE ONE SYSTEM. METROLINK IN ITS MEMBER AGENCIES ALREADY INVESTING ONE POINT EIGHT BILLION DOLLARS IN THE QUARTER THROUGH OUR CAPITAL PROGRAM. AND THE BURBANK TO ANAHEIM QUARTER CURRENTLY HAS A HUNDRED THIRTY TRAIN MOVEMENTS EACH WEEK WEEK DAY. LOOTING FREIGHT AND PASSENGER TRAINS. SO LET ME BE CLEAR. SHOWING HAS ASKED ABOUT REPROGRAMMING OR MOVING ANY FUNDS WE SIMPLY RESPONDED TO THE HIGH SPEED RAIL AUTHORITIES REQUEST DIED BY THE INVESTMENT NEEDS AND BENEFITS IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. ANY NEW FUNDING WE CAN SECURE FROM THE STATE EIGHT THOUSAND METER LEE LEVERAGE. PROGRAM FDA'S OR CAPACITY POTENTIALLY BLING IN NEW STATE INVESTMENT. THE RESPONSE WE RESPOND THE RESPONSE WE PROVIDED TO THE AUTHORITY. LINES THE BENEFIT AND ASSOCIATED PRODUCTS IN TWO PHASES. TWENTY TWENTY FOUR AND TWENTY TWENTY EIGHT A SIMPLE THEY ARE FULL. AND IT. VISION FOR. THIS FREQUENCY IS AT CONTRACT TIME SAVINGS IN THAT CORRIDOR REPRESENT A COMPELLING OPPORTUNITY TO ATTRACT NEW PASSENGERS. DO G. EMISSIONS. CURRENTLY METROLINK HAS OVER ONE POINT EIGHT MILLION ANNUAL. BOARDINGS ALONG THE BURBANK AND HOW QUARTER OVER TIME. THESE IT. WILL REDUCE THE PASSENGER TRAVEL TIMES BY 22% WELL TRAFFIC CONGESTION IN THE REGION CONTINUES TO GROW GIVING PEOPLE BACK THEIR TIME IS PRICELESS AS ANYONE WHO NEVER GET SOMETHING CALIFORNIA TRAFFIC KNOWS. IN CLOSING WE APPRECIATE YOUR CONSIDERATION AS YOU REVIEW THE BEST WAYS TO ADD VALUE TO THE RAIL TRANSPORTATION NETWORK IN CALIFORNIA. INVESTMENT A METROLINK IS AN INVESTMENT IN OUR SHARE PRIORITIES OF CONGESTION RELIEF IMPROVED AIR QUALITY AND SAFE RELIABLE MOBILITY SOLUTIONS. THESE PRIORITIES ARE FURTHER ARTICULATED BY THE STATE IN SB SEVEN FORTY THREE AND THE GOVERNOR'S RECENT EXECUTIVE ORDER. REDUCING VMC AND REFUSED REDUCING GHG EMISSIONS IS WHAT INVESTING AND MORE RAIL IN CALIFORNIA WILL MEAN. I FIRMLY BELIEVE THAT MORE FUNDING IS NEEDED FOR ALL REGIONS IN THE STATE. THANK YOU FOR INVITING ME TO BE HERE TODAY I WELCOME ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE. THANK YOU MISS WILLIAMSON MISSY OF ASSEMBLYMEMBER FRIEDMAN HAS ANY QUESTIONS IF NOT IN. RESPECT TO THE PUBLIC- TO COME HERE TO TESTIFY. I WILL HAVE DIRECTOR KELLY CLOSE THIS PANEL AND THEN WE WILL TAKE PUBLIC COMMENT. A MINUTE MISTER CHAIRMAN I THINK I JUST SORT OF WRAP UP OUR PERSPECTIVE BY- YOU KNOW NOTING WHERE WE SAID IT MAKES US A LITTLE BIT UNIQUE VERSES BUDDY ELSE AND THAT IS THAT. CALIFORNIA HIGH SPEED RAIL AUTHORITY HAS STRICT FEDERAL REQUIREMENTS THAT WE HAVE TO MEET. A IN TERMS OF WHAT WE DO NEXT IN THE WORK THAT WE HAVE TO GET DONE IN THE NEXT COUPLE OF YEARS WE ARE COMMITTED. TO MEETING THAT THE REQUIREMENTS OF THAT MEANS COMPLETE ALL OF OUR ENVIRONMENTAL WORK. STATEWIDE IN GETTING OUR A HUNDRED NINETY MILES CONSTRUCTED IN THE VALLEY PLUS TRACK- IN THE VALLEY AND THAT IS OUR FIRST PRIORITY- THE QUESTION IS WHAT DO YOU DO WITH AVAILABLE. TO US AFTER THAT. THE VEIL FUNDING TO UP TO THAT WE WITH THOSE. THAT WE DO THE LINK PERCENT WE HAVE A- URBAN LINK AT THE SOUTH END AS WELL IN BAKERSFIELD AND THAT WE GET THAT RUN. GOING ONE OF THE THAT MAKES US UNIQUE VERSES METROLINK BARK OR. CALTRAIN OR LA METRO OR ANY OF THESE OTHER. IS WE DO NOT HAVE ACCESS. TO FUNDING OUTSIDE OF THE FUNDING IT'S DEDICATED US IN THE BOND. WE GOT ZERO OUT OF SB ONE- IN THOUGH THE WERE THOSE FUNDING POTS GROW. THERE ARE YEAH WE HAVE CAP AND TRADE WE'VE GOT A PERCENTAGE OF CAP AND TRADE. THAT WE HAVE BUT ASIDE FROM THOSE POTS- WE GOT WE DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO OTHER FUNDING POTS- IN SO THE PROGRAM LIKE THE D. I. R. C. PRO. P. PROGRAM THAT'S AVAILABLE OTHER TRANSIT ENTITIES. IS MADE UP OF TWO. FUNDING POPS CAP AND TRADE DOLLARS GO TO THE C. T. I. R. C. P. PROGRAM. ASIDE WHAT COMES ASIDE FROM WHAT STYLES. IN SB ONE BOLSTERED THAT PROGRAM AND WE DON'T SEE ANY OF THAT. SO THE ISSUE IS AGAIN- I'M NOT IN IT I'VE NOTICED. WITH THE IMPROVEMENTS. THAT METROLINK WHAT TAKE I THINK THEY'RE GREAT. THEY DID PROVIDE A RESPONSE TO US AT A COST OF ABOUT NINE POINT EIGHT. MILLION DOLLARS FOR A SERIES OF CAPITAL PROJECTS THAT. OVER THE NEXT TEN YEARS. IF YOU DIVERTED EVERY TIME WE HAD JUST LA THAT BE ABOUT HALF OF THAT AMOUNT- AND SO. YOU KNOW RATHER THAN GO DOWN THAT ROAD AGAIN I WOULD HOPE THAT WE CAN FIND A WAY GOING FORWARD- TO HAVE US USE THE REVENUES THAT ARE AVAILABLE FOR US. TO BUILD THE SYSTEM THAT WE ARE REQUIRED TO BUILD AN MANDATED TO. BUILD WITH THE- AND FIND WAYS TO EXPAND OTHER RESOURCES- TO BOTH. EXTEND OUR SYSTEM AND INVEST IN SHARED CORRIDORS WE CAN. I WANT TO EMPHASIZE. THE WEIRD LÀ TOGETHER IN THESE CORRIDORS FOR EXAMPLE I SAID EARLIER ALL OF THE ENVIRONMENTAL WORK THAT'S GOING ON NOW IN THE CORRIDOR BETWEEN BURBANK IN ANAHEIM. TO ADD TO ELECTRIFY PASSENGER TRACKS TO THE CURRENT FREIGHT LÀ. DOWN THERE IS WORK THAT DOESN'T JUST BENEFIT HIGH SPEED RAIL. BENEFIT HIGH SPEED RAIL WILL BENEFIT METROLINK. IT'LL BENEFIT LOS UP. A AND THE SAME IS TRUE IN THE BAY AREA. THE STATE CAN ELECTRIFY THE CALTRAIN SYSTEM ALL THE WAY TO GILROY. AND WE CAN- MAKE OTHER INVESTMENTS- I IN STATION MANAGEMENT- THE DIVERT ON STATION FOR EXAMPLE A MUCH LIKE THE LA UNION STATION IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA IS PROPOSED TO BE UP A MAMMOTH- STATION THAT SERVES ALL KINDS OF PROVIDERS NOT JUST US. SO THERE'S GREAT OPPORTUNITY TO DO THINGS THE OTHER WHAT I'M HOPEFUL IS AT THIS CONVERSATION COULD MOVE FROM LET'S YOU KNOW TAKE MONEY THAT ARE FAIRLY WALLED OFF IN TERMS OF WHO HAS ACCESS TO THEM AND FIND WAYS TO. LOOK AT HOW WE CAN- ENHANCE THAT PIE ROW THAT PIE IN A SURE THAT WE CAN GROW BOTH METROLINX OF THE WORLD AND ALLOWS TO BUILD TRULY ELECTRIFIED HIGH SPEED RAIL THE FIRST STATE IN THE NATION TO DO THAT. AND OUR VISION IS TO GET THAT DONE SO THANK YOU MISTER. WITH THAT I KNOW THIS IS AN ASSEMBLY TRANSPORTATION HEARING BUT TO REFLECT MY COLLEAGUE EX OFFICIO MEMBER ON THE HIGH SPEED RAIL AUTHORITY BOARD. SENATOR PELL HE HAS TALKED ABOUT HOW WE GROW THAT. AND WHETHER OR NOT THERE NEEDS TO BE EXPANSION IS AN IMPORTANT PART OF THE CONVERSATION SO THAT WE CAN ENSURE THAT- ALL SECTIONS OF HIGH SPEED. BUILT WITH THAT I'D LIKE TO ALLOW THE PUBLIC TO COME FORWARD AND MAKE THEIR COMMENTS AND WANT TO THANK THIS PANEL FOR THEIR TESTIMONY WE CAN TRYING KEEP OUR COMMENTS TO A MINUTE THAT WOULD BE APPRECIATED YOU WILL START TO HEAR THE BEEPING ONE THE MINUTE COPS. GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS SAYS WHOSE VARGAS PRESIDENT AND FOUNDER OF THE S. C. A SMALL BUSINESS FOCUSED. ON PROVIDING LOCAL AND STATE GOVERNMENT AGENCIES PROFESSIONAL SERVICES SINCE TWO THOUSAND FOUR. MY DREAM AS A CHILD WAS TO WORK WITH PLANES TRAINS AND AUTOMOBILES I'M LIVING THAT DREAM I'M ALSO REALIZING THE DREAM FOR MANY PEOPLE HAVING HIRED. SEVERAL FOLKS IN THE FAT AND THE VALLEY TO WORK IN TRANSPORTATION PROJECTS. I PLEAD THAT YOU KEEP THE FUNDING IN THE VALLEY. WE HAVE PLANTED MANY SEEDS TO CONTINUE WORKING IN THE VALLEY AS MY FIRM. ON I'M HERE SPEAKING AS A FORMER OWNER. NOT REPRESENTING THE CALIFORNIA HISPANIC CHAMBERS OF COMMERCE NOR THE CONFERENCE MINORITY TRANSPORTATION OFFICIALS NOR A HIGH SPEED RAIL BUSINESS ADVISORY COUNCIL MEMBER OF WHICH WE ORIGINALLY HAD MEETINGS TODAY. I WAS HOPING TO HAVE ANOTHER MINUTE. ON THE INTENT IS TO REQUEST THAT WE KEEP THE PROJECTS GOING SO THAT I WOULD NOT HAVE TO. LET GO OF STAFF THAT WORK FOR THE FIRM THAT WERE HIRED FROM THE VALLEY WE HAVE OVER 35% OF THE OF MY FIRM OF FORTY PEOPLE. THAT ARE FROM THE VALLEY WORKING IN THE VALLEY I'D LIKE TO NOT MOVE THEM. TO THE BAY AREA NOR TO ALL A BECAUSE THAT WILL INCREASE THE M. P. AND WILL CAUSE HARDSHIP ON THEIR FAMILIES. LET'S KEEP THE PROJECT GOING ONE AND BUILD WHAT WE INTENDED TO BUILD A TWO HUNDRED MILE SYSTEM THANK YOU. THANK YOU. I'M DAVID SHOWN BROWN I'M THE VICE PRESIDENT FOR POLICY OF THE AND WRITERS ASSOCIATION. OF CALIFORNIA. WE HAVE- AS AN ORGANIZATION LONG RECOGNIZED CALIFORNIA'S NEED FOR HIGH SPEED RAIL HOWEVER WE HAVE CONSISTENTLY OPPOSED THIS PROJECT BECAUSE THE WRONG PEOPLE DESIGNED IT IF THE PRIVATE SECTOR HAD DONE THE DESIGN YOU WOULD NOW SEE SIGNIFICANT PRIVATE INVESTMENT IN THE PROJECT. THE FACT THAT THERE IS NO PRIVATE INVESTMENT IS CONCLUSIVE EVIDENCE THAT THIS PROJECT VIOLATES BASIC RULES FOR A SUCCESSFUL REAL BUSINESS THIS CEO FOR CHS OUR RATE HAS BEEN QUOTED SAYING COMPLETING THE CENTRAL VALLEY PROJECT WILL DRAW IN PRIVATE INVESTMENT WITH ALL DUE RESPECT. THAT'S PREPOSTEROUS WHAT BUSINESS IS GOING TO INVEST IN A PROJECT THAT CAN ONLY DEMONSTRATE ITS ABILITY TO LOSE MONEY THANK YOU SIR. GOOD AFTERNOON CHECK REAL HAS- THE ELECTED HEAD OF THE FRESNO MADERA TO OUR KINGS BUILDING TRADES COUNCIL THIRTY TWO YEAR MEMBER OF THE I. B. W. I DON'T WANT TO MISS QUOTE OR MISSED INTERPRET WHAT WAS ASKED EARLIER AGAIN YOU KNOW. THERE WAS A LOT OF THINGS THAT COULD BE SAID OVER THE COURSE OF THE LAST COUPLE OF HOURS BUT TO THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER FRIEDMAN COMMENT. BELIEVE QUESTION WHY INVEST IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY SECTION IT DOES A LITTLE BIT TO DO THAT WHAT WE'VE BEEN DOING FOR THE LAST SEVEN YEARS SINCE THE INCEPTION IN THE CONSTRUCTION OF HIGH SPEED RAIL IS PUT ON PRE APPRENTICESHIP CLASSES. SEC PRINTERS OF CLASSES. PREPARES THOSE UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES FOR OPPORTUNITIES AN APPRENTICESHIP. AT THOSE APPRENTICESHIPS ARE GAME CHANGERS THOSE APPRENTICESHIPS ARE TRANSFORMATIVE. SO BRIEFLY THE NUMBERS THAT WE HAVE THE MOST UP TO DATE GOING TO THE TO TWENTY FOURTEEN. AND WE CONTINUE THE WORK TO THE CALIFORNIA WORKFORCE INVESTMENT BOARD. THE FRESNO REGIONAL WORKFORCE INVESTMENT BOARD AND THE MADERA WORKFORCE INVESTMENT BOARD. I HAPPEN TO SIT AS A DIRECTOR ON ALL THREE OF THOSE WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT BOARD'S. SO WE HAVE PUT FOUR HUNDRED AND SEVENTY UNDER SERVED IN HARD TO SERVE COMMUNITY MEMBERS. THROUGH A PRE APPRENTICESHIP TRAINING. BECAUSE OF HIGH SPEED RAIL IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY. OF THE FOUR HUNDRED AND SEVENTY WE HAVE TWENTY TWO PERCENT. BUILDING TRADES APPRENTICESHIP PARTICIPATION. SUNRISE IF YOU CAN TALK I APOLOGIZE THAT THERE'S A LOT TO SAY SO THAT'S A HUNDRED IN A STORY NEW APPRENTICESHIPS IN THE SENATE CENTRAL VALLEY. 81% THREE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY HAVE GONE ON TO JOBS JOB PLACEMENTS SB ONE FUTURE FUNDING. A DEAR DIRAC'S- FIVE MILLION A YEAR EVERY YEAR FOR WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT WE ARE IN PLAY ON THAT WE NEED TO DO THE FRESNO WORKFORCE BOARD. WILL BE. ASKING FOR THOSE FUNDS AS FAR AS BRIEFLY I GOT TWO MORE COMMENTS. RIDERSHIP I KNOW THE COMMENTS WERE ABOUT RIDERSHIP IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY I WAS FORTUNATE TO GO ON TO TRIPS TO EUROPE. BASED ON HIGH SPEED RAIL SEE IN THE RIDERSHIP THERE WAS UNBELIEVABLE ESPECIALLY IN GERMANY. THERE WAS NOT A TRAINED WE GOT ON THAT WASN'T FILLED TO CAPACITY AND THOSE THINGS ARE DEVELOPED OVER TIME AND I GET YOU WANT THAT RIDERSHIP. I HAVE ASKED THOSE QUESTIONS BOTH IN SPAIN AND GERMANY AND THE RIDERSHIP WILL BE THERE I AM FULLY CONFIDENT OF THAT. THE LAST THING IS ONE MORE THING THE MULTIPLIER. WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO DRAW DOWN A LOT OF TRAINING DOLLARS NOT ONLY FROM DC BUT FROM THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. TO CHANGE THOSE EYES AND THE CENTRAL VALLEY BECAUSE OF AYE. WELL I ADVOCATE FINISHING HIGH SPEED RAIL SECTION INVESTORS ARE VALID PLEASE. THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR HAVING IT HERE OPERATE FRAZIER MADERA COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS CHAIRMAN OF THE BOARD THIS YEAR. ASSEMBLYMEMBER FRIEDMAN TO YOUR COMMENTS WITH BRIAN KELLY THE COMMUNICATION HAS BEEN MUCH BETTER SINCE THEN. WE STARTED WE HAVE THE Y. MUSICAL OF THE SPAGHETTI BOWL AND- WITH ALL THE DIFFERENT ALIGNMENTS SINCE HE'S COME IN THERE'S BEEN MUCH MORE DECISIVE- MEANINGFUL- DECISIONS BEING MADE SO. I JUST WANTED TO- TELL MY APPRECIATION FOR THAT- YOU KNOW IF WE CHANGE FROM WHEREVER GOING RIGHT NOW IT NEEDS TO BE FROM BAKERSFIELD- TO MERCED- THEY'VE TALKED ABOUT IT BEING A TRADE TO KNOW WHERE. AND NO OFFENSE TO POP REVENUE AS EVERYONE KNOWS THAT MADERA COUNTY IS A- DESTINATION UNTO ITSELF- AND I THINK YOU FOR ONLY CHORUS LESS THE METROPOLITAN- BUT WE'RE THE CONNECTION THAT. WHICH IS THE GAP FROM SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA TO THE BAY AREA- YEAH THAT'S THAT'S THE BACKBONE THAT'S WERE. WHERE EVERYTHING IS AND I JUST WANT TO SAY WHEN WE LOOK AT THE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS AT THAT POINT. WE HAVE- PEOPLE TRAVELING FROM THE BAY AREA FROM SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA DOWN OUR BACKBONE SUMMER HEAT CAL I ALSO RISE RIGHT NOW THANK YOU- IS THAT LIKE A SUMMARY SOMEONE SOME RIGHT. SO YOU LOOK AT THINK ABOUT WE TALK ABOUT AIRPORTS THINK OF THE PEOPLE MOVERS THEY PLACE THEM IN THE LONGEST CORRIDORS OF THE AIRPORTS TO GET PEOPLE FROM WHERE. THEY NEED TO GO TO WHERE THEY NEED TO GO THAT IS THE CENTRAL VALLEY WE NEED THAT GAP RIGHT THERE TO TAKE PEOPLE AS FAST THEY CAN'T THROUGH HERE. REDUCE GROUP. GOT SOME IS. LEFT IN OUR VALLEY THANK YOU SIR. HI I'M MY NAME IS BRANDON I'M A PART OF I WILL WRITE I HAVE STUDENTS FOR A GREAT PRICE PETER ALLEN HAVE BEEN. SINCE TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN. I'VE BEEN COMING TO THESE HEARINGS FOR PROBABLY FOR. I THINK THREE OR FOUR YEARS NOW SO I HAVE. WELL AWARE OF THAT PROGRESS AND STATE OF THE PROJECT. I WANT TO KIND OF APPROACH THIS FROM A MORE COMMUNITY BASED ANGLE LIKE THE GENTLEMAN THAT CAME BEFORE TALKING ABOUT WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT. WHEN YOU REMOVE THIS FUNDS FROM THE VALLEY YOU'RE NOT JUST AFFECTING THE TRAIN PROJECT YOUR AFFECTING. THE PROGRESS THAT THE MOST IMPOVERISHED STATE PART OF CALIFORNIA IS MAKING. I WORK FOR A SCHOOL BOARD- I WORK IN PRESENT A UNIFIED WE HAVE 85% WE KNOW THAT KIDS DON'T LEARN WHEN THEY'RE LIVING IN POVERTY SO YOU'RE REMOVING SOME OF THE RESOURCES. FROM THESE PARENTS THAT ARE HOPING THIS NEXT GENERATION MOVED FORWARD. THE OTHER THING I WANT TO SAY AND THIS IS REALLY IMPORTANT. I AM SHAKING AND SO YOUR TD WITH OUR LEADERSHIP IN IN OUR- POLITICAL ROMS. AND ALSO IN THIS NATION BECAUSE I FEEL LIKE MOST PEOPLE ACT LIKE CHILDREN. RENTS ARE ONLY INTERESTED IN THEIR NEEDS CHILDREN ARE ONLY INTERESTED IN THEIR AREA CHILDREN ARE ONLY INTERESTED IN WHAT THEY CAN GET AND WHAT IS APPLICABLE TO THEM. ADULTS ACTUALLY HAVE TO WORK THROUGH THINGS ACTUALLY HAVE TO COMPROMISE THEY ACTUALLY HAVE TO SAY HEY THERE'S LOTS OF DIFFERENT OPTIONS BUT WHERE'S THE EQUITY IN THESE OPTIONS. HOW DO THEY IMPACT- THANK YOU SO MUCH THANK YOU. HELLO MY NAME IS SPENT AROUND. AND I'M A RESIDENT SAID COUNTY. I'VE BEEN NAPA HEAD OF THE EFFORTS OF A FOURTH HIGHEST RAIL SINCE THE ELECTION IN TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHT. AND CULTURE TO MERCED COUNTY HIGH SPEED RAIL COMMITTEE WHEN THE EFFORTS BEGAN. CURRENTLY I SERVE AS THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE CENTRAL VALLEY HIGHER EDUCATION CONSORTIUM WHICH UP SERVICE TWENTY SEVEN COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES AND THE CENTRAL VALLEY. HIGH SPEED RAIL WOULD BE ESSENTIAL FOR THOSE INSTITUTIONS AND FOR THEIR STUDENTS SO I'D LIKE TO SHARE THESE THOUGHTS WITH YOU. I STRONGLY SUPPORT THE GOVERNOR'S PLAN. AND THE HIGH SPEED RAILS POLICY OUR RECOMMENDATION OUGHT TO PURSUE A MERCED FRESNO BAKERSFIELD AND FROM OPERATING SEGMENT WITH STOPS AT. KING'S AND TULARE IN MADERA TO PROVIDE HIGH SPEED. PLEASE NOTE THE DIRECT CONNECTIONS AND WE'RE SET TO ACE AND THE SAN JOAQUIN ARE CRITICAL FOR CONNECTING. OF FOR THE NORTHERN. SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY SACRAMENTO AND BABY.

FIRST AND FOREMOST AMONG THESE SO HOW DO SUPPORT OF THE CALIFORNIA HIGH SPEED RAIL. AND LIKE MERRY LICCARDO OF SAN JOSE AND FOLKS IN THIS ROOM. I AM- I SHARE THE SENTIMENT OF MAINTAINING THE VALITY VALLEY INITIAL OPERATION SEGMENT. AS THE ONLY VIABLE SOLUTION FOR THE AGES ARE THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY. WHY BECAUSE IT GETS RIDERSHIP THAT MAKES IT PROFITABLE AND THEREFORE TRACKS PRIVATE INVESTMENT. AS WE MENTIONED EARLIER. IT'S NOT A PUBLIC IT'S ABOUT PRIVATE PUBLIC. AND WE ALL KNOW THAT FOR A PROJECT OF THIS MAGNITUDE REQUIRES- THE PRIVATE SECTOR MARIN HALL. WELL I DON'T- NEED TO PREACH TO THE CHOIR BUT I'M SURE THAT HOUSING SHORTAGE IS AT THE CENTER OF CONVERSATION- THE COST OF LIVING DRIES FLOCKS OF PEOPLE OUT OF SAN JOSE BAY AREA. AND THE CENTRAL VALLEY BECOMES A VERY ATTRACTIVE PLACE. THEREFORE CREATING A MARKET FOR RIDERSHIP- SAM JOINT POWERS AUTHORITY HAS ADDED A BUS ROUTE MADERA SAN JOSE. HERE'S A PERFECT EXAMPLE OF THE DEMAND STEERING. BUT STILL WHICH- LED TO A MAKES MOST SENSE FOR STATE IN OUR TAXPAYERS MEMORIES OF HIM THAT WE ALLOCATE. FUNDS FOR THE MARKET ATTRACTS BIBLE RIDERSHIP THANK YOU FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION THANK YOU SIR. WELL BOUNCE SAVING AND I WANT TO HEAR AT SOME A SHORTNESS AB FAB MY NAME'S JOE WELL AND I AM THREE COMPANIES FROM THE LA AND I AM HERE TODAY TO ASK A BUNCH OF QUESTIONS BUT I DON'T TO DO THAT SO. I WOULD JUST SAY THAT. IT'S NO SECRET THAT THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY FACES ECONOMIC CHALLENGES. MORE SO THAN ANY OTHER PART OF CALIFORNIA. YEAH WITHOUT THIS WHAT OFF OUR BACKS AND THE GOODS PRODUCED YEAR THE ENTIRE STATE. ITS ECONOMY WOULD SUFFER.

AND WE HAVE BEEN MEETING WITH THE JPA LOOKING AT WAYS TO IMPROVE SERVICE IN THIS ALLOCATE. I WANT THINGS WERE SPECIFICALLY INTERESTED IN AND MY MAIN REASON FOR MAKING COMMENTS.

I THINK THAT'S VERY IMPORTANT. I THINK WE SHOULD ALSO ASSUME THAT THEY'RE GONNA BE A LOT OF OTHER BLUNDERS ALONG THE WAY. I WAS A FRESNO CITY COUNCILMAN NOW OR FRESNO COUNTY SUPERVISOR I'M GONNA GIVE ONE EXAMPLE THERE'S A STREET ABOUT A MILE AWAY CALL TO LARRY- OR EXCUSE ME VENTURE A THAT HAS BEEN SHUT DOWN BEING OFFICE SEGMENT OF BUSINESSES IN DOWNTOWN FRESNO. IT'S REALLY PUT THE HURT TO THEM WAIT TILL THAT HAPPENS AND SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA NORTHERN CALIFORNIA YOU'LL FIND OUT THE KIND OF PAIN. THERE ARE COMMUNITIES BEEN LIVING WITH I WOULD LIKE TO- ADD ABOUT THE PROPOSITION ONE A THAT PROPOSITIONS. BEEN BLOWN APART SO MANY WAYS IT'S NOT EVEN FUNNY SO IT'S KIND OF HARD TO HOLD ONE LITTLE ASPECT OF THAT PROPOSITION OVER THE HEADS OF THIS PROJECT FOR INSTANCE- IT WAS TO BE DONE PER AT NINE POINT EIGHT FIVE BILLION DOLLARS. EIGHT HUNDRED MILES OF TRACTOR SO MANY WAYS THE PROP ONE BEEN BLOWN APART. IT'S HARD REST ALL GO BACK TODAY. THE HOLD UP TO THIS ONE ASPECT. AS A CASUAL OBSERVER AND I HAD NO INTENTION OF SPEAKING TODAY. BUT AS A CASUAL OBSERVER YOUR PARTNERS OR WHAT OR MENTALLY WALKING AWAY FROM THE PROJECT OKAY AND BRIAN KELLY I APPRECIATE HIM VERY SHARP I'M GLAD HE WAS INSERTED IN THERE. BUT HE'S HOLDING THE HIGH SPEED RAIL LINE THAT I HEARD SIX EIGHT YEARS AGO AND IT SOUNDS THE EXACT SAME BUT YOU HAVE A LOT OF PEOPLE ASKING WITH OPEN MINDS THEY'RE ASKING HONEST QUESTIONS ARE BEING SHUT DOWN. I DO APPRECIATE THE CONVERSATION TODAY MY QUESTION FOR YOU AND THE PARTNERS IS WHEN DO WE GET TO THAT POINT WHERE WE HAVE TO CHOOSE ONE OR THE OTHER. AND IF THERE'S A POINT WHERE WE IT HAS TO BE HIGH SPEED RAIL. YEAH THANK YOU. CHEN ARAMBULA FOR MEMBERS MISSION. SO I'M SPEAKING ON JOURNALISM GOVERNMENT FOR MANY OF THE CITY FRESNO SPEAK ON BEHALF OF MAYOR BRAND TO CAMP HERE TODAY COLLEGE EYES IS SOMEWHERE BROWN'S A STRONG SUPPORTER OF GOVERNOR SINCE PLAN AND THE HELP I SPEAKER AUTHORITIES MAY TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN POLICY RECOMMENDATIONS TO PURSUE THE MERCED FRESNO BIXEL INTERIM HIGH SPEED RAIL OPERATING SEGMENT- THIS WILL PROVIDE HIGH SCHOOL SERVICE AT THE EARLIEST POSSIBLE TIME WHILE AT THE SAME TIME LEVERAGING THE MAXIMUM AMOUNT. OF CONNECTIVITY TO OTHER KEY REAL SERVICES. THIS ALSO CREATE SIGNIFICANT BENEFITS INCLUDING FASTER MORE FREQUENT AND RELIABLE PASSENGER SERVICE. THAT IS CURRENTLY AVAILABLE IMPROVING AIR QUALITY HERE IN THE VALLEY. AND AS WELL AS EARLY TESTING OF HIGH SPEED RAIL OPERATIONS AND PASSENGER USE AS WELL AS REDUCING RAMP UP TIME FOR FUTURE EXTENSIONS. THE SUCCESS OF THIS EARLY IN TERM SERVICES A CENTRAL TOWARDS IMPLEMENTING THE ULTIMATE HIGH SPEED RAIL SERVICE BETWEEN THE BAY AREA. LOS ANGELES SACRAMENTO SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY AND THE BAY AREA. SO FRESNO IS A IS A CITY THAT IS WAS WORKING TO CATCH UP WITH COASTAL AREAS WITH THE STANDARD OF LIVING AND QUALITY OF LIFE. BY ALMOST EVERY MEASURE HIGHER THAN HERE. THIS PROJECT IS CRITICAL TO FRESNO FUTURE SUCCESS IT WILL INCH THE SHORT TERM MAKE TRAVEL FASTER TO NORTHERN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. AND IN THE LONG TERM HOPEFULLY A HIGH SPEED RAIL LINE. FROM LOS ANGELES TO SAN FRANCISCO WHICH WOULD PUT FRESNO AMONG OTHER THINGS LESS THAN AN HOUR AWAY BY TRAIN FROM SILICON VALLEY. THIS IS THE REAL CHANGE THE PRESIDENT NEEDS. THANK YOU SIR. HELLO GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME AS WELL ALL OVER I AM THE DIRECTOR BUSINESS SERVICES FOR THE FRESNO COUNTY ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION. AND FORMER CITY COUNCIL MEMBER AND MADERA. OF EARLY ON THE HIGH SPEED RAIL PROJECT WAS CHARACTERIZED AS A BULLET TRAIN FOR JOB CREATION WHICH TODAY RINGS TRUE- ESPECIALLY FOR AREAS SUCH AS A CENTRAL VALLEY THAT HAS BEEN UNDER BETA BY POVERTY UNEMPLOYMENT. AND POOR AIR QUALITY. AND WHILE FOR MANY GOOD REASONS- PREVIOUS SPEAKERS HAVE TALKED ABOUT WHY WE SHOULD CONTINUE OUR COMMITMENT HERE- IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY I THINK IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT TO REITERATE THE GROUNDWORK. AS OCCURRED HERE LOCALLY TO PREPARE FOR HIGH SPEED RAIL. OF FIRST AND FOREMOST THERE ARE HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS FOR THE PUBLIC AND PRIVATE INVESTMENT. LAND HERE WITHIN A STONE'S THROW AWAY OF THIS BUILDING. ON THAT IS REALLY HINGES UPON A FULLY FUNCTIONAL SYSTEM AND STATION UNDER OPERATION. FRESNO STATE LAUNCHED THEIR FIRST CURRICULUM- TO PREPARE HIGH SPEED RAIL ENGINEERS TO WORK ON THE PROJECT. AND WE'VE HAD- HUNDREDS OF MILES WORTH ACQUISITION OF RIGHT OF WAY. ON THE WAY- SINCE THAT TIME WE'VE HAD HUNDREDS OF BUSINESSES AND PRIVATE PROPERTY OWNERS IMPACTED TO ACCOMMODATE HIGH SPEED RAIL. WE HAVE SUCCESSFULLY WORKED WITH THE HIGH SPEED RAIL AUTHORITY AND LOCAL JURISDICTIONS TO RETAIN THOSE OPERATIONS. BUT I THINK THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT. IF LEADERS WOULD EVER IT'S FUNNY COMMITMENTS ELSEWHERE WE WILL LEAVE BEHIND THE SENSE OF I COMMUNITIES AND THOSE WHO HAVE BRACED FOR THE POTENTIAL HOUSE ON OUR FUTURE THOSE BUSINESSES THOSE PROPERTY OWNERS. SO ANYTHING LESS THE ANTENNA VISION WILL MEAN THESE EFFORTS WILL BE OFFER NOT THE SACRIFICES AND DOESN'T MEAN MUCH IN AGES ARE WILL BE A BANNER FOR NOTHING MORE THAN ELEVATED REYES SEPARATED. BY PASS RATHER THAN A MEANS TO CONNECT THE STATE ARE. TEACHER THANK YOU THANK YOU. HELLO MY NAME IS DYLAN STONE ON THE REGIONAL PLANNING SUPERVISOR FOR THE MADERA COUNTY TRANSPORTATION COMMISSION THAT IS MADERA COUNTIES IN PO- MUCH LIKE THE OTHER IMPURE NEIGHBORS IN THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY WERE TASKED WITH DOING LONG RANGE PLANNING IN RTP IN SCS I THINK THIS PROJECT- SEEN MERCED TO BAKERSFIELD SEGMENT COMPLETED. IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THAT PROCESS. LIKE THE OTHER REGIONS IN THE STATE WE HAVE TO SHOW IMPROVEMENTS TO GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS AND CONGESTION RELIEF. ON LIKE OTHER REGIONS IN THE STATE WE DON'T HAVE THE SAME OPPORTUNITIES TO THAT WE DON'T HAVE MULTI BILLION DOLLAR METROPOLITAN AREAS BUT WE STILL HAVE TO. PROGRESS TOWARDS THESE GOALS- THIS PROJECT AN ARRAY OF DIFFERENT LEVELS SEEN IT FOR PHIL TO ITS FULLEST EXTENT IS IMPORTANT TO THOSE ACTS. HE MORE PEOPLE ON THIS TRAIN MAKING AT THIS AS EFFICIENT AS IT CAN BE AS ATTRACTIVE AS IT CAN BE TO A SERVICE TO TAKE PEOPLE FROM THE VALLEY. TO ALL THE OTHER PARTS OF THE STATE'S REALLY IMPORTANT GETS PEOPLE OFFER STATE SYSTEMS WHICH ARE ALSO NEEDED PREVENT- IMPROVES OUR HEALTH OUR SAFETY- WE ARE FULLY IN SUPPORT OF SEEING THE MERCED.

THE TEAM MY NAME IS RON TO BROWN. I LIKE TO START WITH A COUPLE OF OBSERVATIONS OBSERVATIONS ABOUT HIGH SPEED LINE ALIGNMENTS AND CLOSE OFFER SPECIFIC RECOMMENDATIONS FOR CALIFORNIA. HIGH SPEED LINES ARE DESIGNED TO TRAVEL UP HIGH SPEEDS BETWEEN DESTINATIONS. THEY'RE DESIGNED LIKE FREEWAYS AND USE CONNECTORS TO EXISTING RAIL INFRASTRUCTURE TO CITY CITIES ALONG THE ROUTE. HIGH SPEED LINES DELIBERATELY. BYPASS CITY COAL FOR RESTRICT. IN DENSELY POPULATED AREAS AND COSTLY IMPACTS ON EXISTING INFRASTRUCTURE. HIGH SPEED LINES AND HAVE A FULL FREE CORRIDORS FOR EXTENSIVE DISTANCES. AND RICK RARELY FIVE AT SPEEDS IN EXCESS OF A HOME TWENTY FIVE MILES AN HOUR. RECENT TEXTBOOK EXAMPLES HIS VIRGIN TRAINS HAVE BEEN OPERATING PROFITABLE REAL CONCESSIONS YOU CASE LAST TWENTY YEARS. THEY'RE BOOKED INVEST HIM HOW BILLION DOLLARS IN THE TO AROUND MILE HIGH SPEED LINE IN THE I FIFTEEN MEDIAN. BETWEEN PLACE OF IN AND LAST WEEK US BUT THEY WILL NOT BILL TIMELY HIGH SPEED TRACKS. ANYWHERE NEAR THE VICINITY OF DOWNTOWN. LAS VEGAS CAN I FINISH YOU CAN SUMMARIZE ROLAND. RIGHT SO WHAT ABOUT CALIFORNIA. SAN FRANCISCO TO GILROY AND BURBANK TO ON I AM I IN THE CORRECT ALIGNMENT FOR HIGH SPEED TRUNK LINE BETWEEN CENTRIST TRINITY BUT THE CITY'S BETWEEN MISS AT AND BAKERSFIELD ON ON THIS LOWER LINE KNOWN AS A FEEDER. AND THE CHALLENGES HOW TO CONNECT THE CITIES AND CITIES ON THE WEST COAST TO THE HIGH SPEED LINE. AND I GO ONE LAST PARAGRAPH YOU MY MATE. STARTING WITH FRESNO FRESNO NEED TO BE CONNECTED TO THE BAY AREA FIVE DAYS AND VALUE. BUT THE ULTIMATE FRESNO CONNECTION TO THE BAY AREA HE'S HIGHWAY ONE EIGHTY ON THE WE NEED TO GILROY BY HOLLISTER. AND THIS ALIGNMENT CAN NO LONGER BE NORMAL BECAUSE I'M NOT TO PASS. IS THE ULTIMATE ALIGNMENT BETWEEN SAN FRANCISCO IN THE LATE. LAST SENTENCE. MOVIE ON SOUTH KING SOLARI NEEDS TO BE CONNECTED TO THE BACK BLOOM VIED ACROSS IT COMIC TO. BAKE THIS FIELD IS NOT AN ISSUE AND THE TIME HAS COME TO RECOGNIZE A PALM DALE IS ON THE LAS VEGAS BRANCH NO DAILY. THANK YOU WROTE. GOOD AFTERNOON THAT MCINTYRE MADERA CALIFORNIA WE HAVE THREE NO. WE NEED TO HAVE A SAFE SYSTEM WE NEED. WE NEED TO HAVE RIDERSHIP. AND WE HAVE TO HAVE THE DESIRE FROM THE PUBLIC TO WRITE IT WE STILL WANT TO WRITE ON IT ALL THE POLLS ARE SHOWING THAT WE HIGH SPEED RAIL STILL FAVORABLE IN CALIFORNIA. BUT THE INITIAL OPERATING SEGMENT THE ORIGINAL ONE WAS NOT VIABLE THAT'S MADERA POPULAR. THE NEW MADERA MERCED TO A BAKERSFIELD IS THE INITIAL REGIONAL INITIAL OPERATING SEGMENT PLUS FOUR POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS. NOT LIKELY THAT IT'S GONNA BE FINANCIALLY FEASIBLE I APPRECIATE THE CONCERN ABOUT RIDERSHIP FROM ASSEMBLY MEMBER AND BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT THE PRIVATE SECTOR IS GOING TO BE CONCERNED WITH. WE HAVE THE FIFTH LARGEST CITY IN FRESNO. AND THE THIRD LARGEST CITY IN SAN JOSE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THAT THOSE GROSS NUMBERS WILL ATTRACT PRIVATE INVESTMENT. THE PEOPLE COMING FROM SAN JOSE WE NEED IN THE BALLET. WE HAVE THEIR HOUSES THEY HAVE OUR JOBS THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU SIR. A GOOD AFTERNOON ASSEMBLYMEMBERS MY NAME IS BRAIN DRAINING I AM A PLANNER FRESNO COUNCIL GOVERNMENTS FROM JUST. DOWN THE STREET- I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO COME HERE FOR BY PUBLIC COMMENT DURING THIS HEARING. I JUST WANT TO EXPRESS STRONG SUPPORT FOR GOVERNOR NUISANCE PLAN AND ALSO THE AUTHORITIES A POLICY RECOMMENDATION TO MOVE FORWARD WITH THE FRIES NUMBERS THAT BAKERSFIELD. IN TERM OPERATING SEGMENTS OF WE THINK THAT THIS WILL PROVIDE HIGH SPEED RAIL SERVICE TO CALIFORNIANS AT THE EARLIEST POSSIBLE TIME WINDOW WHICH IS A HUGE PLUS- IN THIS CENTRAL VALLEY SEGMENT WILL ALSO PROVIDE PRESIDENTS AND OTHER SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY RESIDENTS. WITH CONNECTIONS BOTH NORTHERN AND SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA I ALSO JUST ALSO WANT TO QUICKLY THIS EXPRESSED SUPPORT FOR THE PROPOSED TO PLACE THE MAINTENANCE FACILITY. I JUST SOUTH DOWN THE NINETY NINE A FEW MILES AWAY FROM HERE- IN THIS WILL TAKE ADVANTAGE OF FOR NEWSPAPERS IN EXPANDING ECONOMIC- WORKFORCE AND WILL SUPPORT HIGH SPEED RAIL FOR YOUR. THANK YOU THANK YOU SIR. THANK YOU DAN LEVITT REPRESENT THIS TEAM JOINT POWERS AUTHORITY TO MANAGE AGENCIES FOR THE AMTRAK SO KEANE'S AND ALSO THE CENTRAL VALLEY REAL WORKING GROUP PROCESS TWENTY AGENCY WORKING GROUP BETWEEN SACRAMENTO NUMBER SAID WE STRONGLY SUPPORT THE GOVERNOR'S PLAN IN HIGH SCHOOL FORTIES POLICY RECOMMENDATION FOR THE MERCED TO BAKERSFIELD INTRAOPERATIVE SEGMENT. WE BELIEVE THAT HI FI REAL FUNDS SHOULD BE USED FOR IMPLEMENTING HIGH SPEED RAIL AS PROMISED TO THE VOTERS AND THAT THE EXTENSION NUMBER SAID AND THE BAKERSFIELD ARE NEEDED TO JUSTIFY HIGH SPEED ELECTRIFIED OPERATIONS. AND SILICON VALLEY. THANK YOU THANK YOU SIR. THANK YOU MY NAME IS ROB WAITRESS SOME OF MADERA COUNTY SUPERVISOR AND UP I ALSO SUPPORT THAT FUNDS REMAIN HERE IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY TO COMPLETE THE CENTRAL VALLEY SECTION. AS HAS BEEN IS A REQUIREMENT STRICT REQUIREMENT OF FEDERAL FUNDING- ONE OF THE THINGS THAT- I'VE NOT HEARD TODAY IS. ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT THINGS THAT'S PUBLIC SENTIMENT- WE HAVE TO GET A VICTORY WITH HIGH SPEED RAIL WE CAN'T JUST. GO THROUGH AND HAVE- AS REFERRED TO IN THE FRESNO BEE THESE MONOLITHS HERE AND THERE IT JUST CREATES FODDER CREATES VISUALS FOR THOSE WHO WANT TO SEE HIGH SPEED RAIL. FAIL WE'LL SEE PICTURES OF IN THE WALL STREET JOURNAL LA TIMES. CHRONICLE OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN SO WE NEED TO GET A VICTORY WE NEED TO GET THAT UNDER OUR BELTS AND WHAT THAT'LL DO IS A HELP BUILD MOMENTUM. TO WANT TO MOVE FORWARD HIGH SPEED RAIL IN THE REST OF THE. OFFER SOME REMEMBER FRIEDMAN ANY CLOSING COMMENTS YOU MAY HAVE. SURE WELL FIRST I WANT TO THANK CHAIR FOR CHAIRING THE MEETING- I WOULD WANT TO THANK EVERYBODY WHO CAME AND SAT THROUGH THIS FELT. RELATIVELY LONG HEARING HAND GAVE TESTIMONY AND STUCK AROUND AND OF COURSE TO THE PANELISTS FOR COMING TO FRESNO AND SPEAKING I ACTUALLY WAS REALLY HAPPY TO BE HERE- THE VAST MAJORITY OF THE COMMENTS BECAUSE I THINK THERE'S A LOT OF AGREEMENT IN THIS ROOM. YOU KNOW I THINK WHEN IT COMES TO THIS PROJECT ACROSS THE STATE WHAT YOU TEND TO HAVE IS TWO SCHOOLS OF THOUGHT YOU HAVE THE LET'S BILL HIGH SPEED RAIL PEOPLE AND THEN YOU HAVE THE LET'S NOT BUILD HIGH SPEED WHERE PEOPLE AND WE DIDN'T HAVE A LOT OF LET'S NOT BUILD. HIGH SPEED RAIL OR IT'S NOT BILL GREAT TRAINS IN CALIFORNIA IN THIS ROOM AND I ALSO AGREE WITH THE FOLKS WHO ARE WORRIED ABOUT FINDING LEAVING CENTRAL VALLEY AND THE CENTRAL VALLEY BEING ABANDONED CENTRAL VALLEY NOT GETTING THE ECONOMIC BENEFITS OF HAVING SUPPORTED. A CONTROVERSIAL PRODUCT AND A PROJECT THAT HASN'T ALWAYS BEEN EASY. BECAUSE THIS ROB JEFF IN A LOT OF COMMUNITY IN FRESNO OTHER PLACES WITH BUSINESSES HAVING TO BE MOVED IN. PEOPLE GOING OUT IN A LINE AND SAYING I SUPPORT THIS AND THIS IS WHAT PUBLIC MONEY SHOULD BE USED FOR. AND NOW SEEING THE BENEFITS WITH JOBS IN. AND BUSINESS AND DEVELOPMENT BEING ATTRACTED INTO AN AREA THAT'S STRUGGLED FOR THOSE THINGS. SO I- ABSOLUTELY AGREE THAT WHATEVER WE DO WE CAN'T ABANDON THAT PROMISE. AND WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE'S A WIN FOR THE CENTRAL VALLEY IN THIS PROJECT. SO I'M NOT ONE OF THOSE LET'S BUILDER YOU KNOW WHAT'S NOT BUILD IT. MY ISSUE IS HOW DO WE BUILD IT TO MAKE SURE WE HAVE A SUCCESSFUL PROJECT. AND I WANT TO BE CLEAR ABOUT THAT BECAUSE I THINK THERE'S A REALLY BIG DIFFERENCE. NOW IT IS SOME PEOPLE MAY THINK THAT BUILDING A TRAIN THAT GOES FROM BAKERSFIELD. TO MODESTO THAT EVEN IF THAT'S THE ONLY THING WE BUILD THAT SUCCESSFUL. THAT MAY BE TRUE I MEAN IT MAY VERY WELL BE THAT BAKERSFIELD IS GROWING AND FRESNO IS GROWING. AND MODESTO IS GROWING IN THAT MAYBE A VERY EXPENSIVE TWO HUNDRED MILE AN HOUR TRAIN THAT IS ONLY. BOOK BY THOSE CITY IS IT. IS IMPORTANT IS GOOD ENOUGH. AND THAT MAYBE I JUST DON'T KNOW BUT THAT'S NOT ALWAYS PROMISED TO CALIFORNIA BUT WE FROM. THEM IS LINKED. WITH THE CENTRAL VALLEY BUT ALL LOOKING THE CENTRAL VALLEY. TO THE BAY AREA AND- CENTRAL VALLEY TO LOS ANGELES AND MAYBE TO SAN DIEGO. TO ME THE SUCCESSFUL PROJECT WOULD BE ONE THAT ULTIMATELY. GET BACK. CAN LIVE IN CENTRAL. A FACT TRAIN. THE BAY YEAH AND TO TRACTIVE THAT YOU DON'T WANT TO DRIVE OR THAT YOU CAN TAKE A TRAIN. FROM RIGHT HERE IN FRESNO HOPEFULLY ONE DAY ALL THE WAY TO LOS ANGELES TO THE HAVING TO TAKE A BUS FROM BAKERS. DOWN BUT TO ME THAT'S WHAT SUCCESS REALLY LOOKS LIKE. SO I'M NOT SAYING LET'S PULL MONEY OUT OF THE CENTRAL VALLEY IN ABANDONED YOU. I SAY WHAT WE HAVE TO FIGURE OUT IS LEGISLATORS IT'S OUR RESPONSIBILITY TO MAKE SURE THAT WHATEVER MONEY WE USE. GETS US TO THAT SCHOOL SYSTEM EVENTUALLY. AND AS FAST AS WE CAN IT WAS THE WORK. WERE FRESNO AND BAKERSFIELD MODESTO. HAVE THAT CONNECTIVE ITTY TO THE REST OF THE STATE. THAT'S WHAT I THINK SUCCESS LOOKS LIKE. SO THE QUESTION. IS HOW. TAKE THE MONEY THAT WE HAVE AND BRING THAT VISION TO FOR RUSSIAN AS- AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE. I KNOW. WHAT WORD WE'RE DISCUSSING HERE IS NOT. IS NOT. LET'S NOT BUILD IT LET'S TO PULL MONEY OUT OF THE CENTRAL VALLEY. AND LEAVE THEM ALONE IT'S HOW DO WE GET TO WHERE THE CENTRAL VALLEY. CONNECT TO THAT EXTENT. ALL THE WAY TO THE BAY AREA AND ALL THE WAY TO LOS ANGELES. SO JUST TO BE CLEAR I THOUGHT I HEARD FROM PEOPLE THAT THEY WANT TO SEE AND I'M WITH YOU ON THAT AND IT'S KIND OF HOW DO WE MAKE SURE THAT THAT WHAT AN- EVER INVEST WE DO. GUESS AS TO THAT THE FASTEST. THANK YOU ASSEMBLYMEMBER FRIEDMAN FOR- STICKING OUT THROUGH THE HEARING- I WOULD. PROBABLY COMMENT THERE'S A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE- MERCED BUT- IT COULD HAVE. BEEN A SLIP OF THE TONGUE IN THE LAST STATEMENT- I DO WANT. TO COME BACK TO- GOVERNOR SOME STATE OF THE STATE IF I COULD. WHERE HE SAID THAT HIGH SPEED RAIL IS MORE THAN A TRAIN PROJECT. IT'S ABOUT ECONOMIC TRANSFORMATION AND UNLOCKING THE ENORMOUS POTENTIAL OF THE- IN TERMS OF THE DISCUSSION TODAY I'D LIKE TO FOCUS ON PAGE FIVE OF THE HANDOUT FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO READ IT. WHERE THEY LOOKED AT THE EARLY TRAIN OPERATOR REPORT WHICH CONCLUDED THAT AN INVESTMENTS TO EXTEND THE CENTRAL VALLEY SEGMENTS TUMORS THAT IN BAKERSFIELD. WOULD OFFER A SIGNIFICANT IMPROVED SERVICE AN INCREASE BENEFIT TO CENTRAL VALLEY PASSENGERS. WHILE INVESTMENTS IN EITHER THE BAY AREA OR SOMETHING CALIFORNIA. WOULD YOU BUILD LIMITED RIDERSHIP GROWTH AND MINIMAL IMPROVEMENT IN TRAVEL TIMES. I LOOK FORWARD TO THE QUANTITATIVE ANALYSIS THAT WILL COME FROM THE EARLY TRAIN OPERATOR AT IT WILL HELP US TO FORM THE TWENTY TWENTY BUSINESS PLAN. BUT I'D LIKE TO AND IF I CAN WITH GOVERNOR NEW SOME WORDS FROM JUST LAST WEEK. LET US DO SOMETHING DEMONSTRATE OF ALL. REAL TRANSFORMATIVE TO THIS PART OF THE STATE AND DO JUST THE PROMISE TO TAXPAYERS WITH THAT WE WILL CONCLUDE TODAY'S HEARING THANK YOU ALL FOR ATTENDING
