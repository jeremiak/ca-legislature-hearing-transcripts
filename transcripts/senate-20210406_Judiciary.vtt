THANK YOU- SENATE ALAN. PLEASE

PROCEED. THANK YOU SO MUCH- AND

00:07:30.149 --> 00:07:32.051
I WAS JUST THE NEW TELLING MY

00:07:32.118 --> 00:07:32.952
COLLEAGUE ABOUT WHAT WHAT YOU

00:07:33.019 --> 00:07:35.054
WHAT WHAT IS A VERY DIFFICULT-

00:07:35.121 --> 00:07:36.789
SERIES OF ISSUESTO THINK ABOUT

00:07:36.856 --> 00:07:38.591
THIS IS OUR WASTE MANAGEMENT

00:07:38.658 --> 00:07:42.295
AND RECYCLING SYSTEM. NOW AND

00:07:42.361 --> 00:07:44.664
THEY'RE A BIG- ISSUES WITH THAT

00:07:44.730 --> 00:07:45.865
WITH THAT SYSTEM AND- CERTAINLY

00:07:45.932 --> 00:07:47.233
WE'VE GOT LEGISLATION TO TRY TO

00:07:47.300 --> 00:07:49.502
FIX. THE SYSTEM WRIT LARGE BUT

00:07:49.569 --> 00:07:51.304
THIS IS ACTUALLY A RELATIVELY

00:07:51.370 --> 00:07:53.039
IS A PRETTY SIMPLE MEASURE. I

00:07:53.105 --> 00:07:54.240
DEALING WITH A COMPLICATED

00:07:54.307 --> 00:07:56.242
ISSUE SO CURRENT LAW. PREVENTS

00:07:56.309 --> 00:07:58.344
THE MANUFACTURE FOR MAKING AN

00:07:58.411 --> 00:08:00.112
UNTRUTHFUL ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIM.

00:08:00.179 --> 00:08:02.448
SUCH AS EARTH FRIENDLY OR

00:08:02.515 --> 00:08:06.185
RECYCLABLE. IF IT IF IT IS NOT

00:08:06.252 --> 00:08:08.688
RECYCLABLE- AND SO NOW HERE'S

00:08:08.754 --> 00:08:09.722
THE PROBLEM A LOT OF

00:08:09.789 --> 00:08:11.591
MANUFACTURERS WHO ARE NOT

00:08:11.657 --> 00:08:14.093
ALLOWED TO SAY THAT THEIR ITEM

00:08:14.160 --> 00:08:15.995
IS RECYCLABLE. ARE ALLOWED

00:08:16.062 --> 00:08:17.864
UNDER CURRENT LAW TO STAMP THE

00:08:17.930 --> 00:08:20.333
RECYCLING SYMBOL. ON THEIR

00:08:20.399 --> 00:08:23.169
PRODUCT. SO AND THEY'RE SENDING

00:08:23.236 --> 00:08:24.637
A SIGNAL TO A CONSUMER THAT AN

00:08:24.704 --> 00:08:26.939
ITEM IS RECYCLABLE EVEN IF IT

00:08:27.006 --> 00:08:29.308
REALLY ISN'T. SO HERE'S THE

00:08:29.375 --> 00:08:31.043
HERE'S THE SAD TRUTH IN

00:08:31.110 --> 00:08:33.479
CALIFORNIA LESS THAN 15% OF

00:08:33.546 --> 00:08:35.281
SINGLE USE PLASTIC IS RECYCLED.

00:08:35.348 --> 00:08:36.482
RECYCLING COSTS EXCEED THE

00:08:36.549 --> 00:08:38.751
SCRAP VALUE OF THE PLASTIC

00:08:38.818 --> 00:08:40.353
MATERIAL ITSELF THAT'S PART OF

00:08:40.419 --> 00:08:41.354
THAT'S WHEN IT WHEN ENORMOUS

00:08:41.420 --> 00:08:42.722
PART OF THE PROBLEM. THE

00:08:42.788 --> 00:08:46.025
RECYCLING PROCESS IS EXPENSIVE-

00:08:46.092 --> 00:08:47.927
AND ACTUALLY ENVIRONMENTALLY

00:08:47.994 --> 00:08:51.397
DAMAGING AS WELL. HI HOWEVER. I

00:08:51.464 --> 00:08:53.699
KNOW ALL OF US DUTIFULLY TRIED

00:08:53.766 --> 00:08:55.501
TO FILL OUR BLUE BINS WITH

00:08:55.568 --> 00:08:56.035
ITEMS THAT WE BELIEVE ARE

00:08:56.102 --> 00:08:57.536
RECYCLABLE. BUT DOES JUST

00:08:57.603 --> 00:08:58.738
TALKING CENTER PORCHES AND WE

00:08:58.804 --> 00:09:00.172
WERE GOING BACK AND FORTH ABOUT

00:09:00.239 --> 00:09:02.275
ITEMS THAT THAT ARE THAT WE

00:09:02.341 --> 00:09:03.609
COMMONLY BELIEVED TO RECYCLE

00:09:03.676 --> 00:09:04.777
BUT THAT BUT THAT IN THE END OF

00:09:04.844 --> 00:09:07.246
THE DAY ARE NOT. ACTUALLY

00:09:07.313 --> 00:09:08.981
RECYCLE. AND IN THIS IS

00:09:09.048 --> 00:09:10.616
ACTUALLY A PROBLEM IT'S WHAT WE

00:09:10.683 --> 00:09:11.651
NOW CALL WISH CYCLING WHERE

00:09:11.717 --> 00:09:14.086
PEOPLE. PUT ITEMS THAT THEY

00:09:14.153 --> 00:09:14.921
BELIEVE TO BE RECYCLABLE INTO

00:09:14.987 --> 00:09:17.089
THE BLUE BAND IN THAT IN DOING

00:09:17.156 --> 00:09:18.591
SO IT ENDS UP WITH A

00:09:18.658 --> 00:09:19.926
CONTAMINATING THE RECYCLING

00:09:19.992 --> 00:09:21.227
STREAM MAKING IT MORE COSTLY TO

00:09:21.294 --> 00:09:21.861
SORT AND CLEAN THE CHILI

00:09:21.928 --> 00:09:23.262
RECYCLE MATERIAL I USED TO DO

00:09:23.329 --> 00:09:24.931
THIS MYSELF AND I'M A REGULAR.

00:09:24.997 --> 00:09:26.365
I'M ONE OF THESE GUYS WHO LIKE

00:09:26.432 --> 00:09:27.833
TO SUBSCRIBE TO THE NEWSPAPER.

00:09:27.900 --> 00:09:30.736
OKAY YOU KNOW- SO HI. MY LILY

00:09:30.803 --> 00:09:32.738
TIME TO COME IN A LITTLE BAG.

00:09:32.805 --> 00:09:35.474
IT WAS A RECYCLING SYMBOL

00:09:35.541 --> 00:09:36.042
STAMPED ON THE BACK. AND I

00:09:36.108 --> 00:09:36.809
WOULD DUTIFULLY I WOULD

00:09:36.876 --> 00:09:38.277
LITERALLY SETTING ASIDE AND PUT

00:09:38.344 --> 00:09:40.046
THE BAG INTO MY BLUE BIN.

00:09:40.112 --> 00:09:41.681
BECAUSE I THOUGHT HAVING SEEN

00:09:41.747 --> 00:09:43.916
THE RECYCLING SYMBOL ON MY BACK

00:09:43.983 --> 00:09:44.550
AND THIS WAS A RECYCLE MATERIAL

00:09:44.617 --> 00:09:47.019
THE- I. NOW THROUGH THIS JOB I

00:09:47.086 --> 00:09:47.920
HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO GO

00:09:47.987 --> 00:09:49.722
VISIT. AMERSON RECYCLING

00:09:49.789 --> 00:09:52.058
CENTERS AND WASTE MANAGEMENT

00:09:52.124 --> 00:09:54.660
FACILITIES AND DUMPS. IN THE IT

00:09:54.727 --> 00:09:55.728
TURNS OUT OF THOSE LITTLE BAGS

00:09:55.795 --> 00:09:57.730
ARE A REAL PROBLEM NOT ONLY DO

00:09:57.797 --> 00:09:58.297
THEY END UP COMING UP THE

00:09:58.364 --> 00:10:00.900
MACHINES. THAT PLASTIC FILM BUT

00:10:00.967 --> 00:10:02.001
THEY ACTUALLY ALSO END UP

00:10:02.068 --> 00:10:03.669
CONTAMINATING THE PAPER STREAM

00:10:03.736 --> 00:10:06.105
THEY GET. THEY GET INTO OUR

00:10:06.172 --> 00:10:07.807
PAPER STREAM. ORDERLY ONE MANY

00:10:07.873 --> 00:10:09.408
REASONS WHY CHINA DOESN'T WANT

00:10:09.475 --> 00:10:10.743
TO RECYCLE MATERIAL ANYMORE

00:10:10.810 --> 00:10:12.211
BECAUSE ALL THIS. OR THE WHY

00:10:12.278 --> 00:10:13.312
THE PAPER MILLS AS WELL I THESE

00:10:13.379 --> 00:10:15.014
PAPER BILLS SHOW UP WITH TONS

00:10:15.081 --> 00:10:17.316
AND TONS. OF PLASTIC FILM STUCK

00:10:17.383 --> 00:10:18.951
IT IN THE PAPER BELLS IN IT IT

00:10:19.018 --> 00:10:21.620
REALLY BECOMES A PROBLEM WHEN

00:10:21.687 --> 00:10:22.221
IT COMES TO TRYING TO RECYCLE

00:10:22.288 --> 00:10:25.324
THAT PAPER. SO THE IDEA IS THAT

00:10:25.391 --> 00:10:25.958
IF THE MATERIAL IS NOT ACTUALLY

00:10:26.025 --> 00:10:27.426
RECYCLABLE. I DON'T REALLY

00:10:27.493 --> 00:10:29.862
BELIEVE THE SYSTEM THE WASTE

00:10:29.929 --> 00:10:30.896
MANAGEMENT SYSTEM HAS TO REMOVE

00:10:30.963 --> 00:10:32.365
THE ITEM FROM THE CONVEYOR BELT

00:10:32.431 --> 00:10:33.666
AFTER CYCLING FACILITY IS THE-

00:10:33.733 --> 00:10:34.867
THING CARTED AWAY TO A

00:10:34.934 --> 00:10:36.435
LANDFILL. IT'S EXTRA WORK

00:10:36.502 --> 00:10:38.371
INCREASE WASTE RATES. AND COST

00:10:38.437 --> 00:10:40.673
OF. A PROCESS TO RECYCLE

00:10:40.740 --> 00:10:43.376
MATERIAL- A SURVEY JUST

00:10:43.442 --> 00:10:44.377
RELEASED THIS YEAR BY THE

00:10:44.443 --> 00:10:45.177
LEAGUE OF CALIFORNIA CITIES

00:10:45.244 --> 00:10:49.048
FOUND THAT MORE THAT. IT'S MORE

00:10:49.115 --> 00:10:49.648
THAN SEVEN OUT OF TEN CITIES.

00:10:49.715 --> 00:10:51.083
SO OVER 70% OF OUR CITY'S

00:10:51.150 --> 00:10:52.418
ANTICIPATE INCREASING WASTE

00:10:52.485 --> 00:10:54.086
COLLECTION READ BY WAS MUCH AS

00:10:54.153 --> 00:10:55.654
TWENTY PERCENT. TO COVER THE

00:10:55.721 --> 00:10:57.123
COST OF MANAGING THE ADDITIONAL

00:10:57.189 --> 00:10:59.291
WICKS. MEMBERS THIS IS NOT JUST

00:10:59.358 --> 00:11:00.259
AN ENVIRONMENTAL PROBLEM IT'S

00:11:00.326 --> 00:11:02.328
BECOMING A PART OF THE PROBLEM.

00:11:02.395 --> 00:11:03.829
FOR OUR CONSTITUENTS IN FACT

00:11:03.896 --> 00:11:05.297
THE FOLKS IN SACRAMENTO KNOW

00:11:05.364 --> 00:11:06.766
THIS ALL TOO WELL. THAT THIS

00:11:06.832 --> 00:11:09.201

MONTH. EVERY SINGLE MONTH HERE

00:11:13.606 --> 00:11:14.173
IN SACRAMENTO COUNTY BECAUSE OF

00:11:14.240 --> 00:11:16.042
THIS PROBLEM. THE STREET A

00:11:16.108 --> 00:11:17.276
LOCAL RECYCLING WE SYSTEMS IS

00:11:17.343 --> 00:11:18.611
COMPOUNDED AS CONSUMERS

00:11:18.677 --> 00:11:20.880
MISTAKENLY BELIEVE. THE CHASING

ARROW SYMBOL THE SPECIAL

00:11:21.447 --> 00:11:23.149
RECYCLING SYMBOL OFTEN IN

CIRCLES THE PLASTIC RESIN

00:11:24.483 --> 00:11:26.786
IDENTIFICATION CODE. I THINK WE

00:11:26.852 --> 00:11:28.187
JUSTIFICATION BELIEVE THAT

00:11:28.254 --> 00:11:30.389
MEANS THE PRODUCT. IS GOING TO

00:11:30.456 --> 00:11:31.924
BE RECYCLED IF THEY THROW IN

00:11:31.991 --> 00:11:33.559
THEIR BLUE BIN. THIS IS A

00:11:33.626 --> 00:11:34.527
SYSTEM AS YOU MAY KNOW THAT

00:11:34.593 --> 00:11:35.961
CLASSIFIES ALL TYPES OF

00:11:36.028 --> 00:11:38.230
PLASTICS FROM NUMBERS ONE THREE

00:11:38.297 --> 00:11:40.332
SEVEN. IT WAS DESIGNED AS A

00:11:40.399 --> 00:11:41.967
METHOD FOR WASTE FACILITIES TO

00:11:42.034 --> 00:11:45.204
PROPERLY SORT PLASTICS NOT. TO

00:11:45.271 --> 00:11:45.704
SUGGEST LIKE ABILITY TO

00:11:45.771 --> 00:11:47.940
CONSUMERS. YET AFTER THIRTY

00:11:48.007 --> 00:11:48.874
YEARS AND USE THE SYMBOL IS

00:11:48.941 --> 00:11:51.010
GOING TO BE STATE AS UNDERSTOOD

00:11:51.077 --> 00:11:52.445
AS THE RECYCLING SYMBOL. LET'S

00:11:52.511 --> 00:11:53.145
BE HONEST WE DON'T KNOW HOW

00:11:53.212 --> 00:11:55.481
CONFUSING. RECYCLING IS IN IN

RECYCLING RANKS AHEAD. OF SO IT

00:12:03.289 --> 00:12:05.424
TURNS OUT THAT KNOWING WHAT HOW

00:12:05.491 --> 00:12:07.626
TO RECYCLE IS MORE CONFUSING.

00:12:07.693 --> 00:12:09.762

BILL HEARING OFFICER WOULD BE

01:11:51.106 --> 01:11:52.307
REQUIRED TO CONSIDER

PERSON'S MEDICAL CONDITION AS

01:11:54.810 --> 01:11:56.311
WELL. AND HOW THAT CONDITION

01:11:56.378 --> 01:11:57.780
BEARS ON THE CERTIFICATION OF

ILL. AND CLEARLY NOT ABLE TO.

01:12:09.024 --> 01:12:11.126
THINK RATIONALLY AT THAT POINT-

01:12:11.193 --> 01:12:12.127
AND WHILE THEY MAY BE ABLE TO

01:12:12.194 --> 01:12:13.929
PROVIDE BASIC NEEDS IF THEY'RE

01:12:30.112 --> 01:12:31.580
WOULD ADD. A SMALLER ADDITIONAL

01:12:31.647 --> 01:12:33.115
CRITERIA NOT EXPANDING THE

THOSE THE PEOPLE ARE THERE

01:12:36.852 --> 01:12:39.488
BEFORE WE SEND THEM RIGHT BACKOUT AGAIN. PERHAPS WE SHOULD

01:12:39.555 --> 01:12:40.622
SEE IF THEY'RE ABLE TO PROVIDE

THESE ARE HARD ISSUES AND I

01:13:27.236 --> 01:13:28.237
KNOW THAT PEOPLE CARE ABOUT

01:13:28.303 --> 01:13:30.005

CHRONIC MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES

01:13:38.547 --> 01:13:40.149
GET HER IN FRONT OF A JUDGE AND

01:13:40.215 --> 01:13:41.483
SHE WOULD BE LET GO AND

01:13:41.550 --> 01:13:43.118

ENOUGH TOKEEP. BUT SHE WAS

01:13:54.797 --> 01:13:55.764
SICK ENOUGH TO GET RATE. I'VE

01:14:01.370 --> 01:14:02.304
TAKEN AMENDMENTS LAID OUT

01:14:02.371 --> 01:14:04.173
ANALYSIS THAT TO CLARIFY WHAT A

01:14:04.239 --> 01:14:05.908
MEDICAL CONDITION IS. NOT AND

01:14:05.974 --> 01:14:07.142
CANNOT BE SOMETHING THAT JUST

01:14:07.209 --> 01:14:09.178
BECAUSE FROM BEING HOMELESS-

01:14:09.244 --> 01:14:10.145
AND IT'S BEEN HAS TO BE

01:14:10.212 --> 01:14:11.446
SOMETHING THAT WITHIN A PERIOD

01:14:11.513 --> 01:14:14.183
OF SIX MONTHS. WOULD LEAD TO

01:14:14.249 --> 01:14:16.251
THAT EVEN EVEN FOR THEIR DEATH.

01:14:16.318 --> 01:14:17.786
THE PSYCHIATRIST MUST CONSULT

01:14:17.853 --> 01:14:18.821
WITH A PHYSICIAN TO CERTIFY

01:14:18.887 --> 01:14:19.855

01:14:21.323 --> 01:14:22.524
AND THAT PAY AND THE PATIENT

01:14:22.591 --> 01:14:23.625

APPROPRIATE TREATMENT. TO BE

01:14:27.963 --> 01:14:29.097
CLEAR NOTHING IN THIS BILL

01:14:29.164 --> 01:14:30.432
ALLOWS FOR MANDATED MEDICAL

01:14:30.499 --> 01:14:31.466

01:23:48.857 --> 01:23:49.424
THAT THE TREATMENT WOULD REDUCE

01:23:49.491 --> 01:23:51.493
THE RISK. OF THE PERSON'S

POINTS BEHIND THIS BILL WE JUST

01:34:21.222 --> 01:34:22.156
WANTED TO EMPHASIZE A FEW QUICK

01:34:22.223 --> 01:34:24.258

BE VERY DANGEROUS AND DIDN'T

01:34:36.170 --> 01:34:37.505
MAKE ANY REASONABLE EFFORTS TO

01:34:45.746 --> 01:34:47.448
BEFORE THERE WERE THREE. AND OR

01:34:47.515 --> 01:34:48.983

BILL THAT ALLOWS COALITION TO

01:48:56.897 --> 01:48:59.199
ONE OF HESITATION THIS THIS-

01:48:59.266 --> 01:49:01.401
COMMITTEE I BELIEVE IT WAS LAST

01:49:01.468 --> 01:49:03.336
YEAR MAYBE THE YEAR BEFORE

01:49:03.403 --> 01:49:04.738
DEALT WITH A SIMILAR SITUATION

01:49:04.804 --> 01:49:07.140
WHERE ATTORNEY CLIENT

01:49:07.207 --> 01:49:09.409
PROTECTIONS WERE SOUGHT FOR

01:49:09.476 --> 01:49:11.945
MEMBERS OF A- COLLECTIVE

01:49:12.012 --> 01:49:14.915
BARGAINING ORGANIZATION- TO

01:49:14.981 --> 01:49:17.918
FACILITATE THE- DISCLOSURE OF

01:49:17.984 --> 01:49:20.654

AND- COLLECTIVE BARGAINING

01:49:22.522 --> 01:49:24.758
LEADERSHIP. AND I UNDERSTAND

01:49:24.824 --> 01:49:27.661
THAT THERE IS A NEED AND IT'S

01:49:27.727 --> 01:49:29.429
AN IMPORTANT NEED THAT

01:49:29.496 --> 01:49:31.031
INDIVIDUALS HAVE THE ABILITY TO

01:49:31.097 --> 01:49:35.535
COMMUNICATE. WITH FOLKS. IN GET

01:49:35.602 --> 01:49:37.804
SOME DEGREE OF INFORMATION.

01:49:37.871 --> 01:49:39.472
WHILE MINIMIZING THE RISK OF

01:49:39.539 --> 01:49:40.840
SUCH DISCLOSURES IN THAT

01:49:40.907 --> 01:49:44.277
PROCESS. MY CONCERN HERE IT

01:49:44.344 --> 01:49:46.112
GOES BACK TO WHAT WE

01:49:46.179 --> 01:49:48.481
EXPERIENCED- WITH OF WITH AN

01:49:48.548 --> 01:49:50.951
EARLIER VERSION OF THIS TYPE OF

BILL IS WHAT ARE THE

01:49:52.585 --> 01:49:54.921
IMPLICATIONS OF EXPANDING

ATTORNEY CLIENT PRIVILEGE. AND

01:49:57.157 --> 01:49:58.925
I THINK THE AUTHOR IN A MINUTE

01:49:58.992 --> 01:50:01.661
IF I IF I MAY POSE A QUESTION

01:50:01.728 --> 01:50:02.262
OR TWO AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME

01:50:02.329 --> 01:50:05.832
TO THE AUTHOR. IS THAT. THE SAN

01:50:05.899 --> 01:50:07.334
DIEGO COURT OF APPEALS

01:50:07.400 --> 01:50:10.236
DECISION. I HAD OCCASION TO

01:50:10.303 --> 01:50:14.074
READ IT LAST NIGHT- I THINK

01:50:14.140 --> 01:50:14.641
IT'S PRETTY IMPORTANT PRETTY

01:50:14.708 --> 01:50:17.777
TELLING. THE COURT OF PPEALS

01:50:17.844 --> 01:50:20.714
IN THIS SUBJECT MATTER.

01:50:20.780 --> 01:50:24.818
IDENTIFIED THAT ATTORNEY CLIENT

01:50:24.884 --> 01:50:27.053
PRIVILEGE IS DESIGNED

01:50:27.120 --> 01:50:29.889
INHERENTLY TO BE BETWEEN ONE AN

01:50:29.956 --> 01:50:32.759
ATTORNEY NUMBER TWO A CLIENT

01:50:32.826 --> 01:50:34.361
WITH THE EXPECTATION OF

01:50:34.427 --> 01:50:37.530
PROVIDING LEGAL SERVICE THROUGH

01:50:37.597 --> 01:50:40.367
THAT RELATIONSHIP. HERE I

01:50:40.433 --> 01:50:42.936
BELIEVE THIS BILL IS ASKING FOR

01:50:43.003 --> 01:50:44.804
US TO DO AWAY WITH THE

01:50:44.871 --> 01:50:46.706
CONDITION PRECEDENT THAT THERE

01:50:46.773 --> 01:50:50.677
BE. ONE AN ATTORNEY AND TO A

01:50:50.744 --> 01:50:53.947
CLIENT. IN THIS SITUATION THE

01:50:54.014 --> 01:50:57.717
DEPARTMENT OF- HOUSING- FOR

01:50:57.784 --> 01:51:01.087
EMPLOYMENT AND HOUSING. SERVES

01:51:01.154 --> 01:51:03.957
THE NEEDS OF THE INDIVIDUALS OF

01:51:04.024 --> 01:51:06.059
THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. IT IS

01:51:06.126 --> 01:51:08.061
NOT SERVE AS AN ATTORNEY OR

01:51:08.128 --> 01:51:11.331
LEGAL ADVISER TO THE INDIVIDUAL

01:51:11.398 --> 01:51:14.501
WHO IS- PRESENTING INFORMATION

01:51:14.567 --> 01:51:15.802
PRESENTING POTENTIALLY

01:51:15.869 --> 01:51:17.871
CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION.

01:51:17.937 --> 01:51:20.874
BECAUSE THERE'S NO FORESEEABLE

01:51:20.940 --> 01:51:23.109
NEXUS BETWEEN THAT CLIENT IN

01:51:23.176 --> 01:51:25.979
THAT DEPARTMENT LEGAL ADVISER

01:51:26.046 --> 01:51:27.080
THAT WOULD ALLOW FOR THEM TO

01:51:27.147 --> 01:51:29.282
PROVIDE LEGAL SERVICE TO THAT

01:51:29.349 --> 01:51:32.485
INDIVIDUAL. SO MY CONCERN IS

01:51:32.552 --> 01:51:34.587
THAT IF WE KNOW BASED ON THE

01:51:34.654 --> 01:51:35.155
SAME DAY OF COURT OF APPEALS

01:51:35.221 --> 01:51:38.091
DECISION. THAT AN INDIVIDUAL

01:51:38.158 --> 01:51:40.326
WHO REACHES OUT TO A DEPARTMENT

01:51:40.393 --> 01:51:42.462
WHERE THERE WILL NEVER EVER BE

01:51:42.529 --> 01:51:45.331
A FIDUCIARY DUTY OR EXPECTATION

01:51:45.398 --> 01:51:48.401
OF. PROVIDING LEGAL SERVICE IF

01:51:48.468 --> 01:51:50.203
WE EXPANDED TOURNEY CLIENT

01:51:50.270 --> 01:51:52.138
PROTECTIONS TO THAT. THEN I

01:51:52.205 --> 01:51:55.075
THINK. THAT WOULD BE A KITTEN

01:51:55.141 --> 01:51:57.877
TO AN INDIVIDUAL REACHING OUT

01:51:57.944 --> 01:51:58.411
TO THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S

01:51:58.478 --> 01:52:00.947
OFFICE. ASKING FOR INTERNET

01:52:01.014 --> 01:52:04.684
CLIENT. COMMUNICATION WHEN THE

01:52:04.751 --> 01:52:06.252
DA'S OFFICE OR THE ATTORNEY

01:52:06.319 --> 01:52:08.421
GENERAL'S OFFICE LOOKS AFTER

01:52:08.488 --> 01:52:10.156
THE INTERESTS OF THE WHOLE OF

01:52:10.223 --> 01:52:12.725
THE STATE NOT THE INDIVIDUAL.

01:52:12.792 --> 01:52:15.328
SO THERE'S A THERE'S A WE USE

01:52:15.395 --> 01:52:17.330
AT ALL FOR A SLIPPERY SLOPE I

01:52:17.397 --> 01:52:20.166
MEAN THIS IS THIS IS VERY

01:52:20.233 --> 01:52:22.302
COMPELLING STATE CONSEQUENCES

01:52:22.368 --> 01:52:24.471
THAT WE COULD FORESEE HERE SO I

01:52:24.537 --> 01:52:26.306
GUESS MY QUESTION TO THE AUTHOR

01:52:26.372 --> 01:52:30.243
IF I MAY THROUGH THE CHAIR. IS

01:52:30.310 --> 01:52:32.178
I'D LIKE TO HEAR AN EXPLANATION

01:52:32.245 --> 01:52:33.980
AS TO HOW THIS WOULD BE

01:52:34.047 --> 01:52:36.416
CONFINED IF THIS BILL WERE TO

01:52:36.483 --> 01:52:38.084
MOVE FORWARD THAT WOULDN'T BE

01:52:38.151 --> 01:52:40.320
EXPANDED UPON IN THE NEXT

01:52:40.386 --> 01:52:42.355
LEGISLATIVE IN SUBSEQUENT

01:52:42.422 --> 01:52:44.424
LEGISLATIVE CYCLES. WE'RE

01:52:44.491 --> 01:52:45.892
INDIVIDUALS WOULD BE SEEKING

01:52:45.959 --> 01:52:48.228
INFORMATION AND THEN WE GIVE

01:52:48.294 --> 01:52:49.996
THEM BEING GIVEN ATTORNEY

01:52:50.063 --> 01:52:52.699
CLIENT PROTECTIONS WHEN THEY

01:52:52.765 --> 01:52:54.767
WILL NEVER EVER BE A CLIENT. IF

01:52:54.834 --> 01:52:56.536
I COULD POSE THAT QUESTION TO

01:52:56.603 --> 01:52:58.037

01:53:06.613 --> 01:53:08.281
THIS MAY BE MY CLOTHES HOPE

01:53:08.348 --> 01:53:13.319
LIVES NO MORE QUESTIONS. WHAT

01:53:13.386 --> 01:53:18.491
IS THE PUBLIC INTEREST. IN

01:53:18.558 --> 01:53:19.325
NINETEEN FIFTY NINE WE DECIDED

01:53:19.392 --> 01:53:21.461
IN THIS STATE THAT WE ARE GOING

01:53:21.528 --> 01:53:23.530
TO PROTECT PEOPLE'S CIVIL

01:53:23.596 --> 01:53:25.832
RIGHTS. THAT WE WERE GOING TO

01:53:25.899 --> 01:53:27.967
CREATE A STATE AGENCY TO

01:53:28.034 --> 01:53:31.404
PROTECT INDIVIDUAL CIVIL RIGHTS

01:53:31.471 --> 01:53:34.474
THAT IS THE PUBLIC INTEREST.

01:53:34.541 --> 01:53:36.876
QUESTION BECOMES JUST LIKE THE

01:53:36.943 --> 01:53:38.478
E. O. C. WHERE I'VE HAD A

01:53:38.545 --> 01:53:39.279
RELATIVE WHO USED TO BE THE

01:53:39.345 --> 01:53:41.047
CHAIRMAN OF THAT. UNDER BOTH

01:53:41.114 --> 01:53:45.785
NIXON AND FORD. THE AMBASSADOR.

01:53:45.852 --> 01:53:49.122
THIS SAME MODEL APPLIANCE SO

01:53:49.189 --> 01:53:51.758
WHAT WE HAVE IS A PERSON WHO

01:53:51.824 --> 01:53:53.826
CIVIL RIGHTS HAS BEEN VIOLATED

01:53:53.893 --> 01:53:55.395
THE QUESTION AS A PRACTICAL

01:53:55.461 --> 01:53:58.398
MATTER THAT IS INFORMED BY A

01:53:58.464 --> 01:53:59.832
LONG HISTORY OF THE FEDERAL

01:53:59.899 --> 01:54:02.135
GOVERNMENT WITHOUT ABUSE SIR A

01:54:02.202 --> 01:54:04.671
PROCESS ISSUES OF WHAT. SHOULD

01:54:04.737 --> 01:54:06.039
THE ATTORNEY CLIENT PRIVILEGE

01:54:06.105 --> 01:54:09.576
MEANS IS THAT WE NEED THIS

01:54:09.642 --> 01:54:11.110
CONFIDENTIAL RELATIONSHIP.

01:54:11.177 --> 01:54:14.180
BETWEEN OUR AGENCY WHOSE JOB IT

01:54:14.247 --> 01:54:14.948
IS TO PROTECT PEOPLE CIVIL

01:54:15.014 --> 01:54:17.283
RIGHTS AND THE INDIVIDUAL WHO

01:54:17.350 --> 01:54:18.484
WAS ARTICULATED THIS WAS

01:54:18.551 --> 01:54:20.653
EXPRESSED OUR WITNESS TO BE THE

01:54:20.720 --> 01:54:22.722
REAL PARTY IN INTEREST. THE

01:54:22.789 --> 01:54:24.290
REAL PARTY IN INTEREST IN CASES

01:54:24.357 --> 01:54:25.425
IS REALLY WHAT YOU'RE TALKING

01:54:25.491 --> 01:54:27.894
ABOUT SO YOU CAN'T PROSECUTE

01:54:27.961 --> 01:54:29.696
THESE CASES IT'S LIKE HAVING A

01:54:29.762 --> 01:54:31.564
WITNESS PROTECTION PROGRAM OR

01:54:31.631 --> 01:54:33.099
VICTIM RIGHTS PROGRAM IN THE

01:54:33.166 --> 01:54:35.735
PEOPLE VERSUS AN INDIVIDUAL TO

01:54:35.802 --> 01:54:37.470
PROTECT THE PUBLIC SAFETY IT'S

01:54:37.537 --> 01:54:39.606
EXACTLY THE SAME THING. BUT THE

01:54:39.672 --> 01:54:42.308
QUESTION BECOMES HOW DO YOU DO

01:54:42.375 --> 01:54:44.577
THAT YOU HAVE TO HAVE THAT

01:54:44.644 --> 01:54:47.013
CONFIDENTIALITY OTHERWISE YOU

01:54:47.080 --> 01:54:49.682
COULD NEVER PROSECUTED CASE SO

01:54:49.749 --> 01:54:50.883
YOU COULD GET CAUGHT UP IN THE

01:54:50.950 --> 01:54:52.452
MEETING AND I DON'T THINK THE

01:54:52.518 --> 01:54:53.720
ANSWERS WITH RESPECT TO

01:54:53.786 --> 01:54:55.221
COLLECTIVE BARGAINING IT ALL

01:54:55.288 --> 01:54:56.990
APPLIES TO THIS DIAGNOSTIC.

01:54:57.056 --> 01:54:59.559
BECAUSE THE ONLY WAY THIS WORKS

01:54:59.626 --> 01:55:01.427
IS NOT EXPANSION THIS IS A

01:55:01.494 --> 01:55:03.096
CLARIFICATION THAT IS WAS

01:55:03.162 --> 01:55:04.430
INDICATED BY THEIR TECHNICAL

01:55:04.497 --> 01:55:06.733
ADVISER IS NECESSARY BY THE

01:55:06.799 --> 01:55:08.201
CONFUSION CREATED BY THE COURT

01:55:08.268 --> 01:55:11.437
IN SAN DIEGO. AND IT IS ALSO AS

01:55:11.504 --> 01:55:14.040
A FINAL POINT RATE THIS IS NOT

01:55:14.107 --> 01:55:16.309
INVENTING SOMETHING NEW THIS IS

01:55:16.376 --> 01:55:18.811
NOT A BROAD EXPANSION OF WHAT

01:55:18.878 --> 01:55:20.213
WE MEAN BY ATTORNEY CLIENT

01:55:20.280 --> 01:55:23.383
PRIVILEGE. THIS IS SIMPLY WHAT

01:55:23.449 --> 01:55:24.884
HAS BEEN TRIED IN TO THE

01:55:24.951 --> 01:55:26.919
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND THE ONLY

01:55:26.986 --> 01:55:29.555
REASON I STAND BEFORE YOU TODAY

01:55:29.622 --> 01:55:31.524
IS BECAUSE ONE COURT IN SAN

01:55:31.591 --> 01:55:33.893
DIEGO MADE A DECISION TO VERY A

01:55:33.960 --> 01:55:37.297
VERY AWAY FROM THAT. AND THAT

01:55:37.363 --> 01:55:40.199
THIS. T. THAT CREATED IN. FIFTY

01:55:40.266 --> 01:55:41.367
NINE IN CALIFORNIA TO PROTECT

01:55:41.434 --> 01:55:42.902
PEOPLE CIVIL RIGHTS COULD

01:55:42.969 --> 01:55:45.071
CONTINUE TO DO SO. I THINK THAT

01:55:45.138 --> 01:55:46.873
REALLY ADDRESSES IT SHOWS THAT

01:55:46.939 --> 01:55:48.441
ITS MAINSTAY THIS IS NOT SOME

01:55:48.508 --> 01:55:51.311
ABERRATION BUT ISN'T SOME WILD.

01:55:51.377 --> 01:55:52.645
INTERPRETATION OF WHAT WE MEAN

01:55:52.712 --> 01:55:54.547
&lt;c.green&gt;Y THIRTY CLIMB PRIVILEGE AND&lt;/c&gt;

01:55:54.614 --> 01:55:55.848
THAT IN FACT THE REAL

01:55:55.915 --> 01:55:56.482
INTERPRETATION IT WAS

01:55:56.549 --> 01:55:57.950
PROBLEMATIC WHAT IS IN THE

01:55:58.017 --> 01:56:01.120
WORST CASE ON JANUARY TWENTIETH

01:56:01.187 --> 01:56:03.189
TWENTY TWENTY ONE. THANK YOU.

01:56:03.256 --> 01:56:07.460

GO HEAD TO THE BOARD THANK YOU-

01:56:10.330 --> 01:56:11.998
AND I AND I BELIEVE THAT THERE

01:56:12.065 --> 01:56:14.867
ARE REAL MERITS TO LOOKING

01:56:14.934 --> 01:56:17.270
AFTER THE PUBLIC GOOD. BUT

01:56:17.337 --> 01:56:20.173
THERE MUST BE MECHANISMS THAT

01:56:20.239 --> 01:56:22.075
COULD BE CREATED THAT WOULD

01:56:22.141 --> 01:56:25.378
ALLOW FOR CONFIDENTIAL ASK.

01:56:25.445 --> 01:56:27.413
PROTECTIONS FOR COMMUNICATIONS

01:56:27.480 --> 01:56:29.816
WITHOUT MOVING IN THE DIRECTION

01:56:29.882 --> 01:56:33.052
OF. ATTORNEY CLIENT PROTECTIONS

01:56:33.119 --> 01:56:37.824
IN PRIVILEGE. WOULD THAT NOT BE

01:56:37.890 --> 01:56:40.760
A VIABLE ALTERNATIVE. TO THE

01:56:40.827 --> 01:56:44.263
CHAIR MR IS THE QUESTION I

01:56:44.330 --> 01:56:46.399
DON'T THINK SO I DON'T SEE WHY.

01:56:46.466 --> 01:56:49.102
BECAUSE WE HAVE A LONG BODY OF

01:56:49.168 --> 01:56:50.837
THE HISTORY OF THE BODY OF LAW

01:56:50.903 --> 01:56:52.939
OF WHAT IT MEANS I GET YOUR

01:56:53.005 --> 01:56:53.639
POINT WE COULD CREATE SOME

01:56:53.706 --> 01:56:56.242
HYBRID. SOME NEW KIND OF MODEL

01:56:56.309 --> 01:56:57.410
THAT SAYS WELL THIS ISN'T

01:56:57.477 --> 01:56:58.478
TECHNICALLY ATTORNEY CLIENT

01:56:58.544 --> 01:56:59.979
PRIVILEGE BUT WE WOULD BE

01:57:00.046 --> 01:57:01.748
LITIGATING THIS FROM HERE TO

01:57:01.814 --> 01:57:03.750
THE HEAVENS. WE HAVE A

01:57:03.816 --> 01:57:06.152
PRINCIPLE IT IT ONLY APPLIES

01:57:06.219 --> 01:57:07.453
ONE WAY IT'S ONLY FOR ONE

01:57:07.520 --> 01:57:09.455
LIMITED PURPOSE. AND I WOULD

01:57:09.522 --> 01:57:11.891
SUGGEST TO YOU THAT IF WE

01:57:11.958 --> 01:57:13.793
DIDN'T HAVE THE SAME PROCESS.

01:57:13.860 --> 01:57:15.261
THAT HAS BEEN IN THE LAW ON THE

01:57:15.328 --> 01:57:16.829
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT FOR MANY

01:57:16.896 --> 01:57:19.098
YEARS WITH THE- THE EEOC THE

01:57:19.165 --> 01:57:19.966
COMPLIMENT OPPORTUNITY

01:57:20.032 --> 01:57:22.168
COMMISSION. WHICH HAS A SIMILAR

01:57:22.235 --> 01:57:23.603
RESPONSIBILITIES THAT WE HAVE

01:57:23.669 --> 01:57:24.937
HERE IN CALIFORNIA TO PROTECT

01:57:25.004 --> 01:57:26.939
PEOPLE CIVIL RIGHTS. I WOULD

01:57:27.006 --> 01:57:28.941
SAY YOU MIGHT HAVE A POINT. BUT

01:57:29.008 --> 01:57:30.443
IT'S SOMETHING THAT IT'S BEEN

01:57:30.510 --> 01:57:32.512
IN THE LAW FOR A LONG TIME ONE

01:57:32.578 --> 01:57:34.447
COURT CASE CAME DOWN. THROUGH

01:57:34.514 --> 01:57:37.116
SOME CONFUSION. OUR JOB IN THIS

01:57:37.183 --> 01:57:38.785
BRANCH OF GOVERNMENT IS TO

01:57:38.851 --> 01:57:40.386
CLARIFY THAT COMPETED TECH

01:57:40.453 --> 01:57:42.355
INFUSION AND MAKE SURE. THAT

01:57:42.422 --> 01:57:43.423
THE WAY THE LAW SHOULD BE

01:57:43.489 --> 01:57:44.791
INTERPRETED AND THAT IS TO

01:57:44.857 --> 01:57:45.992
PROTECT THE LITTLE GUY WHO

01:57:46.058 --> 01:57:47.860

MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE TAKEN

01:57:53.766 --> 01:57:55.034
CARE OF AND THAT THERE DOES NO

01:57:55.101 --> 01:57:56.402
CHILLING EFFECT ON THEIR

01:57:56.469 --> 01:57:58.438
ABILITY TO COME FORTH TO

01:57:58.504 --> 01:58:01.507
EXPLAIN. AND STAND UP FOR THEIR

01:58:01.574 --> 01:58:03.376
BREACH OF THEIR CIVIL RIGHTS.

01:58:03.443 --> 01:58:05.678
INJUSTICE CLARIFICATION AND

01:58:05.745 --> 01:58:08.214
JUSTICE CLARIFICATION- IN THE

01:58:08.281 --> 01:58:11.784
CIVIL RIGHTS- CONTEXT. THE

01:58:11.851 --> 01:58:14.720
HOLDER OF THE PRIVILEGE. IS THE

01:58:14.787 --> 01:58:18.357
GOVERNMENT. FOR THE INDIVIDUAL.

01:58:18.424 --> 01:58:21.227
THE GUY. OKAY SO THAT'S WHAT

01:58:21.294 --> 01:58:22.295
YOU'RE DOING YOU'RE BASICALLY

01:58:22.361 --> 01:58:23.796
THE GOVERNMENT'S JOB IS A

01:58:23.863 --> 01:58:25.998
PUBLIC POLCY TO THE CHAIR. IS

01:58:26.065 --> 01:58:28.935
TO PROTECT. CIVIL RIGHTS THAT'S

01:58:29.001 --> 01:58:30.937
EIGHT STATED CRITICAL DEVELOP

01:58:31.003 --> 01:58:33.172
PURPOSE OF OUR LAW IN

01:58:33.239 --> 01:58:35.341
CALIFORNIA FOR SEVENTY YEARS

01:58:35.408 --> 01:58:38.444
SIXTY YEARS. THAT'S THEY HOLD

01:58:38.511 --> 01:58:40.480
THAT THAT'S AND THEY NEED TO

01:58:40.546 --> 01:58:41.280
HOLD IT TO GIVE THE PERSON

01:58:41.347 --> 01:58:42.782
CONFIDENCE SO IN THIS

01:58:42.849 --> 01:58:44.817
PARTICULAR CONTEXT THE HOLDER

01:58:44.884 --> 01:58:46.552
OF THE PRIVILEGE WOULD BE THE-

01:58:46.619 --> 01:58:48.521
DIVISION OF THE STATE AND NOT

01:58:48.588 --> 01:58:52.925
THE INDIVIDUAL- YEAH. SO IN A

01:58:52.992 --> 01:58:55.895
TREE CLIENT PRIVILEGE. THE

01:58:55.962 --> 01:58:58.431
CLIENT HOLDS THE PRIVILEGE. SO

01:58:58.498 --> 01:58:59.899
THIS IS NOT ATTORNEY CLIENT

01:58:59.966 --> 01:59:01.667
PRIVILEGE BY VIRTUE OF THE FACT

01:59:01.734 --> 01:59:02.401
THAT THE HOLDER OF THE

01:59:02.468 --> 01:59:05.505
PRIVILEGE IS NOT THE PRINCIPLE

01:59:05.571 --> 01:59:07.573
AND WHAT THE INSTRUMENT MEANING

01:59:07.640 --> 01:59:09.375
THAT THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE

01:59:09.442 --> 01:59:13.546
OR THE EOC OR THE- ANY

01:59:13.613 --> 01:59:15.047
VARIATION OF THE DIVISION OF

01:59:15.114 --> 01:59:17.383
THE STATE. HOW DOES HOW DO YOU

01:59:17.450 --> 01:59:19.085
RECONCILE US GENERAL DURING THE

01:59:19.151 --> 01:59:20.553
PRIVILEGES NOT MATTER THAT'S

01:59:20.620 --> 01:59:21.587
THAT'S A DISTINCTION WITHOUT A

01:59:21.654 --> 01:59:23.489
DIFFERENCE SENATOR THAT'S A

01:59:23.556 --> 01:59:24.390
DISTINCTION WITHOUT A

01:59:24.457 --> 01:59:26.192
DIFFERENCE IT DOESN'T MATTER

01:59:26.259 --> 01:59:28.327
WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH

01:59:28.394 --> 01:59:29.629
IS THAT GOVERNMENT CAN SERVE

01:59:29.695 --> 01:59:31.531
ITS PURPOSE THAT THE INDIVIDUAL

01:59:31.597 --> 01:59:33.766
WHO'S GETTING HURT CAN BE COULD

01:59:33.833 --> 01:59:36.168
HAVE COMFORT. THAT THEY'RE NOT

01:59:36.235 --> 01:59:38.404
GOING TO BE UP THEIR

01:59:38.471 --> 01:59:39.839
CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION WHEN

01:59:39.906 --> 01:59:41.040
THEY'RE TRYING TO PREPARE THEIR

01:59:41.107 --> 01:59:42.475
CASE IS GOING TO BE ADVERSELY

01:59:42.542 --> 01:59:44.110
USED AGAINST THEM AND THE

01:59:44.176 --> 01:59:45.177
GOVERNMENT'S PURPOSE IS GOING

01:59:45.244 --> 01:59:47.113
TO BE SERVED AND SO IT'S AN

01:59:47.179 --> 01:59:49.181
ARGUMENT WHERE THEORETICALLY

01:59:49.248 --> 01:59:51.417
YOU CAN SAY WELL AS I GUESS THE

01:59:51.484 --> 01:59:52.518
MOST AND THE MOST IMPORTANT

01:59:52.585 --> 01:59:55.321
THING IS THAT. THE DEFINITION

01:59:55.388 --> 01:59:58.057
OF CONFIDENTIALITY IS STEEPED

01:59:58.124 --> 02:00:00.126
IN THE LAW SO THAT THERE'S NO

02:00:00.192 --> 02:00:02.862
RISK TO THE INDIVIDUAL THAT YOU

02:00:02.929 --> 02:00:04.864
INVENTED SOME NEW THEORY BUT

02:00:04.931 --> 02:00:06.832
THAT THEY KNOW THAT THIS

02:00:06.899 --> 02:00:08.134
DEFINITION IS GOIG TO PROTECT

02:00:08.200 --> 02:00:10.436
THEM ALL RIGHT AND I NINE ONCE

02:00:10.503 --> 02:00:13.439
AGAIN I ABSOLUTELY RESPECT MY

02:00:13.506 --> 02:00:14.707
COLLEAGUE- BOARD MELANIE

02:00:14.774 --> 02:00:16.609
QUESTIONS. IN ALL FINISHED

02:00:16.676 --> 02:00:18.544
RIGHT HERE CHAIR THANK YOU IS

02:00:18.611 --> 02:00:20.012
THAT I BELIEVE THAT THERE IS A

02:00:20.079 --> 02:00:22.415
SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE ARE WHEN

02:00:22.481 --> 02:00:23.516
IT COMES TO ATTORNEY CLIENT

02:00:23.583 --> 02:00:25.384
PRIVILEGE THE HOLDER OF THE

02:00:25.451 --> 02:00:30.323
PRIVILEGE. IS DETERMINATIVE.

02:00:30.389 --> 02:00:31.390
AND IF THIS A HEALTH AND SAY

02:00:31.457 --> 02:00:33.125
MATTER FOR EXAMPLE SOMEONE

02:00:33.192 --> 02:00:34.493
COMES FORWARD WITH THE HEALTH

02:00:34.560 --> 02:00:36.929
VIOLATION ALLEGATION AGAINST A

02:00:36.996 --> 02:00:39.265
RESTAURANT YOU KNOW YOU CAN SEE

02:00:39.332 --> 02:00:41.634
HOW THIS TYPE OF ATTORNEY

02:00:41.701 --> 02:00:44.170
CLIENT ASK PROTECTION WE'LL

02:00:44.236 --> 02:00:45.871
BELIEVE NOT MAYBE THIS

02:00:45.938 --> 02:00:47.573
LEGISLATIVE CYCLE BUT IT WILL

02:00:47.640 --> 02:00:50.610
MOVE FORWARD- IN THE FUTURE AND

02:00:50.676 --> 02:00:52.645
I THINK IT WOULD DILUTE THE

02:00:52.712 --> 02:00:54.914
ESSENCE OF AN ATTORNEY AND A

02:00:54.981 --> 02:00:57.350
CLIENT RELATIONSHIP WITH THE

02:00:57.416 --> 02:00:59.619
EXPECTATION OF LEGAL SERVICE-

02:00:59.685 --> 02:01:01.153
SO. I WOULD I'M GONNA

SOME TYPE OF PROTECTION I

02:01:11.130 --> 02:01:12.498
BELIEVE IT SHOULD BE MORE IN

02:01:12.565 --> 02:01:13.633
THE FORM OF CONFIDENTIAL

02:01:13.699 --> 02:01:16.936

BACKGROUND. SO HISTORICALLY THE

ONLY WAY A BUSINESS CAN LEGALLY

03:31:18.866 --> 03:31:20.768
INFLUENCE AN ELECTION IS

03:31:20.834 --> 03:31:23.370
THROUGH CASH OR AN IN KIND

03:31:23.437 --> 03:31:25.606
CONTRIBUTION OR BY MAKING

03:31:25.672 --> 03:31:27.908

WHICH ARE COVERED BY F. PPC

03:31:30.544 --> 03:31:33.647
RULES AND ARE REPORTABLE.

03:31:33.714 --> 03:31:36.784
HOWEVER RECENT ADVANCES IN

03:31:36.850 --> 03:31:38.352
VARIOUS OF OUR INTERNET

03:31:38.419 --> 03:31:41.789
TECHNOLOGIES. MADE IT POSSIBLE

03:31:41.855 --> 03:31:43.891
FOR COMPANIES TO INDIVIDUALLY

03:31:43.957 --> 03:31:45.959
INFLUENCE VOTER BEHAVIOR BY

03:31:46.026 --> 03:31:48.762
CURATING THE ONLINE CONTENT WE

03:31:48.829 --> 03:31:52.933
SEE. AND SKEWING IT TOWARD A

03:31:53.000 --> 03:31:54.802
PARTICULAR POLITICAL STANCE.

03:31:54.868 --> 03:31:56.303
OUR ELECTION LAWS HAVE NOT

03:31:56.370 --> 03:31:58.439
CAUGHT UP WITH THE ADVANCEMENT

03:31:58.505 --> 03:32:02.676
OF THE INTERNET. SO THAT ONLINE

03:32:02.743 --> 03:32:06.480
BUSINESSES THAT USE OUR INFO.

03:32:06.547 --> 03:32:07.981
SO IT'S NORMAL THAT THEY WOULD

03:32:08.048 --> 03:32:09.983
USE OUR INFO FOR EXAMPLE IF YOU

03:32:10.050 --> 03:32:11.952
BUY POLITICAL AD YOU'RE

03:32:12.019 --> 03:32:13.520
TARGETING THEIR POLITICAL AD

03:32:13.587 --> 03:32:15.589
TOWARDS CERTAIN PEOPLE THAT'S

03:32:15.656 --> 03:32:17.191
WITH THAT SO YOU KNOW WHERE

03:32:17.257 --> 03:32:21.795
EVEN A- A PRODUCT DAD. AND THE

03:32:21.862 --> 03:32:23.097
INTERNET SITES HAVE THE

03:32:23.163 --> 03:32:25.632
CAPABILITY TO DO THAT. HOWEVER

03:32:25.699 --> 03:32:27.801
THEIR ONLINE BUSINESSES THAT

03:32:27.868 --> 03:32:31.071
USE THAT SAME TARGETED INFO TO

03:32:31.138 --> 03:32:33.941
STEER INFORMATION THAT IS NOT A

03:32:34.007 --> 03:32:36.110
PAID POLITICAL AD. THAT THEN

03:32:36.176 --> 03:32:38.479
SUPPORTS OR OPPOSES A CANDIDATE

03:32:38.545 --> 03:32:40.848
OR A MEASURE. AND WHEN THEY DO

03:32:40.914 --> 03:32:42.116
THAT IT IS NOT CURRENTLY

03:32:42.182 --> 03:32:46.153
REPORTABLE. SO WHAT SB SEVEN

03:32:46.220 --> 03:32:50.023
FOUR SIX DOES. IS PROVIDES A

03:32:50.090 --> 03:32:52.326
REALITY CHECK FOR WE CONSUMERS

03:32:52.392 --> 03:32:54.228
AND RESTORES PUBLIC TRUST IN

03:32:54.294 --> 03:32:57.197
ONLINE CONTENT BY ALLOWING US

03:32:57.264 --> 03:32:58.732
TO KNOW IF WE'RE BEING

03:32:58.799 --> 03:33:00.467
POLITICALLY TARGETED IT ALLOWS

03:33:00.534 --> 03:33:01.802
THE CONSUMERS PERSONAL

03:33:01.869 --> 03:33:03.570

03:33:03.637 --> 03:33:05.639
POLITICAL PURPOSE REQUEST

03:33:05.706 --> 03:33:07.808
REPORT FROM THAT BUSINESS AS TO

03:33:07.875 --> 03:33:10.444
HOW THAT INFO WAS USED REQUIRES

03:33:10.511 --> 03:33:12.846
A BUSINESS TO DISCLOSE TO THE

WHICH THEY'VE USED PERFORMED

03:33:20.654 --> 03:33:22.489
PERSONAL INFO FOR AND WHAT THE

03:33:22.556 --> 03:33:24.892
PURPOSE WAS. AND REQUIRES THE

I KNOW LIKE EVERYBODY ELSE WE

03:40:21.741 --> 03:40:24.077
DON'T LIKE BEING TARGETED BASED

03:40:24.144 --> 03:40:25.912
ON OUR METRICS ARE INFORMATION

03:40:25.979 --> 03:40:30.483
IN OUR HISTORY AND PROFILE- IT

03:40:30.550 --> 03:40:32.285
IS KIND OF A NEW REALITY THAT

03:40:32.352 --> 03:40:34.321
WE'RE HAVING TO CONFRONT. AS A

03:40:34.387 --> 03:40:36.990
PRACTICAL MATTER HOW IT IS PRE

03:40:37.057 --> 03:40:39.693
AGGREGATED INFORMATION PLEA IN

THIS SCENARIO WITH THIS

03:40:41.728 --> 03:40:44.497
REQUIRED THE DISAGGREGATION OF

03:40:44.564 --> 03:40:47.334
ALREADY ACCUMULATED INFORMATION.

03:40:47.400 --> 03:40:48.301
THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION THIS

03:40:48.368 --> 03:40:50.036
DOES NOT PREVENT THE TARGETING

03:40:50.103 --> 03:40:52.472
I THINK THAT WE CERTAINLY- WELL

03:40:52.539 --> 03:40:54.908
SOME OF US MAY OBJECT TO THE

03:40:54.975 --> 03:40:57.143
THAT TARGETING THAT IS THE CORE

03:40:57.210 --> 03:40:58.545
OF MANY OF THESE ONLINE

03:40:58.612 --> 03:41:01.114
ENTERPRISES BUSINESS. SO DOES

03:41:01.181 --> 03:41:02.515
NOT PREVENT THAT WHATSOEVER

03:41:02.582 --> 03:41:05.185
WHAT IT DOES IS AND IN FACT

03:41:05.251 --> 03:41:07.120
MANY OF US WHO RUN FOR OFFICE

03:41:07.187 --> 03:41:10.390
BY WEB ADS FOR EXAMPLE AND WE

03:41:10.457 --> 03:41:12.726
DO SO. UNDERSTANDING THAT THEY

03:41:12.792 --> 03:41:14.361
WILL BE TARGETED AND WE EVEN

03:41:14.427 --> 03:41:16.963
DIRECT THE PARAMETERS- WHAT

03:41:17.030 --> 03:41:19.232
THIS IS TRYING TO PREVENT IS

03:41:19.299 --> 03:41:21.601
THAT TARGETING THAT THE COMPANY

03:41:21.668 --> 03:41:24.004
ITSELF CHOOSES TO DO. THAT IS

03:41:24.070 --> 03:41:26.172
NOT A POLITICAL AD. AND THUS IS

03:41:26.239 --> 03:41:28.308
NOT REPORTABLE SO THAT IF THEY

03:41:28.375 --> 03:41:30.276
DO THAT THEN IT IT MUST BE

03:41:30.343 --> 03:41:32.278
REPORTABLE SO IF THEY DO

03:41:32.345 --> 03:41:35.815
TARGETING ON BEHALF OF. A

03:41:35.882 --> 03:41:37.083
CERTAIN BALLOT MEASURE

03:41:37.150 --> 03:41:38.551

03:41:38.618 --> 03:41:40.654
EXPLICIT ELECTORAL POLITICAL

03:41:40.720 --> 03:41:43.256
PURPOSE WHICH WOULD OTHERWISE

03:41:43.323 --> 03:41:44.424
BE COVERED UNDER OUR REPORTING

03:41:44.491 --> 03:41:46.126
LAWS. THEY WOULD HAVE TO REPORT

03:41:46.192 --> 03:41:48.995
THAT. IS IT JUST A

03:41:49.062 --> 03:41:51.631
CLARIFICATION SO IN THE LAST

03:41:51.698 --> 03:41:52.632
FIVE YEARS THERE'S BEEN AN

03:41:52.699 --> 03:41:53.967
ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF DATA

03:41:54.034 --> 03:41:57.137
COLLECTED IN IT IT EXISTS

03:41:57.203 --> 03:42:00.040
EITHER PHYSICALLY ON. IN

03:42:00.106 --> 03:42:01.675
SOFTWARE OR IN THE CLOUD. WHAT

03:42:01.741 --> 03:42:02.842

INFORMATION STILL BE USE RIGHT

03:42:10.250 --> 03:42:10.684
NOW OR WOULD HAVE TO BE

03:42:10.750 --> 03:42:13.420
DISAGGREGATED- I DON'T BELIEVE

03:42:13.486 --> 03:42:14.688
IT WOULD BE REQUIRED TO BE

03:42:14.754 --> 03:42:16.723
DISAGREED I THINK IT'S WHAT

03:42:16.790 --> 03:42:18.892

03:42:29.235 --> 03:42:30.603
THAT'S GOING TO GET STEERED

03:42:30.670 --> 03:42:34.374
TOWARDS- YOU KNOW LET'S SAY IF

03:42:34.441 --> 03:42:35.709
IT'S A BUNCH OF DEMOCRATIC

03:42:35.775 --> 03:42:37.143
CLUBS THAT ARE SEEING-

03:42:37.210 --> 03:42:38.278
EVERYBODY SHOULD VOTE FOR X. OR

03:42:38.344 --> 03:42:40.380
Y. AND IT'S BEEN CLEAR IN MY

SPEND NOT STUFF MIGHT POP UP.

03:42:48.088 --> 03:42:50.523
ON MY FEET RIGHT THERE'S

03:42:50.590 --> 03:42:51.157
NOTHING IN THIS BILL THAT WOULD

03:42:51.224 --> 03:42:53.927
PREVENT THAT IT'S IF THE

03:42:53.993 --> 03:42:57.263
COMPANY ITSELF CREATES CONTENT.

03:42:57.330 --> 03:42:59.999
OR STEERS CONTENT. OF THEIR OWN

03:43:00.066 --> 03:43:02.368
SO. THAT EXAMPLE A GREAT

03:43:02.435 --> 03:43:04.604
EXAMPLE WOULD BE. IF YOU HAD

03:43:04.671 --> 03:43:09.309

PARTICULARLY IN THE LAST TWELVE

04:01:11.523 --> 04:01:12.424
MONTHS PEOPLE DON'T GO INTO A

04:01:12.491 --> 04:01:14.226
DEALERSHIP. PEOPLE PURCHASE A

04:01:14.293 --> 04:01:16.528

ADDRESS THOSE CONCERNS. I THINK

04:01:31.577 --> 04:01:32.911
THE PRIMARY CONCERNS ARE WHEN

04:01:32.978 --> 04:01:34.746

04:01:34.813 --> 04:01:36.548

04:01:38.984 --> 04:01:40.853
SOMEHOW THE- SALES PERSON IS

04:01:40.919 --> 04:01:42.754

ALREADY PROHIBITED BY LAW BUT

04:02:43.515 --> 04:02:45.484
THE AG'S OPPOSITION TO THIS IS

04:02:45.550 --> 04:02:48.353
THAT THIS. ELECTRONIC MEDIUM IS

04:02:48.420 --> 04:02:50.656
CORRECT THE REASON IT WASN'T

04:02:50.722 --> 04:02:53.592

WRONGFUL ACTS THEY'VE BEEN DONE

04:07:03.508 --> 04:07:04.676
BY THE MILITARY AS AN

04:07:04.743 --> 04:07:07.279
INSTITUTION. SEGREGATION IN THE

04:07:07.345 --> 04:07:09.881
MILITARY AS EXISTS ANYWHERE WAS

04:07:09.948 --> 04:07:11.683
WRONG THAT WAS ABOLISHED IN THE

04:07:11.750 --> 04:07:13.385
LATE NINETEEN FORTIES-

04:07:13.451 --> 04:07:16.821
DISCRIMINATION AGAINST LGBTQ

04:07:16.888 --> 04:07:18.990
INDIVIDUALS THAT WAS WRONG.

04:07:19.057 --> 04:07:19.691
IT'S BEEN ABOLISHED

04:07:19.758 --> 04:07:21.293
DISCRIMINATION IN BEIJING

04:07:21.359 --> 04:07:24.095
AGAINST TRANSGENDER INDIVIDUALS

04:07:24.162 --> 04:07:24.596
THAT WAS WRONG IT'S BEEN

04:07:24.663 --> 04:07:28.400
ABOLISHED. THE QUESTION NOW IS

04:07:28.466 --> 04:07:30.335
FOR THE TWENTY TWO YEAR OLD

04:07:30.402 --> 04:07:33.205
SERVICE MEMBERS LEAVING SERVICE

04:07:33.271 --> 04:07:34.940
DO WE WANT TO PROVIDE THAT

04:07:35.006 --> 04:07:36.141
TRANSITION DO WE WANT TO

04:07:36.208 --> 04:07:38.243
PROVIDE THAT ADDITIONAL

04:07:38.310 --> 04:07:40.011
OPPORTUNITY I THINK THE ANSWER

04:07:40.078 --> 04:07:44.482
IS YES OUR MILITARY- TODAY IS

04:07:44.549 --> 04:07:46.351
HAS AN OVER REPRESENTATION OF

04:07:46.418 --> 04:07:47.452
CERTAIN GROUPS FOR EXAMPLE

04:07:47.519 --> 04:07:48.687
AFRICAN AMERICANS ARE

04:07:48.753 --> 04:07:50.188
OVERREPRESENTED AS COMPARED TO

04:07:50.255 --> 04:07:51.156
THE GENERAL POPULATION THE SAME

04:07:51.223 --> 04:07:52.591
THING WITH WITH LATINOS THEY'RE

04:07:52.657 --> 04:07:54.893
OVER REPRESENTED AS COMPARED TO

04:07:54.960 --> 04:07:57.996
THE- GENERALPOPULATION. WOMEN

04:07:58.063 --> 04:07:59.965
COMPRISE A SMALLER PORTION OF

04:08:00.031 --> 04:08:01.967
THE MILITARY- AS WOULD BE

04:08:02.033 --> 04:08:04.369
TESTIFIED BY MY WIFE MILITARY

04:08:04.436 --> 04:08:07.272

04:08:08.306 --> 04:08:10.742
YEARS THAT IS DIFFERENT TODAY

04:08:10.809 --> 04:08:12.410
THAT IS DIFFERENT TODAY THE

04:08:12.477 --> 04:08:13.979
QUESTION IS AGAIN DO WE WANT TO

04:08:14.045 --> 04:08:15.513
PROVIDE THAT KIND OF SUPPORT TO

04:08:15.580 --> 04:08:17.315
A VETERAN WHO'S LEAVING SERVICE

04:08:17.382 --> 04:08:18.450

04:08:18.516 --> 04:08:20.919

04:08:34.099 --> 04:08:35.500
KIND OF SUPPORT IS WELL

04:08:35.567 --> 04:08:36.935
VETERANS HAVE A HIGHER HOMELESS

04:08:37.002 --> 04:08:38.470
POPULATION AND THEY HAVE A

04:08:38.536 --> 04:08:39.304
HIGHER SUICIDE RATE THAN THE

04:08:39.371 --> 04:08:41.539
GENERAL POPULATION. AND SO AS A

04:08:41.606 --> 04:08:43.241
SOCIETAL GOOD I THINK WE SHOULD

04:22:51.255 --> 04:22:53.190
I'VE SPENT MY LIFE FIGHTING

04:22:53.257 --> 04:22:54.758
AGAINST DISCRIMINATION.

04:22:54.825 --> 04:22:56.360
FIGHTING TO MAKE SURE THAT

04:22:56.427 --> 04:22:59.763
THOSE GROUPS OF. AMERICANS ARE

04:22:59.830 --> 04:23:02.366
NOT. DO NOT CONTINUE TO BE

04:23:02.433 --> 04:23:04.368
EXCLUDED AND DISCRIMINATED AND

04:23:04.435 --> 04:23:05.803
PUT AT THE BOTTOM OF THE LIST

04:23:05.870 --> 04:23:08.005
WHILE OTHERS KEEP RISING TO THE

04:23:08.072 --> 04:23:12.376
TOP. SO IT'S- IT'S DIFFICULT-

04:23:12.443 --> 04:23:15.379
ON THIS SO I WOULD REALLY URGE-

04:23:15.446 --> 04:23:17.281
WORDS THE AUTHORED TO AS YOU

04:23:17.348 --> 04:23:19.683
ARE. GOING TO MEET WITH THEM

04:23:19.750 --> 04:23:21.552
THOSE WHO THOSE OF US WHO HAVE

04:23:21.619 --> 04:23:26.056
CONCERNS- THAT WE DO ALL WE CAN

04:23:26.123 --> 04:23:29.493
TO- NOT ALLOWED DISPARATE

04:23:29.560 --> 04:23:34.198
IMPACT. ON ALL ON OTHER GROUPS-

04:23:34.265 --> 04:23:36.767
AND THAT WE LOOK FOR WAYS OF

04:23:36.834 --> 04:23:41.539
ADDRESSING. THAT ISSUE- IDEA I

04:23:41.605 --> 04:23:43.674
WILL SUPPORT THE BILL TODAY BUT

04:23:43.741 --> 04:23:46.110
I REALLY WANT US TO ADDRESS

04:23:46.177 --> 04:23:48.612
THAT- THAT'S WHAT I HAVE TO

04:23:48.679 --> 04:23:50.781
SAY. OKAY THANK YOU SENATOR

04:23:50.848 --> 04:23:54.351
ALSO CENTER WHAT CASKEY AND

04:23:54.418 --> 04:23:55.486
THEN CENTER WIENER. I'M LOOKING

04:23:55.553 --> 04:23:56.387
AROUND I THINK I'M THE ONLY

04:23:56.453 --> 04:23:58.389
PERSON THAT IS VOTED NO ON THIS

04:23:58.455 --> 04:24:00.124
BILL THREE TIMES SO. THERE'S

04:24:00.191 --> 04:24:01.725
OMETHING TO BE SAID ABOUT

04:24:01.792 --> 04:24:04.261
BEING HERE FOR A WHILE.

04:24:04.328 --> 04:24:06.297
OPPOSITION RAISES A POINT ABOUT

04:24:06.363 --> 04:24:07.598
THE LANGUAGE IN THE BILL RIGHT

04:24:07.665 --> 04:24:09.200
NOW BEING A COMPLETE DEFENSE

04:24:09.266 --> 04:24:12.169
AGAINST- WHAT WOULD ORDINARILY

04:24:12.236 --> 04:24:14.738
BE UNLAWFUL DISCRIMINATION.

04:24:14.805 --> 04:24:15.272
HAVE A COMMENT ON THAT THE

04:24:15.339 --> 04:24:19.877
AUTHOR- AND I'VE HEARD THE

04:24:19.944 --> 04:24:21.478
CONCERN THAT SOMEHOW THIS BILL

04:24:21.545 --> 04:24:23.948
BE USED AS A SUBTERFUGE FOR

04:24:24.014 --> 04:24:26.283
HIRING YOU KNOW A CERTAIN KIND

04:24:26.350 --> 04:24:28.152
OF WHITE MALES FOR EXAMPLE IT'S

04:24:28.219 --> 04:24:29.620
A SUBTERFUGE FOR HIRING WHITE

04:24:29.687 --> 04:24:30.688
MALES TO THE EXTENT THERE CAN

04:24:30.754 --> 04:24:32.189
BE LANGUAGE IT SAYS IF YOU'RE

04:24:32.256 --> 04:24:34.491
USING THIS IN A WAY THAT THE

04:24:34.558 --> 04:24:36.393
SUBTERFUGE TO HIRE WHITE MALES

04:24:36.460 --> 04:24:37.494
THEN I'LL CERTAINLY

04:24:37.561 --> 04:24:39.129
ENTERTAINING I'M NOT SURE WHAT

04:24:39.196 --> 04:24:41.832
THAT LANGUAGE IS IF THE CONCERN

04:24:41.899 --> 04:24:44.735
IS AN AND THE OPPONENTS SAY

04:24:44.802 --> 04:24:46.804
LOOK AT UNTIL THE MILITARY IS

04:24:46.870 --> 04:24:49.607
50% FEMALE 50% MALE. THAT'S NOT

04:24:49.673 --> 04:24:50.841
ATTAINABLE GOAL FOR A VARIETY

04:24:50.908 --> 04:24:52.643
OF REASONS IS TO SIMPLY NOT

04:24:52.710 --> 04:24:54.178
ATTAINABLE GOAL AND IF THEY'RE

04:24:54.245 --> 04:24:55.546
SAYING THE VETERAN POPULATION

04:24:55.613 --> 04:24:57.248
NEED BE FIFTY FIFTY THAT'S NOT

04:24:57.314 --> 04:24:58.849
ATTAINABLE GOAL IN THE NEXT

04:24:58.916 --> 04:25:01.018
HUNDRED YEARS OR SO BECAUSE THE

04:25:01.085 --> 04:25:03.354
RIGHT EFFECTS THEY'RE NO LONGER

04:25:03.420 --> 04:25:06.457
ARE THE BARS THAT ONCE EXISTED

04:25:06.523 --> 04:25:08.759
FOR EXAMPLE FOR WOMEN WILL HAVE

04:25:08.826 --> 04:25:10.361
A DISPARATE IMPACT IT WILL

04:25:10.427 --> 04:25:12.997
COULD IN FACT. GIVEN THE

04:25:13.063 --> 04:25:14.698
POPULATION THE MILITARY TODAY

04:25:14.765 --> 04:25:16.367
IT PROBABLY HAS A DISPARATE

04:25:16.433 --> 04:25:18.969
IMPACT IT PROBABLY IT FAVORS

04:25:19.036 --> 04:25:20.771
LATINOS BECAUSE THE LATINOS

04:25:20.838 --> 04:25:22.473
HAVE A LARGER PORTION OF THE

04:25:22.539 --> 04:25:23.374
MILITARY THAN THE GENERAL

04:25:23.440 --> 04:25:25.342
POPULATION IT FAVORS AFRICAN

04:25:25.409 --> 04:25:26.644
AMERICANS BECAUSE AFRICAN

04:25:26.710 --> 04:25:28.379
AMERICANS COMPRISE A LARGER

04:25:28.445 --> 04:25:29.947
PORTION MILITARY THAN THE

04:25:30.014 --> 04:25:31.982
GENERAL POPULATION WHICH IS

04:25:32.049 --> 04:25:33.651
SIMPLY A FACT AND IT'S A GOOD

04:25:33.717 --> 04:25:34.752
THING BY THE WAY I THINK IT IS

04:25:34.818 --> 04:25:36.387
A GOOD THING THAT THAT THAT THE

04:25:36.453 --> 04:25:38.656
MILITARY HAS A DISPROPORTIONATE

04:25:38.722 --> 04:25:39.890
NUMBER OF LATINOS A

04:25:39.957 --> 04:25:40.924
DISPROPORTIONATE NUMBER OF

04:25:40.991 --> 04:25:45.195
BLACKS BECAUSE IT IT EXPOSES

04:25:45.262 --> 04:25:50.901
FOLKS TO ONE ANOTHER. MODERATE

04:25:50.968 --> 04:25:52.970
ECONOMIC MEANS. IF YOU LOOK AT

04:25:53.037 --> 04:25:55.739
TODAY'S MILITARY. YOU'RE GOING

04:25:55.806 --> 04:25:57.574
TO FIND THAT PEOPLE JOIN THE

04:25:57.641 --> 04:25:58.809
MILITARY FOR A VARIETY OF

04:25:58.876 --> 04:26:01.312
REASONS MANY MANY MANY ARE

04:26:01.378 --> 04:26:03.947
BECAUSE OF ECONOMIC NECESSITY

04:26:04.014 --> 04:26:05.349
YOU KNOW I STUCK AROUND FOR A

04:26:05.416 --> 04:26:06.884
LONG TIME I COULDN'T GO TO

04:26:06.950 --> 04:26:08.052
COLLEGE BUT FOR THE MILITARY I

04:26:08.118 --> 04:26:11.922
SIMPLY WENT TO THE MILITARY FOR

04:26:11.989 --> 04:26:14.558
THE EDUCATION. NOT FOR THE

04:26:14.625 --> 04:26:17.394
REASONS LATER ON I DEVELOP SOME

04:26:17.461 --> 04:26:18.495
OTHER PASSIONS BUT I WENT TO

04:26:18.562 --> 04:26:20.264
THE MILITARY BECAUSE I WON A

04:26:20.331 --> 04:26:21.799
COLLEGE EDUCATION AND YOU'RE

04:26:21.865 --> 04:26:23.467
GOING TO FIND THAT PEOPLE IN

04:26:23.534 --> 04:26:26.737
THE MILITARY OVERWHELMINGLY ARE

04:26:26.804 --> 04:26:28.505
THERE BECAUSE THEY THEY- HAVE

04:26:28.572 --> 04:26:30.341
LIMITED CHOICES NOW I THINK

04:26:30.407 --> 04:26:31.475
MILITARY STRONG I THINK IT'S

04:26:31.542 --> 04:26:33.577
VERY IVERSE. I THINK IT'S GOT

04:26:33.644 --> 04:26:35.546
SOME INCREDIBLE HUMAN BEINGS.

04:26:35.612 --> 04:26:36.847
BUT BUT IT WILL HAVE A

04:26:36.914 --> 04:26:38.816
DISPARATE IMPACT IT WILL FAVOR

04:26:38.882 --> 04:26:40.718
LATINOS IT WILL FAVOR AFRICAN

04:26:40.784 --> 04:26:42.953
AMERICANS IT WILL FAVOR PEOPLE

04:26:43.020 --> 04:26:45.089
WHO WOULD OTHERWISE NO OTHER

04:26:45.155 --> 04:26:45.723
OPTIONS. THAT'S JUST THE WAY IT

04:26:45.789 --> 04:26:49.827
IS. WHAT ARE THE RECORD CARE

04:26:49.893 --> 04:26:52.730
ACT INSURANCE- I AB ARE YOU

04:26:52.796 --> 04:26:53.897
OPENING STATEMENT I APPLAUD

04:26:53.964 --> 04:26:56.700
THE- IDEA OF HAVING INCENTIVES

04:26:56.767 --> 04:26:58.068
FOR PEOPLE TO GO INTO THE

04:26:58.135 --> 04:26:58.969
MILITARY AND WE HAVE THIS CROSS

04:26:59.036 --> 04:27:02.072
SECTION OF. LGBT AND ALLY TINOS

04:27:02.139 --> 04:27:05.909
AND EVERYONE. THE AUTHOR AND

04:27:05.976 --> 04:27:07.211
ARE OF A CERTAIN AGE WE

04:27:07.277 --> 04:27:08.879
REMEMBER THAT THE REASON THAT

04:27:08.946 --> 04:27:10.714
WE HAVE LANGUAGE IN TODAY'S LAW

04:27:10.781 --> 04:27:12.316
WAS BECAUSE THE WAY THAT

04:27:12.383 --> 04:27:14.451
VETERANS WERE FIFTY. PEOPLE

04:27:14.518 --> 04:27:15.753
WERE TREATED WHEN THEY CAME

04:27:15.819 --> 04:27:17.521
BACK FROM THE VIETNAM WAR THERE

04:27:17.588 --> 04:27:19.022
WAS THE PREFERENCE THAT WE GAVE

04:27:19.089 --> 04:27:20.724
FOR VIETNAM VETERANS WHOSE

04:27:20.791 --> 04:27:22.493
BECAUSE PEOPLE SPECIFICALLY.

04:27:22.559 --> 04:27:23.827
THEY WERE QUALIFIED THEY WERE

04:27:23.894 --> 04:27:25.295
READY TO WIN AND THEY FOUND OUT

04:27:25.362 --> 04:27:26.697
THAT THEY WERE THE THEY WERE

04:27:26.764 --> 04:27:29.700
BEING DISCRIMINATED AGAINST AND

04:27:29.767 --> 04:27:32.169
THAT WAS JUST A RECENT JUSTICE.

04:27:32.236 --> 04:27:34.405
AT LEAST SCARE THE PRIVATE

04:27:34.471 --> 04:27:36.306
EMPLOYEES FOR IF THEY WERE.

04:27:36.373 --> 04:27:38.542
REGARDED THEY WERE INVOLVED IN

04:27:38.609 --> 04:27:40.244
THAT TYPE OF ACTIVITY. THAT'S

04:27:40.310 --> 04:27:42.045
NOT THE CASE NOW THAT'S NOT THE

04:27:42.112 --> 04:27:45.048
CASE THAT- WERE THE EVIDENCE

04:27:45.115 --> 04:27:47.084
THAT THERE ARE. PEOPLE FROM THE

04:27:47.151 --> 04:27:48.352
MILITARY BEING DISCRIMINATED

04:27:48.419 --> 04:27:51.021
AGAINST SO THE KITTY PUBLIC

04:27:51.088 --> 04:27:53.157
POLICY CURE FOR THE EXCEPTION

04:27:53.223 --> 04:27:57.694
OF WE HAVE NOW WAS A REAL-

04:27:57.761 --> 04:28:02.232
QUANTIFIABLE EVIDENCE THIS.

04:28:02.299 --> 04:28:03.667
WHERE IS THE EVIDENCE I GUESS

04:28:03.734 --> 04:28:05.102
IF EMPLOYERS WANT EMPLOYEES

04:28:05.169 --> 04:28:06.570
VETERANS THEYCAN DO THAT RIGHT

04:28:06.637 --> 04:28:08.038
NOW THERE'S NO HOME THERE IT'S

04:28:08.105 --> 04:28:09.673
I'VE NEVER HEARD IN THE RECENT

04:28:09.740 --> 04:28:11.175
YEARS THAT THERE'S SOME

04:28:11.241 --> 04:28:12.810
ACTIVITY THAT PEOPLE ARE NOT

04:28:12.876 --> 04:28:15.712
HIRING VETERANS. AT THE EXPENSE

04:28:15.779 --> 04:28:17.781
OF OTHER. QUALIFIED FOR THE

04:28:17.848 --> 04:28:20.851
FOLKS WHAT WOULD YOU SAY THE

04:28:20.918 --> 04:28:22.419
NUMBER NINE THERE ARE MORE THAN

04:28:22.486 --> 04:28:24.288
WILLING TO RESPOND TO THAT OR

04:28:24.354 --> 04:28:25.889
ADDRESS IT YOU'RE RIGHT ALLEN'S

04:28:25.956 --> 04:28:28.625
THIS POINT IN TIME THAT VETERAN

04:28:28.692 --> 04:28:30.761
UNEMPLOYMENT IS PROBABLY ON PAR

04:28:30.828 --> 04:28:32.129
AND MAYBE SLIGHTLY BETTER THAN

04:28:32.196 --> 04:28:34.097
THE GENERAL POPULATION TODAY

04:28:34.164 --> 04:28:35.799
BUT HISTORICALLY THAT IS NOT

04:28:35.866 --> 04:28:37.668
THE CASE IN YOUR RIGHTS IN A

04:28:37.734 --> 04:28:38.602
WHITE CAL SKI THINGS HAVE

04:28:38.669 --> 04:28:40.270
CHANGED DRAMATICALLY THE FIRST

04:28:40.337 --> 04:28:41.772
TIME I PUT ON A UNIFORM ON A

04:28:41.839 --> 04:28:43.273
COLLEGE CAMPUS IS A SEVENTEEN

04:28:43.340 --> 04:28:45.108
YEAR OLD SOMEONE CAME WARRANT

04:28:45.175 --> 04:28:46.677
SPIT UPON ME. WAS A DIFFERENT

04:28:46.743 --> 04:28:48.378
TIME WAS A DIFFERENT TIME. AS

04:28:48.445 --> 04:28:50.314
OPPOSED TO YOU KNOW TEN YEARS

04:28:50.380 --> 04:28:51.048
AGO COMING BACK FROM

04:28:51.114 --> 04:28:52.783
AFGHANISTAN. WHERE PEOPLE WERE

04:28:52.850 --> 04:28:54.952
LINED UP TO THANK YOU. A VERY

04:28:55.018 --> 04:28:56.787
DIFFERENT TIME BUT EVEN THOUGH

04:28:56.854 --> 04:28:58.322
FOLKS ARE LINED UP TO THANK

04:28:58.388 --> 04:28:59.456
YOU. I WAS IN A DIFFERENT

04:28:59.523 --> 04:29:01.358
POSITION BUT I DEALT WITH MANY

04:29:01.425 --> 04:29:03.527
YOUNG PEOPLE. MANY YOUNG PEOPLE

04:29:03.594 --> 04:29:05.329
WHO HAD A VERY DIFFICULT TIME

04:29:05.395 --> 04:29:07.531
TRANSITIONING. AND THAT'S WHAT

04:29:07.598 --> 04:29:09.766
THIS IS DESIGNED TO DO YES YES

04:29:09.833 --> 04:29:10.601
WE ARE HONORING THEIR

04:29:10.667 --> 04:29:13.070
SACRIFICE. YES WE ARE PROVIDING

04:29:13.136 --> 04:29:15.038
AN ADDITIONAL. POINT OF

04:29:15.105 --> 04:29:15.806
ASSISTANCE IN TERMS OF

04:29:15.873 --> 04:29:18.242
TRANSITION AND YES IT IS A

04:29:18.308 --> 04:29:20.010
SOCIETAL DECISION AS TO WHETHER

04:29:20.077 --> 04:29:20.911
OR NOT WE PROVIDE THAT

04:29:20.978 --> 04:29:23.113
INCENTIVE. IT'S IT IS I MEAN I

04:29:23.180 --> 04:29:25.148
RECOGNIZE THAT SOME. DON'T

04:29:25.215 --> 04:29:26.350
THINK THAT IT'S A GOOD IDEA. I

04:29:26.416 --> 04:29:29.987
DO. ONE FINAL QUESTION THE

04:29:30.053 --> 04:29:31.955
WHOLE MAIN OPPOSITION RAISED

04:29:32.022 --> 04:29:34.358
THE POINT THAT IN THE PUBLIC

04:29:34.424 --> 04:29:36.059
SECTOR WE HAVE MUCH MORE

04:29:36.126 --> 04:29:38.662
OVERSIGHT SO THAT THAT SOMEBODY

04:29:38.729 --> 04:29:40.764
A. D. E. D. YEARS NOT

04:29:40.831 --> 04:29:42.132
DISCRIMINATING ABOUTTHAT BUT

04:29:42.199 --> 04:29:43.200
IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR WE HAVE

04:29:43.267 --> 04:29:46.403
SO MANY MORE JOBS. AND THAT THE

04:29:46.470 --> 04:29:49.373
OPPORTUNITY FOR MISUSE OF THIS

04:29:49.439 --> 04:29:51.008
LAW THE INTENTION LAW IS

04:29:51.074 --> 04:29:54.111
GREATER- AND THAT MAYBE WE

04:29:54.177 --> 04:29:56.480
SHOULD. WELL IT IS IT'S A IT'S

04:29:56.547 --> 04:29:57.781
A POINT THAT THEY REYES AGAINST

04:29:57.848 --> 04:30:00.384
RESONATES WITH ME WILL WORK.

04:30:00.450 --> 04:30:01.818
HOW DO YOU HOW DO WE DEAL WITH

04:30:01.885 --> 04:30:04.388
THIS MORE OVERSIGHT IN THE FOR

04:30:04.454 --> 04:30:05.289
LACK OF OVERSIGHT IN THE

04:30:05.355 --> 04:30:07.324
DETECTOR THE SAME THE SAME

04:30:07.391 --> 04:30:08.191
POINT IS MADE EARLIER IF

04:30:08.258 --> 04:30:10.294

GO OUT AND HIRE WHITE MALES

04:30:31.682 --> 04:30:32.716
THEY DON'T NEED TO HIRE THEY

04:30:32.783 --> 04:30:33.617

COMMITMENT IS TRUST IN THIS- I

04:35:11.661 --> 04:35:15.565
THINK THAT THE A MALL LITTLE. I

04:35:15.632 --> 04:35:17.200
THINK THE DEBATE COULD PUT A

04:35:17.267 --> 04:35:18.902
FINER POINT ON SOME OF THESE

04:35:18.969 --> 04:35:23.907
ISSUES IF YOU LOOK AT THE. OUR

04:35:23.974 --> 04:35:28.845
IS A TELLING- THE AUTHOR THAT

04:35:28.912 --> 04:35:31.548
YEARS AGO WHEN I WORKED IN

04:35:31.615 --> 04:35:33.316
COUNTY MANAGEMENT WE HAD A

04:35:33.383 --> 04:35:35.852
VETERANS PREFERENCE AND YES

04:35:35.919 --> 04:35:37.821
THIS WAS AT THE TIME THAT

04:35:37.888 --> 04:35:40.223
DIVERSITY WAS NOT WHAT IT IS

04:35:40.290 --> 04:35:43.760
NOW IT IS IN IN THE MILITARY.

04:35:43.827 --> 04:35:46.363
AND WE HAD A RULE OF THREE SO

04:35:46.429 --> 04:35:49.532
WHENEVER A JOB WAS VACANT THE

04:35:49.599 --> 04:35:51.501
TOP THREE CANDIDATES WERE SENT

04:35:51.568 --> 04:35:52.769
BECAUSE THERE WAS A VETERANS

04:35:52.836 --> 04:35:55.805
PREFERENCE MANY TIMES ALL THE

04:35:55.872 --> 04:35:58.642
CANDIDATES BUNCHED TOGETHER THE

04:35:58.708 --> 04:35:59.576
THREE THAT WERE VETERANS MOVED

04:35:59.643 --> 04:36:01.811
TO THE TOP AT THE TIME THEY

04:36:01.878 --> 04:36:04.447
WERE ALMOST UNIFORMLY WHITE MEN

04:36:04.514 --> 04:36:05.782
AND WHEN WE WERE TRYING TO

04:36:05.849 --> 04:36:07.717
DIVERSIFY THE WORK FORCE THE

04:36:07.784 --> 04:36:09.519
VETERANS PREFERENCE WORKED

04:36:09.586 --> 04:36:14.257
AGAINST IT. AND SO WHEN OF WE

04:36:14.324 --> 04:36:16.626
DID A REFORM WE SAID THAT YOU

04:36:16.693 --> 04:36:19.296
SENT TEN NAMES ON EVERY LIST

04:36:19.362 --> 04:36:20.096
AND YOU HAVE TO INTERVIEW

04:36:20.163 --> 04:36:21.631
EVERYBODY THAT'S ABOVE WHOEVER

04:36:21.698 --> 04:36:23.233
YOU OFFER THE JOB TO AND AS A

04:36:23.300 --> 04:36:25.402
RESULT WE WERE ABLE TO REACH

04:36:25.468 --> 04:36:27.070
WOMEN BUT WERE MAKE SURE THE

04:36:27.137 --> 04:36:28.738
VETERANS WERE GIVEN A FAIR SHOT

04:36:28.805 --> 04:36:31.341
AND MANY TIMES THEY WERE. IN

04:36:31.408 --> 04:36:34.077
FACT HIRED. AND SO WHEN IT IS

04:36:34.144 --> 04:36:38.748
SAID IN THIS DEBATE THAT- IT

04:36:38.815 --> 04:36:40.250
YOU KNOW THERE'S NO INTENTIONAL

04:36:40.317 --> 04:36:42.118
DISCRIMINATION THAT WASN'T

04:36:42.185 --> 04:36:43.486
INTENTIONAL THAT WAS

04:36:43.553 --> 04:36:45.822
UNINTENTIONAL ALL THE WAY IN

04:36:45.889 --> 04:36:46.890
ONE INCIDENT WERE MAYBE YOU

04:36:46.957 --> 04:36:47.958
COULD PROTECT AGAINST

04:36:48.024 --> 04:36:49.726
SUBTERFUGE THERE WAS NO

04:36:49.793 --> 04:36:52.128
SUBTERFUGE THAT WAS CLEARLY

04:36:52.195 --> 04:36:53.930
SOMETHING THAT WAS HAPPENING ON

04:36:53.997 --> 04:36:55.999
THE BASIS OF HOW PEOPLE LINED

04:36:56.066 --> 04:36:58.268
UP. AN ENORMOUS EATING AND THE

04:36:58.335 --> 04:37:00.804
AUTHOR CAN CORRECT ME YOU SEE I

04:37:00.870 --> 04:37:01.972
THINK THE HEART OF THE DEBATE

04:37:02.038 --> 04:37:05.175
IS SET AT THAT TIME WE DID NOT

04:37:05.241 --> 04:37:08.411
HAVE A DIVERSE- OF CATEGORY OR

04:37:08.478 --> 04:37:10.680
GROUP OF VETERANS- WHILE THERE

04:37:10.747 --> 04:37:12.582
WERE SOME PEOPLE OF COLOR. THEY

04:37:12.649 --> 04:37:14.451
WERE OVERWHELMINGLY WHITE

04:37:14.517 --> 04:37:16.453
THEY'RE ALMOST ENTIRELY MEN

04:37:16.519 --> 04:37:18.555
THERE WAS NOBODY THAT WAS GAY

04:37:18.621 --> 04:37:19.923
THAT IF YOU WERE TRYING TO HAVE

04:37:19.990 --> 04:37:22.559
A DIVERSE WORK FORCE. VETERANS

04:37:22.625 --> 04:37:24.361
PREFERENCE WORKED AGAINST IT.

04:37:24.427 --> 04:37:27.597
AND YET NOW THE ARGUMENT THAT

04:37:27.664 --> 04:37:29.566
IS BEING MADE BY THE AUTHOR. IS

04:37:29.632 --> 04:37:31.401
THAT IF YOU LOOK WHO'S COMING

04:37:31.468 --> 04:37:33.570
OUT OF THE MILITARY RIGHT NOW

04:37:33.636 --> 04:37:35.305
IT'S VERY DIVERSE AND IT'S

04:37:35.372 --> 04:37:36.706
REPRESENTED ALMOST TO WHERE THE

04:37:36.773 --> 04:37:39.042
POPULATION IS. AND YET IF YOU

04:37:39.109 --> 04:37:41.144
LOOK AT THE ENTIRE POOL OF

04:37:41.211 --> 04:37:43.446
VETERANS THAT MAY APPLY THAT

04:37:43.513 --> 04:37:45.648
DIVERSITY DOESN'T EXIST AND IN

04:37:45.715 --> 04:37:47.884
THE IDEAL WORLD WE WOULD FIGURE

04:37:47.951 --> 04:37:49.786
OUT A WAY. THAT WE COULD GIVE

04:37:49.853 --> 04:37:51.388
SOME PREFERENCE TO THE PEOPLE

04:37:51.454 --> 04:37:53.656
COMING OUT OF THE MILITARY NOW

04:37:53.723 --> 04:37:55.091
AND WE WOULD NOT HAVE THE ISSUE

04:37:55.158 --> 04:37:58.161
THAT WE ARE ALL TALKING ABOUT.

04:37:58.228 --> 04:37:59.629
AND WHEN I WAS SECRETARY FOR

04:37:59.696 --> 04:38:01.765
NATURAL RESOURCES AND WE HAVE

04:38:01.831 --> 04:38:03.700
THE CONSERVATION CORPS WHICH

04:38:03.767 --> 04:38:05.435
REALLY WAS HELPING PEOPLE THAT

04:38:05.502 --> 04:38:07.070
WERE STRUGGLING WE HAVE

04:38:07.137 --> 04:38:10.240
DEDICATED. OUR OF PIECES OF THE

04:38:10.306 --> 04:38:11.808
CORD THAT WERE FOR TURNING

04:38:11.875 --> 04:38:15.278
VETERANS AND AS A RESULT- WE

04:38:15.345 --> 04:38:17.781
WERE ABLE TO HIRE OR TRAIN

04:38:17.847 --> 04:38:20.250
PEOPLE THAT THEN WENT TO HIRE.

04:38:20.316 --> 04:38:21.918
MANY PEOPLE THAT WERE EXACTLY

04:38:21.985 --> 04:38:23.620
THE ONES THAT THE AUTHOR IS

04:38:23.686 --> 04:38:25.288
TALKING ABOUT AND THAT GROUP

04:38:25.355 --> 04:38:27.690
WAS DIVERSE AND THAT GROUP WAS

04:38:27.757 --> 04:38:30.326
IN NEED. AND SO WITH OUR

04:38:30.393 --> 04:38:32.462
DISADVANTAGING ANYBODY ELSE WE

04:38:32.529 --> 04:38:34.297
COULD FIGURE OUT HOW. TO HAVE

04:38:34.364 --> 04:38:37.333
VETERANS THAT WERE IN VETERANS

04:38:37.400 --> 04:38:39.736
BACK TRAIL CREWS OTHER THINGS

04:38:39.803 --> 04:38:41.938
THAT MET THAT NEED AND IT SEEMS

04:38:42.005 --> 04:38:43.540
TO ME. THAT SOMETHING LIKE

04:38:43.606 --> 04:38:46.543
THAT. WOULD MORE ADDRESSED THE

04:38:46.609 --> 04:38:49.512
ISSUE THAT WE HAVE HERE. AND IT

04:38:49.579 --> 04:38:50.980
YOU KNOW THAT AND I'M

04:38:51.047 --> 04:38:52.449
DISAPPOINTED IN PARTS OF THE

04:38:52.515 --> 04:38:55.618
DEBATE BECAUSE- THE SYSTEM

04:38:55.685 --> 04:38:57.720
NOBODY EVER INTENTIONALLY.

04:38:57.787 --> 04:38:59.489
DISCRIMINATED IT WAS ALL

04:38:59.556 --> 04:39:03.359
UNINTENTIONAL AND YES MANY MANY

04:39:03.426 --> 04:39:05.228
GOVERNMENTS HAVE THIS BUT MANY

04:39:05.295 --> 04:39:07.063
GOVERNMENTS FIGURED OUT A WAY.

04:39:07.130 --> 04:39:08.798
THAT THEY COULD STILL BE FAIR

04:39:08.865 --> 04:39:10.500
TO THE ENTIRE POOL OF

04:39:10.567 --> 04:39:13.436
CANDIDATES. A. N. N. SO IT

04:39:13.503 --> 04:39:15.939
LEAVES THIS VERY DIFFICULT

04:39:16.005 --> 04:39:18.041
SITUATION ON THIS BILL BECAUSE

04:39:18.108 --> 04:39:19.909
I WANT TO HONOR THE AUTHOR FOR

04:39:19.976 --> 04:39:22.345
HIS COMMITMENT WHICH IS WHICH

04:39:22.412 --> 04:39:26.850
IS REALLY IMPRESSIVE AND S. AND

04:39:26.916 --> 04:39:27.684
YET IF THIS BILL. MORE COME

04:39:27.750 --> 04:39:30.453
BACK US IN THE CURRENT FORM I

04:39:30.520 --> 04:39:32.355
COULD NOT VOTE FOR IT BECAUSE

04:39:32.422 --> 04:39:35.925
IT DOES NOT RESOLVE. THE ISSUE

04:39:35.992 --> 04:39:38.695
OF DISH PAIRED IMPACT IN A

04:39:38.761 --> 04:39:41.331
PSYCH I ACTUALLY THINK IT WILL

04:39:41.397 --> 04:39:43.366
BE TAKEN CARE OF IN TWENTY OR

04:39:43.433 --> 04:39:45.068
THIRTY YEARS BECAUSE IF YOU

04:39:45.135 --> 04:39:46.569
LOOK AT WHO'S COMING OUT OF THE

04:39:46.636 --> 04:39:48.771
MILITARY NOW. AND THEY JUST GO

04:39:48.838 --> 04:39:51.674
ONE GENERATION. I THINK IT WILL

04:39:51.741 --> 04:39:53.276
MATCH MUCH MORE THE GENERAL

04:39:53.343 --> 04:39:55.712
POPULATION AND SO THERE HAVE TO

04:39:55.778 --> 04:39:59.182
BE SOME WAYS TO FIGURE OUT HOW

04:39:59.249 --> 04:40:00.717
TO DEAL WITH WHO'S COMING OUT

04:40:00.783 --> 04:40:03.386
OF THE MILITARY NOW. WHO ARE

04:40:03.453 --> 04:40:05.021
VERY DIVERSE. AT THIS BILL

04:40:05.088 --> 04:40:08.091
DOESN'T DO THAT SO I'M TORN

04:40:08.158 --> 04:40:10.827
WHETHER TO NOT VOTE FOR IT. OR

04:40:10.894 --> 04:40:13.196
FIGURE OUT. HOW THE AUTHOR

04:40:13.263 --> 04:40:14.597
pAFTER SOME OF THESE MEETINGS

04:40:14.664 --> 04:40:16.299
DOES IT BUT IF IT'S A

04:40:16.366 --> 04:40:18.301
SUBTERFUGE AMENDMENT OR IT

04:40:18.368 --> 04:40:19.669
STILL COMES BACK WITH TE SAME

04:40:19.736 --> 04:40:21.671
KIND OF THING THAT THE LARGER

04:40:21.738 --> 04:40:23.306
POOL THAT'S NOT THE FIRST. IS

04:40:23.373 --> 04:40:25.742
GIVEN PREFERENCE THAT STILL

04:40:25.808 --> 04:40:28.478
DOESN'T WORK SO A I'M STILL

04:40:28.545 --> 04:40:30.747
TORN RIGHT NOW WHETHER TO VOTE

04:40:30.813 --> 04:40:33.550
NO. OR IF I HAD A SENSE THAT

04:40:33.616 --> 04:40:34.984
THERE WAS A PLACE TO GO AND I

04:40:35.051 --> 04:40:36.219
HAVEN'T HEARD YET THERE'S A

04:40:36.286 --> 04:40:38.087
PLACE TO GO WE VERY CLEARLY

04:40:38.154 --> 04:40:40.256
SAID WHERE THE PROBLEM WAS. BUT

04:40:40.323 --> 04:40:42.792
I HAVEN'T HEARD. A PLACE TO GO

04:40:42.859 --> 04:40:45.728
THAT ADDRESSES THE PROBLEM SO

04:40:45.795 --> 04:40:48.198
THAT'S MY CONCERN AND- I'M NOT

04:40:48.264 --> 04:40:49.165
SURE HOW I'M GONNA VOTE AND

04:40:49.232 --> 04:40:51.134
TELL THE ROLES CALLED BUT IT'S

04:40:51.201 --> 04:40:53.703
OF. IT BUT I WOULDN'T EVEN IF I

04:40:53.770 --> 04:40:55.705
END UP VOTING FOR TO GIVE THE

04:40:55.772 --> 04:40:57.507
AUTHOR CHANCE TO FIX THIS. I'M

04:40:57.574 --> 04:40:59.509
NOT GOING TO VOTE FOR IN ANY

04:40:59.576 --> 04:41:01.611
FUTURE ITERATION UNLESS IT TO

04:41:01.678 --> 04:41:04.514
REST ADDRESSES THE BASIC ISSUE.

04:41:04.581 --> 04:41:07.750

BILL WHERE EVERYONE COMMENTED

04:42:59.696 --> 04:43:05.368
ON. DO WE WANT TO GO FOR NUMBER.

04:43:05.435 --> 04:43:07.236
THREE SENATOR WIENER SUMMER

04:43:07.303 --> 04:43:09.305
ONE. THE FIRST ONE A DEFERRED-

04:43:09.372 --> 04:43:10.039
BUT ONE CARRIAGES ACTUALLY

04:43:10.106 --> 04:43:11.307
FORGOT TO FORGET BECAUSE I

04:43:11.374 --> 04:43:13.543
FORGOT TO MENTION. THAT IN

04:43:13.609 --> 04:43:15.611
TERMS OF THE DISPARATE IMPACTS

04:43:15.678 --> 04:43:17.680
ON SPECIFICALLY ON THE LGBTQ

04:43:17.747 --> 04:43:20.083
COMMUNITY. OUR COMMUNITY IS IN

04:43:20.149 --> 04:43:21.150
A LITTLE BIT OF A UNIQUE

04:43:21.217 --> 04:43:22.452
POSITION WITH THE MILITARY

04:43:22.518 --> 04:43:24.420
BECAUSE WE WERE. COMPLETELY

04:43:24.487 --> 04:43:27.090
BANS UNLIKE OTHER COMMUNITIES

04:43:27.156 --> 04:43:28.524
BUT UNLIKE OTHER UNLIKE MOST

04:43:28.591 --> 04:43:31.260
MOST OTHER PEOPLE- WE WERE

04:43:31.327 --> 04:43:32.662
STILL ABLE TO SERVE BECAUSE

04:43:32.729 --> 04:43:34.864
PEOPLE CHEST. I HID WHO THEY

04:43:34.931 --> 04:43:37.467
WERE. AND THAT WAS THAT WAY

04:43:37.533 --> 04:43:38.334
FOREVER SO THERE ARE ALWAYS

04:43:38.401 --> 04:43:41.170
BEEN. ATTRIBUTED TO PEOPLE.

04:43:41.237 --> 04:43:43.606
ABUNDANTLY IN THE MILITARY WHO

04:43:43.673 --> 04:43:45.742
TRAGICALLY HAD TO SUPPRESS WHO

04:43:45.808 --> 04:43:48.444
THEY WERE AND LIVE IN FEAR- AND

04:43:48.511 --> 04:43:50.380
AT TIMES BE KICKED OUT AND HAVE

04:43:50.446 --> 04:43:52.949
THEIR LIVES UPENDED. UNTIL THE

04:43:53.015 --> 04:43:55.618
WHOLE POLICY WAS REPEALED. BUT

04:43:55.685 --> 04:43:58.087
I. DID SOME LOOKING AND I THINK

04:43:58.154 --> 04:44:00.356
THERE ARE. APPROXIMATELY ONE

04:44:00.423 --> 04:44:04.527
MILLION- LGBTQ VETERANS IN THE

04:44:04.594 --> 04:44:05.061
U. US IT MIGHT BE MORE AND

04:44:05.128 --> 04:44:06.662
THAT'S A LITTLE BIT. BY

04:44:06.729 --> 04:44:09.165
DEFEATED- THAT NUMBER OF US FOR

04:44:09.232 --> 04:44:10.900
A FEW YEARS BACK SO MAYBE.

04:44:10.967 --> 04:44:12.969
HIGHER NOW WITH A MILLION OUT

04:44:13.036 --> 04:44:14.637
OF. I THINK ABOUT EIGHTEEN

04:44:14.704 --> 04:44:17.140
MILLION OR THEREABOUTS VETERANS

04:44:17.206 --> 04:44:19.008
OVERALL SO IT'S ABOUT ALMOST.

04:44:19.075 --> 04:44:21.444
ABOUT A LITTLE MORE THAN FIVE

04:44:21.511 --> 04:44:24.347
PERCENT- AND SO ON I DO THINK

04:44:24.414 --> 04:44:25.982
THERE ARE A LOT OF LGBTQ PEOPLE

04:44:26.048 --> 04:44:28.518
FRANKLY CAN. BENEFIT FROM THAT

04:44:28.584 --> 04:44:31.421
SO IT'S A UNIQUE. SITUATION

04:44:31.487 --> 04:44:33.256
THAT OUR COMMUNITY IS AND I'M-

04:44:33.322 --> 04:44:34.524
I'M NOT DISMISSING THE

04:44:34.590 --> 04:44:36.559
CHALLENGES BECAUSE THE MILITARY

04:44:36.626 --> 04:44:38.060
WAS ABSOLUTELY HORRIFIC.

04:44:38.127 --> 04:44:39.729
TOWARDS OUR COMMUNITY FOR SO

04:44:39.796 --> 04:44:40.396
MANY YEARS BUT I JUST WANTED TO

04:44:40.463 --> 04:44:46.469
PUT THAT. OUT THERE IS A

04:44:46.536 --> 04:44:47.103
CONVERSATION MOVES FORWARD. THE

04:44:47.170 --> 04:44:48.438
YOU. I'D LIKE TO A QUESTION-

04:44:48.504 --> 04:44:49.772
TWO TO THE AUTHOR MY

04:44:49.839 --> 04:44:51.073
UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THIS IS A

04:44:51.140 --> 04:44:55.578
VOLUNTARY. PROGRAM THAT THE-

04:44:55.645 --> 04:44:56.913
THAT'S CORRECT GET YOU YOU'RE

04:44:56.979 --> 04:44:58.815
NOT FOUR STAR VETERANS ARE SO

04:44:58.881 --> 04:45:00.850
THIS THEIR ONES AND MAKE SURE

04:45:00.917 --> 04:45:01.818
THAT'S AN IMPORTANT POINT THAT

04:45:01.884 --> 04:45:04.086
THIS IS NOT PUBLIC POLICY

04:45:04.153 --> 04:45:05.788
THROUGH A MANDATE BUT SOMETHING

04:45:05.855 --> 04:45:07.824
THAT IS VOLUNTARY SO I THINK

04:45:07.890 --> 04:45:09.625
THE SOCIETAL IMPACTS EVEN THOSE

04:45:09.692 --> 04:45:11.461
ADDICTS HAVE EXPRESSED

04:45:11.527 --> 04:45:13.996
MERITORIOUS CONCERNS WILL BE

04:45:14.063 --> 04:45:16.866
MITIGATED TO SOME DEGREE. BONTA

04:45:16.933 --> 04:45:20.703
MY SECOND POINT IS. I THINK

04:45:20.770 --> 04:45:23.072
FIVE ONE OF THE APPRECIATIONS

04:45:23.139 --> 04:45:25.808
THAT. OUR COMMUNITY HAS SHOWN

04:45:25.875 --> 04:45:27.944
TO THOSE WHO HAVE. SACRIFICED

04:45:28.010 --> 04:45:30.379
THEIR MILITARY SERVICE. IS

04:45:30.446 --> 04:45:32.348
FINDING WAYS TO RE INTEGRATE

04:45:32.415 --> 04:45:36.085
THOSE PERSON THOSE FOLKS. INTO

04:45:36.152 --> 04:45:39.121
CIVILIAN LIFE AGAIN. I DON'T

04:45:39.188 --> 04:45:40.690
WANT TO OVERLOOK THE FACT THAT.

04:45:40.756 --> 04:45:42.024
THE BENEFITS THAT WE HAVE

04:45:42.091 --> 04:45:43.860
DERIVED AS A COMMUNITY AS A

04:45:43.926 --> 04:45:45.862
STATE AND AS A COUNTRY BECAUSE

04:45:45.928 --> 04:45:47.897
OF THE SERVICE THAT INDIVIDUALS

04:45:47.964 --> 04:45:49.899
HAVE PROVIDED THROUGH THE ARM

04:45:49.966 --> 04:45:51.901
SERVICES IN THE ARMED FORCES.

04:45:51.968 --> 04:45:54.036
AND I ALSO LOOK AT THIS AS IF

04:45:54.103 --> 04:45:56.439
THIS IS HELPFUL TO THOSE

04:45:56.506 --> 04:45:58.608

TESTS CONDUCTED IN CALIFORNIA.

05:06:02.711 --> 05:06:03.845
THE BILL DOES NOT PROHIBIT

05:06:03.912 --> 05:06:06.214
TOXICITY TESTING THAT'S

05:06:06.281 --> 05:06:08.149
REQUIRED BY FEDERAL LAW AND

05:06:08.216 --> 05:06:10.752
DOES NOT IMPACTS ON A TESTING

DISCOVERED CHEMICALS MIGHT HAVE

ON HUMANS- SOME TESTS INVOLVE

05:06:33.908 --> 05:06:35.810
OVERDOSING DOGS. AND

05:06:35.877 --> 05:06:37.512
ADMINISTERING CHEMICALS OVER A

05:06:37.579 --> 05:06:40.215
PROLONGED PERIOD CAUSING SLOW

05:06:40.281 --> 05:06:42.383
AND HORRIFIC PAIN. ANIMALS ARE

05:06:42.450 --> 05:06:44.619
OBSERVED FOR TOXIC SIDE EFFECTS

05:06:44.686 --> 05:06:45.787
RANGING FROM VOMITING AND

DEATH. BY DOGS AND CATS SUFFER

05:06:51.292 --> 05:06:52.460
GREATLY FROM THIS TOXICITY

05:06:52.527 --> 05:06:55.163
TESTING WHICH WE ALSO NOW KNOW

05:06:55.230 --> 05:06:57.132
IT'S LARGELY INEFFECTIVE AND

05:06:57.198 --> 05:06:58.867
NOT SUPPORTIVE BY CURRENT

05:06:58.933 --> 05:07:01.102
SCIENCE. A GROWING BODY OF

05:07:01.169 --> 05:07:03.004
RESEARCH SHOWS THAT DOG STUDIES

05:07:03.071 --> 05:07:04.873
PRODUCE HIGH LEVELS OF FALSE

05:07:04.939 --> 05:07:06.775
NEGATIVES. WHICH OCCUR WHEN A

05:07:06.841 --> 05:07:08.610
PRODUCT APPEARS TO BE SAFE AND

05:07:08.676 --> 05:07:12.113
DOGS BUT IS FOUND TO BE HARMFUL

05:07:12.180 --> 05:07:13.014
IN HUMANS. DRUG DEVELOPMENT

05:07:13.081 --> 05:07:15.183
RESEARCH SHOWS THAT 90% OF

05:07:15.250 --> 05:07:17.519
DRUGS FIRST TESTED ON ANIMALS

05:07:17.585 --> 05:07:19.254
FAIL WHEN SUBSEQUENTLY TESTED

05:07:19.320 --> 05:07:21.356
IN PEOPLE. RESEARCHERS HAVE

05:07:21.422 --> 05:07:22.657
EVEN EQUATED PREDICTIONS OF

05:07:22.724 --> 05:07:25.527
TOXICITY BASED ON CANINE DATA.

05:07:25.593 --> 05:07:27.395
TO SLIGHTLY BETTER THAN TOSSING

05:07:27.462 --> 05:07:30.098
A COIN. TOXICITY TESTS DO NOT

05:07:30.165 --> 05:07:31.499
ENSURE HUMAN SAFETY AND

05:07:31.566 --> 05:07:34.302

SERVES NO REGULATORY

05:07:44.445 --> 05:07:46.548
REQUIREMENTS. COMPANIES CONDUCT

05:07:46.614 --> 05:07:48.616
THIS TYPE OF TESTING NOT

05:07:48.683 --> 05:07:50.418
BECAUSE THEY'RE REQUIRED TO USE

05:07:50.485 --> 05:07:52.754
DOGS OR CATS BUT BECAUSE- THERE

05:07:52.821 --> 05:07:54.756
IS PRECEDENT AND CONVENIENCE

05:07:54.823 --> 05:07:56.891
WHICH FRANKLY DOES NOT JUSTIFY

05:07:56.958 --> 05:07:59.027
THE SUFFERING ENDURED BY THESE

05:07:59.093 --> 05:08:01.329
ANIMALS. AS TESTING IS

05:08:01.396 --> 05:08:02.997
CONDUCTED BEHIND CLOSED DOORS

05:08:03.064 --> 05:08:04.866
AND PRIVATE LIVES. AND THEY'RE

05:08:04.933 --> 05:08:06.734
NOT REQUIRED TO REPORT WHAT

05:08:06.801 --> 05:08:09.137
TESTS ARE CONDUCTING AND WHY.

05:08:09.204 --> 05:08:10.171
FOR INSTANCE DURING THE ONE

05:08:10.238 --> 05:08:13.208

CONSUME PESTICIDE EVERY DAY FOR

05:08:17.412 --> 05:08:19.781
AN ENTIRE YEAR. ALL THE DOGS

05:08:19.848 --> 05:08:21.115
ARE KILLED AT THE END OF THE

05:08:21.182 --> 05:08:22.817
STUDY IF THEY DO NOT DIE DURING

05:08:22.884 --> 05:08:25.520
THE STUDY. THE EPA ELIMINATED

05:08:25.587 --> 05:08:26.788
THIS TEST REQUIREMENT MORE THAN

05:08:26.855 --> 05:08:28.990
A DECADE AGO YOUR COMPANY STILL

SUBMIT THE DATA AS PART OF

05:08:34.896 --> 05:08:36.831
THEIR PESTICIDE REGISTRATION.

05:08:36.898 --> 05:08:38.366
CALIFORNIA HAS BEEN A LEADER IN

05:08:38.433 --> 05:08:40.168
ALTERNATIVE TESTING METHODS

05:08:40.235 --> 05:08:41.703
WHICH REPLACE ANIMAL TESTING

05:08:41.769 --> 05:08:44.005
WITH NEW INNOVATIVE TECHNOLOGY

05:08:44.072 --> 05:08:45.640
EXAMPLES INCLUDE USING LAB

05:08:45.707 --> 05:08:47.141
GROWN HUMAN TISSUE INSTEAD OF

05:08:47.208 --> 05:08:49.244
LIVE ANIMALS AND USING COMPUTER

05:08:49.310 --> 05:08:51.246
MODELING TO PREDICT THE IMPACT

05:08:51.312 --> 05:08:52.947
OF A HARMFUL CHEMICAL. THEY'RE

05:08:53.014 --> 05:08:54.315
ALREADY EFFORTS TO MAKE THE

05:08:54.382 --> 05:08:55.717
TRANSITION TO ALTERNATIVE

05:08:55.783 --> 05:08:57.952
TESTING ON A NATIONAL LEVEL THE

05:08:58.019 --> 05:08:59.888
EPA HAS COMMITTED TO ELIMINATE

05:08:59.954 --> 05:09:01.656
ALL ANIMAL TESTING FOR

05:09:01.723 --> 05:09:03.424
PESTICIDES AND CHEMICALS BY

05:09:03.491 --> 05:09:05.693
TWENTY THIRTY FIVE. THE FDA HAS

05:09:05.760 --> 05:09:06.628
ALSO EMBRACED ALTERNATIVE

05:09:06.694 --> 05:09:09.197
TESTING BY RELEASING A-

PREDICTIVE TOXICOLOGY ROADMAP

05:09:11.266 --> 05:09:12.967
AND FORMING AN ALTERNATIVE

05:09:13.034 --> 05:09:14.569
METHODS WORKING GROUP- WE'RE

LANGUAGE IN THE BILL IS

05:09:22.644 --> 05:09:24.712
PERFECTLY CLEAR THAT IF THE FDA

05:09:24.779 --> 05:09:28.383
REQUIRES- DOG CAUGHT TESTING

05:09:28.449 --> 05:09:30.151
FOR DRUG APPROVAL BY THE WE'RE

05:09:30.218 --> 05:09:32.287
NOT TRYING TO BAN NOT IF IT IS

05:09:32.353 --> 05:09:34.622
REQUIRED BY THE FDA- AND SO

05:09:34.689 --> 05:09:35.990
WE'RE GOING TO WORK TO REFINE

05:09:36.057 --> 05:09:40.361
THE LANGUAGE. AND MAKE SURE

05:09:40.428 --> 05:09:41.663
THAT IT IS CLEAR THIS IS A

05:09:41.729 --> 05:09:44.032

05:17:57.925 --> 05:17:59.126
CONSEQUENCE THAT IT WILL NOT

05:17:59.193 --> 05:18:00.494
ALLOW ANY TESTING ON CATS AND

05:18:00.561 --> 05:18:02.296
DOGS TO BRING A DRUG T MARKET

05:18:02.363 --> 05:18:03.664
THIS IS A CRITICAL PROBLEM IS

05:18:03.731 --> 05:18:04.832
ONE OF THE GOALS OF BIOMEDICAL

05:18:04.899 --> 05:18:06.634
RESEARCH IS TO TRANSLATE THE

05:18:06.700 --> 05:18:07.735
DISCOVERIES OF THE LABORATORY

05:18:07.802 --> 05:18:09.503

05:18:12.239 --> 05:18:13.874
CELEBREX TO BRING ABOUT AND

05:18:13.941 --> 05:18:18.712
MAKE THE NEXT THESE ARE. ALL

05:18:18.779 --> 05:18:19.346
DRUGS THAT WERE TESTED ON DOT.

05:18:19.413 --> 05:18:20.381
ECLINICALWORKS ANIMAL. IN THE

05:18:20.448 --> 05:18:21.949
U. STEP BEFORE CLOSE MAKERS

05:18:22.016 --> 05:18:23.918
TEST HUMANS. ANIMALS ARE NOT

05:18:23.984 --> 05:18:24.718
ONLY NEEDED TO TEST THE

05:18:24.785 --> 05:18:25.686
EFFECTIVENESS OF THE

05:18:25.753 --> 05:18:27.421
MEDICATIONS. THEY ALSO NEEDED

05:18:27.488 --> 05:18:28.956
TO CHECK THE SAFETY OF PRODUCTS

05:18:29.023 --> 05:18:30.691
THE PREVENT ANY POTENTIAL HARM.

05:18:30.758 --> 05:18:32.293
HUMANS ARE NOT THE ONLY ONES TO

05:18:32.359 --> 05:18:33.727
BENEFIT FROM THIS RESEARCH AND

05:18:33.794 --> 05:18:35.563
TESTING HUNDREDS OF DRUGS AND

05:18:35.629 --> 05:18:36.831
TREATMENTS DEVELOPING NEW

05:18:36.897 --> 05:18:37.965
MENUS. ARE NOW WITH TEAM

05:18:38.032 --> 05:18:39.533
LEADERS AND THAT NAY CLINICS AS

WELL HELPING ANIMALS LIVE

05:18:41.235 --> 05:18:43.304
LONGER HEALTHIER LIVES. AS I

05:18:43.370 --> 05:18:45.139
MENTIONED LEGALLY IN ORDER FOR

05:18:45.206 --> 05:18:46.707
THE FDA TO ALLOW DRUG MAKERS

05:18:46.774 --> 05:18:48.909
BEGIN TRIAL NEWMAN. IT REQUIRES

05:18:48.976 --> 05:18:50.511
FIRST TESTING WITH THE ROAD.

05:18:50.578 --> 05:18:52.279
AND THEN A NON ROAD TO SPECIES.

05:18:52.346 --> 05:18:54.415
BASIC SPECIALIST ON THE

05:18:54.482 --> 05:18:55.015
NONVOTING SPECIES ARE

05:18:55.082 --> 05:18:56.884
CONFIDENTIAL BUT THEY ARE IN

05:18:56.951 --> 05:18:57.751
THE INFANCY OF THE PATENT

05:18:57.818 --> 05:18:59.987
PROCESS. AS SUCH THERE'S NO WAY

05:19:00.054 --> 05:19:01.288
FOR A MANUFACTURED TO SHOW WHAT

05:19:01.355 --> 05:19:03.190
THE FDA HAS RECOMMENDED. MANY

05:19:03.257 --> 05:19:04.425
OF THESE NON RODENT SPECIES

05:19:04.492 --> 05:19:06.327
MUST BE A DOG OR CAT AS THE

05:19:06.393 --> 05:19:07.428
OTHER SIDE TYPICALLY BEST

05:19:07.495 --> 05:19:09.230
SUITED MODEL. WHILE I'M

05:19:09.296 --> 05:19:10.531
SPEAKING ABOUT RESEARCH WITH

CATS AN DOGS TODAY IT IS

05:19:11.866 --> 05:19:13.934
IMPORTANT TO STRESS THAT 95% OF

05:19:14.001 --> 05:19:15.469
ALL RESEARCH. CONDUCTED WITH

05:19:15.536 --> 05:19:16.704
ANIMALS IN THE NINE STATES OF

RODENTS RATS AND MICE. DOGS AND

05:19:19.039 --> 05:19:20.341
CATS TOGETHER ACCOUNT FOR LESS

05:19:20.407 --> 05:19:26.647
THAN. 1% OF ALL THE SEARCH

05:19:26.714 --> 05:19:27.915

WOULD NEVER TO PAY THAT HAD NOT

05:19:32.520 --> 05:19:33.687

RESEARCH IT ONLY IMPACTS LESS

05:20:46.961 --> 05:20:48.796
THAN 1% OF ALL ANIMALS USED IN

VERY. COMPLEX ISSUE AT LEAST A

05:23:11.271 --> 05:23:13.774
COMPLEX ISSUE FOR ME- THE ISSUE

05:23:13.841 --> 05:23:16.076
IS TO IS TO WHAT'S REQUIRED

05:23:16.143 --> 05:23:18.112
WHAT'S RECOMMENDED- WHERE WE

05:23:18.178 --> 05:23:20.080
DRAW THE LINE. I DON'T THINK

05:23:20.147 --> 05:23:21.281
THERE'S ANYBODY IN THIS CHAMBER

05:23:21.348 --> 05:23:25.252
WHO WISHES TO SEE A DOG OR CAT-

05:23:25.319 --> 05:23:28.322
SUFFER UNNECESSARILY CERTAINLY-

05:23:28.388 --> 05:23:29.523
AND MOST OF US DON'T WANT TO

05:23:29.590 --> 05:23:30.390
SEE HUMANS SUFFER.

05:23:30.457 --> 05:23:32.159
UNNECESSARILY AND SO WE'RE WE

DRAW A LINE THAT'S A THAT'S A

05:23:33.594 --> 05:23:35.529
CHALLENGE FOR US. AND IT'S

05:23:35.596 --> 05:23:36.430
PARTICULARLY CHALLENGING IF IT

05:23:36.497 --> 05:23:38.098
WAS REQUIRES YOU KNOW FOR

DRUG FOR EXAMPLE THERE'S A

05:23:43.537 --> 05:23:44.805
PANDEMIC AND I UNDERSTAND THAT

05:23:44.872 --> 05:23:46.940
THAT THAT DOG TESTING OR CAT

05:23:47.007 --> 05:23:48.642
TESTING WAS A PART OF THE

05:23:48.709 --> 05:23:49.610
DEVELOPMENT OF THE VACCINE FOR

05:23:49.676 --> 05:23:51.879
COVERT- I'M GONNA SUPPORT THE

05:23:51.945 --> 05:23:54.548

DEVELOPMENT OF DRUGS- WE DON'T

05:24:06.693 --> 05:24:07.961
AGAIN WANT TO SEE UNNECESSARY

05:24:08.028 --> 05:24:10.030
TESTING UNNECESSARY HARM TO

05:24:10.097 --> 05:24:11.899
ANIMALS. BUT WE DO WANT TO SEE

05:24:11.965 --> 05:24:13.634
