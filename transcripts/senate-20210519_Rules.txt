YEAH I AM ASSEMBLY A CLEVER WAY TO AND I DO WANT TO SHARE THAT JOINING ME VIRTUALLY AND BURY HIS FRIENDS I IS MY HUSBAND AS WELL AS MY MOTHER AND OTHER MEMBERS OF MY FAMILY EVEN THOUGH THEY'RE NOT HERE ON CAMERA WITH ME BUT I DO WANT TO SHARE WITH YOU WHAT ON A PRIVILEGE IT IS TO BE ABLE FOR ALL OF YOU THIS AFTERNOON. AS A DAUGHTER OF A PROUD MEMBER OF THE UNITED STATES MARINE CORPS AT A HIGH SCHOOL ENGLISH TEACHER I REFLECT UPON MY LIFE AND IS A PRODUCT OF OUR CALIFORNIA PUBLIC SCHOOL SYSTEM. AND I HAD IN MY REFLECTION I REALLY REFLECT ON WATCHING MY MOTHER I TEACHER WHO WAS TEACHING HIGH SCHOOL ENGLISH ALSO AN ADVISER FOR VARIOUS EXTRACURRICULAR ACTIVITIES AND HOW SHE WOULD AFTER A DAY OF WORK COME HOME GRADE PAPERS AND EXAMS ARE THAT OUR STUDENTS HAVE COMPLETED ALL WHILE TAKING CARE OF HER FAMILY. SHUTTLING US BACK AND FORTH TO ACTIVITIES AS WELL AS COOKING DINNER AND I HAVE TO TELL YOU WHEN WATCHING HER DO THAT DAY IN AND DAY OUT I CAME TO THE CONCLUSION THAT I DEFINITELY DID NOT WANT TO BE A TEACHER AND DID NOT WANT TOGO INTO THE FIELD OF EDUCATION. IT WAS JUST ARE AMAZING TO ME TO GOING TO A PROFESSION THAT REQUIRES SO MUCH INSIDE AND OUTSIDE OF WORK AND THAT ALSO HAD HEARING DEGREES OF RESPECT FROM MEMBERS OF THE SOCIETY SO I DECIDED I WAS GOING INTO COMPUTER SCIENCE BECAUSE THAT. WAS THE WAY OF THE FUTURE. THERE THAT TIME. WHILE I WAS- PURSUING MY TO. I JUST TO WORK AS AN- SAYS- ANY HIGH IN LONG BEACH. AND I HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO WORK WITH STUDENTS THAT WERE IN ENGLISH AS A SECOND LANGUAGE CLASSES. AS WELL AS SEVENTH IN IN EIGHTH GRADERS WHO WERE REALLY TRYING TO ACQUIRE LITERACY SKILLS THAT ALIGN TO THE GRACE THAT THEY WORK IN. AND IT WAS AT THAT TIME. THAT I UNDERSTOOD WHY MY MOTHER IN TENS OF THOUSANDS OF OTHER TEACHERS DID THE WORK THAT THEY DID. I HAVE TO TELL YOU TO WATCH STUDENTS GROW IN LEARN STILL LEAVES ME WITHOUT WORDS. EVEN AFTER OVER THIRTY YEARS. IN THIS PARTICULAR PROFESSION. SO I DECIDED I WAS GOING TO GO AHEAD AND I WAS GOING TO BE A TEACHER. AND OVER THIRTY YEARS FROM THAT DECISION HERE I AM BEFORE YOU TODAY. I HAVE HAD THE PRIVILEGE TO SERVE STUDENTS IN MANY DIFFERENT ROLES AS A TEACHER A SCHOOL PRINCIPAL AND DISTRICT ADMINISTRATOR AND ALSO COUNTY OFFICE ADMINISTRATOR. IN EACH POSITION THAT I'VE HELD AT NOW IS AN APPOINTEE TO THE CALIFORNIA STATE BOARD OF EDUCATION. MY MISSION IS AND ALWAYS HAS BEEN TO ENSURE THAT EVERY STUDENT THAT ENTERS OUR SCHOOLS AS THE GUIDANCE AND SUPPORT THAT THEY NEED. TO ACHIEVE WHATEVER IT IS THAT THEY DESIRE WHEN THEY GRADUATE FROM OUR HIGH SCHOOLS. AS A MOTHER AND AS A WIFE OF A RETIRED LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICER I KNOW FIRST HAND HOW DAILY EXPERIENCES IN SCHOOL CAN IMPACT FAMILY LIFE. AND I TRULY BELIEVE THAT ALL PARENTS AND GUARDIANS WANT WHAT'S BEST FOR THEIR CHILDREN EVEN IF THEY MAY NOT KNOW EXACTLY HOW TO GO ABOUT. MAKING SURE THAT HAPPENS. ONE THING I DO KNOW IS THAT THE STUDENTS IN OUR GREAT STATE ARE VERY DIVERSE GROUP. SOMEONE HOUSEHOLDS THAT ARE ECONOMICALLY WEALTHY AND SOME DO NOT. SOME WOMEN IN ENVIRONMENTS THAT ARE FUNDING AND LACKING AND SOME DO NOT SOME OF THE LAST SCHOOL AND WANT TO COME TO SCHOOL EVERY DAY AND WOULD COME ON THE WEEKENDS IF THEY COULD. AND SOME DO NOT. SO ARE WORKING PUBLIC EDUCATION IS MORE THAN JUST PROVIDING STUDENTS WITH AN OPPORTUNITY TO SUCCEED. IT'S ABOUT ENSURING THAT ALL STUDENTS HAVE THE SCAFFOLDS IN THE SUPPORT THEY NEED IN ORDER TO SEIZE THOSE OPPORTUNITIES. SO MY COMMITMENTS TO CALIFORNIA TO THE STUDENTS FAMILIES AND- EDUCATORS IS TO WORK HARD AND DILIGENTLY TO BE SURE THAT OUR PRACTICES IN OUR POLICIES AND PUBLIC EDUCATION HELP TO BUILD SCALPELS. AND NOT TEAR THEM DOWN OR EVEN WORSE CREATE BARRIERS TO REACHING THEM. SO I THANK YOU AGAIN FOR INVITING ME TO BE BEFORE YOU TODAY I LOOK FORWARD TO MY TIME WITH YOU THIS AFTERNOON TO RESPOND TO ANY QUESTIONS YOU MIGHT HAVE.

I'VE BEEN A CLASSROOM TEACHER FOR TWENTY THREE YEARS I'M CURRENTLY IN THE CLASSROOM. AT CENTRAL UNION HIGH SCHOOL IN EL CENTRO CALIFORNIA. UP TO FIFTEEN MINUTES FROM THE MEXICAN BORDER- AND I HAVE BEEN A CLASSROOM TEACHER FOR TWENTY THREE YEARS AND A NATIONAL BOARD CERTIFIED TEACHER FOR SIXTEEN OF THOSE YEARS. MY BACKGROUND IN EDUCATION IS INCREDIBLY DIVERSE I'VE TAUGHT AT DIFFERENT LEVELS DIFFERENT SUBJECTS- AND BUT I ALWAYS SAY THAT. THE MOST IMPORTANT- THING THAT I TEACHERS STUDENTS ARE BRIGHT REGARDLESS OF THE SUBJECT I'VE SERVED ON VARIOUS COMMISSIONS AND BOARDS. ALWAYS WITH THE AIM OF SUPPORTING OUR STUDENTS AND WORKING TO CREATE EQUITABLE LEARNING ENVIRONMENTS I HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO REPRESENT THE DEPARTMENT OF STATE AND PURCELL. AS AN INTERNATIONAL LEADER IN EDUCATION R. AS AN AMBASSADOR IN EDUCATION AND IN TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN GOVERNOR BROWN APPOINTED ME TO SERVE ON THE COMMISSION ON TEACHER CREDENTIALING. SERMON ON THE STATE BOARD OF EDUCATION ARE FEELS LIKE A NATURAL PROGRESSION AFTER HAVING SERVED FOR SIX YEARS ON THE CTC. WHERE I CHAIRED THE EDUCATOR PREPARATION COMMITTEE AND SERVES AS LIAISON TO THE COMMITTEE ON ACCREDITATION. DURING MY TENURE WITH THE CTC REMAKE GREAT STRIDES WE UPDATED THE ACCREDITATION SYSTEM- UPDATED TEACHING STANDARDS AND VERY OLD ALL WITH THE GOAL OF CREATING MORE REFLECTIVE PRACTITIONERS.

IF YOU'RE PREPARED TO ASK COMMENTS AND I WILL LET YOU DIRECT YOUR QUESTIONS TO INDIVIDUALS ARE TO EACH ARE AND LET YOU TAKE IT FROM THERE OKAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH MADAM CHAIR AND- LET ME THANK ALL THREE. ARE OF PEOPLE IN FRONT OF US TODAY FOR A MEETING WITH ME YESTERDAY I THOUGHT OF WAS A VERY GOOD MEETING AND WE TALKED ABOUT. ON MANY THINGS AND MOTIVATIONS AND HOW OF AL JUST BOARD FITS ARE IT IN THE EDUCATION GOVERNMENTS AND I DON'T FEEL THE NEED TO GO OVER THAT AND EACH OF YOU I ASKED EACH OF YOU WHAT MOTIVATED YOU A. N. I THOUGHT I WOULD SORT OF FOLLOW UP WATER JUST ASKING FOR PEOPLE TO EXPAND ON THAT FOR EXAMPLE- MISTER MCCLELLAN. TALKED ABOUT THE FACT THAT THE TRIBAL ACHIEVEMENT GAP WAS IN EDUCATION WAS HIS PERSONAL MOTIVATION AND THAT IT REALLY DROVE HIM AND I WAS WONDERING- MISTER MCCLELLAN IF YOU COULD EXPAND ON THAT. THANK YOU SENATOR. I CAN'T REMEMBER WHAT I SAID BUT- WHAT NO NO YOU JUST HAVE TO BE CONSISTENT WITH WHAT YOU. RIGHT WELL THERE ARE SEVERAL THINGS THAT MOTIVATE ME TO BE IN THIS POSITION ARE TO BE HONORED IN THIS POSITION LIKE MANY OF US- I WANT TO SERVE BETTER MY COMMUNITY FOR SURE- YOU KNOW I'M AMERICAN INDIAN FROM THE FAR NORTH HERE THE YUROK TRIBE. ON MY MOTHER'S SIDE THERE CONTINUES TO BE AN ACHIEVEMENT GAP WITH THEM THIS POPULATION THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IN TERMS OF GRADUATION RATES OR TEST SCORES AND IN OTHER AREAS MOVING ON TO HIGHER EDUCATION. I WOULD LIKE TO SEE- OUR PROGRAMS OUR EFFORTS TOGETHER. MAKE A DIFFERENCE IN REDUCING THIS ACHIEVEMENT GAP YOU KNOW AND THAT MOTIVATES ME AND IS ALWAYS MOTIVATED ME TO IMPROVE MY COMMUNITY. AND HELP MY FAMILY. HELP THE NEXT GENERATION TO BE MORE SUCCESSFUL I WAS A FIRST GENERATION COLLEGE STUDENT IN MY FAMILY THE FIRST. TO GO THAT WAY WAS A VERY LONELY EXPERIENCE AND NOBODY CAME TO MY GRADUATION AT SACRAMENTO STATE AND I. I STILL HAVE PAIN OVER THAT YOU KNOW IT WAS IT WAS NEW AND DIFFERENT YOU KNOW- BUT NOW I AM HAPPY TO SAY SOME OF MY YOUNGER SIBLINGS HAVE NOW GRADUATED COLLEGE. OF AN NIECE THAT JUST FINISHED UP THE WHOLE STATE ON FRIDAY I GOT TO BE A PART OF CELEBRATING HER OF OTHER NIECES HAVE WHO HAVE COMPLETED. AND IT'S A NEW IT'S A NEW TIME AND- I WOULD LIKE TO SEE US- MAKE OUR CLASSROOMS MORE ACCOMMODATING AND- ACCEPTING- FOR AMERICAN INDIAN STUDENTS- THEY NEED TO SEE. THEMSELVES IN THE CURRICULUM THEY NEED TO SEE THEMSELVES OF ROLE MODELS IN THE STAFF AND TEACHING WE HAVE A SHORTAGE OF TEACHERS ALL THROUGHOUT. THE SPECIALLY AMERICAN INDIAN TEACHERS. I WOULD LIKE TO. MAKE A DIFFERENCE SO. WHEN WE SEE THOSE OPPORTUNITIES COMING WHETHER THEY BE BILLS OR A LEGISLATION COMING THAT MAY. MAKE OUR CLASSROOMS MORE INCLUSIVE. AND HELP IN THOSE WAYS I HOPE WE CAN ALL WORK TOGETHER. TO CLOSE THE ACHIEVEMENT GAP THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH APPRECIATE YOUR COMMENTS AND THINK THAT. ONE OF THE IMPORTANT THINGS ABOUT A BOARD LIKE THIS IS PEOPLE BRING THEIR OWN EXPERIENCE INTO THE BROADER RANGE IN A WAY THAT. WE CAN MAKE SURE TAT THAT OUR EDUCATION SYSTEM INCLUDED IN REFLECTS IT SO I PER SHARE COMMENTS. WELL LET ME ASK MS RODRIGUEZ- WHEN I ASKED YOU THE A SIMILAR QUESTION. ARM YOU MENTIONED THAT YOU STARTED OUT AS A LITERACY VOLUNTEER IN THERE FOR THE STATE LITERACY PLAN AND WHAT IT LED TO IN THE EDUCATION SYSTEM MEANT A LOT TO YOU I WONDER IF YOU COULD TALK A LITTLE ABOUT THAT. ABSOLUTELY OUR- THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR THAT QUESTION SO WHEN IT WHEN I STARTED AS A LITERACY VOLUNTEER I WAS ACTUALLY ON MY WAY TO LAW SCHOOL. OUR I WAS I WAS MORE INTERESTED IN WORKING AS A VOLUNTEER TO TEACH READING BECAUSE READING THE SOMETHING THAT HAS ALWAYS BEEN- VERY IMPORTANT TO ME AND I KNOW THAT IT'S ESSENTIAL FOR YOUNG PEOPLE TO HAVE NOT ONLY ACCESS TO TAXED BUT TO BE ABLE TO DECONSTRUCT AND TO BE ABLE TO UNDERSTAND THAT AND AS I MENTIONED YESTERDAY- IT'S ONLY BY. BY READING AND UNDERSTANDING THAT WE HAVE ACCESS TO OUR DEMOCRATIC PROCESS AND SO I REALLY EMPHASIZE THIS IN MY IN MY CLASSES TODAY AND I BELIEVE THAT OUR BUILDING LITERACY FROM A YOUNG AGE BUILDING UNDERSTANDING. IS OUR ONE OF THE IT BUT THE MOST FUNDAMENTAL SKILL THAT OUR STUDENTS CAN DEVELOP AND THAT WE CAN BUILD ON THAT SO A FEW MONTHS AGO- WHEN WE APPROVED THE STATE LITERACY PLAN- I WAS VER EXCITED- YOU KNOW NOW THERE ARE THERE OPPORTUNITIES FOR SCHOOL DISTRICTS ALLEY AIMS TO. I'VE COME UP WITH OUR- BRANDS- THAT'LL THAT'LL COME THROUGH US AND YOU WILL BE ABLE TO IMPROVE. THEIR LITERACY SKILLS IN THE READING SKILLS OF OUR STUDENTS IN CALIFORNIA. THANK YOU- PROJECT THAT ANSWER VERY MUCH AND WHAT IT MEANS ALSO TO WHAT YOU BRING. BOB TO THE BOARD AND THEN LET ME ASK OF MS GLOVER WOODS. ARM YOU KNOW AND MAYBE THE OTHERS WANT TO COMMENT ON THIS I ASKED ALL THREE OF YOU. ARE YOUR PERSPECTIVE ON THE FACT THAT YOU MIGHT HAVE YOUR PERSONAL INTEREST IN SOME WAY OR YOUR PERSONAL BACKGROUND. AND YOU MIGHT BE CALL IT IN YOUR CASE ARE WORKING WITH A LOCAL- EDUCATION AGENCY. AND YOU MIGHT BE CHALLENGED IN A WAY. THAT YOU FEEL LIKE YOU HAVE TO VOTE AGAINST THE OUR INTEREST OF THAT AGENCY IN SOMETHING YOU DO ON THE STATE BOARD AND YOU. YOU TALKED ABOUT REPRESENTING THE PERSPECTIVE OF ALL THE STUDENTS ANDTHAT THAT MIGHT. YOU KNOW NAVIGATE YOU IN THAT CONFLICT I WONDERED IF YOU COULD. EXPAND ON THAT A LITTLE. YES I CAN'T I AS I WAS SHARING WITH YOU ON YESTERDAY ONE THING I DO REALIZE THAT AS A MEMBER OF THE STATE BOARD OF EDUCATION. WE HAVE A- A MORAL OBLIGATION TO REPRESENT TO MAKE DECISIONS FOR ALL STUDENTS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND WHILE I BELIEVE THAT ANY DECISION THAT COMES BEFORE THE BOARD AND IT DECISION THAT NEEDS TO BE MADE IS NOT SOMETHING THAT I WOULD APPROVE IT WAS DETRIMENTAL TO STUDENTS. THERE MIGHT BE SOMETHING THAT PERHAPS MAY NOT NECESSARILY. BE ORDER ONLINE IN OUR LOCAL AREA BUT MIGHT BE BEST FOR THE GROUP BOTH OUR DIVERSE GROUPS OF STUDENTS IN CALIFORNIA AS A WHOLE- AS A SHARED WITH YOU ON OUR CONVERSATION YESTERDAY I HAVE NOT HAD THAT. COME FORWARD AS OF YET- I DO BELIEVE IN RIVERSIDE COUNTY AND WE HAVE OUR FINGER ON THE PULSE OF REALLY HOW TO ENSURE THAT ALL STUDENTS HAVE EQUITABLE LEARNING ENVIRONMENTS AND- WANT TO BE SURE THAT WE HAVE POLICIES AND PRACTICES THAT SUPPORT THAT. BUT I DO REALIZE THAT- BEING IN THIS PARTICULAR C. AS ONE OF GREAT RESPONSIBILITY AND ONE THAT REQUIRES REPRESENTATION FOR NOT JUST MY LOCAL AREA BUT FOR OUR STATE AS A WHOLE. THANK YOU I REALLY APPRECIATE YOUR RESPONSE AND MADAM CHAIR. BOB PRITCHARD ALL THREE RESPONSES I CONSUMERS FEEL GOOD ABOUT ALL THREE CANDIDATES THANK YOU. CENTER CLERT THANK YOU SO MUCH I'M GOING TO TURN TO A MADAM VICE CHAIR NOW FOR HER COMMENTS AND QUESTIONS. THANK YOU AND- THANK YOU FOR STEPPING UP FOR WHAT I BELIEVE IS ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT ASSIGNMENTS. AS A VOLUNTEER AND WE KNOW THAT THIS IS TRULY A VOLUNTEER JOB AT THAT TIME- ONLY BRINGS THE MOST PASSIONATE. OF FOLKS FORWARD- TO PUT THEIR NAME IN THE HOPPER AND HOPEFULLY GETTING APPOINTED TO SOMETHING BECAUSE YOU'RE IN CHARGE OF OUR FUTURE GENERATIONS. AND HEARING OFF FROM YOU AND I GOOD JOB AND COLLEAGUES TO MY RIGHT HERE- AND WHAT MOTIVATED YOU ALL I DID HAVE A CHANCE TO MEET WITH YOU AND I APOLOGIZE FOR THAT BUT YESTERDAY WAS A VERY LONG MEETING ON THE PANDEMIC COMMITTEE. I AND WE HAD SOME REALLY INTERESTING COMMENTS ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED TO OUR CHILDREN. ARE DURING THE PANDEMIC YESTERDAY AT REALLY FOCUSED ON THE RESTAURANT INDUSTRY BUT PREVIOUSLY LOOKING OUT OF THE ON THE IMPACTS THAT WE'VE HAD TO EDUCATION HAS BEEN CERTAINLY. ONE OF THOSE TOPICS SO YOU'VE BEEN ON THE FRONT LINES OF THAT ALL OF YOU AND- WE DO APPRECIATE YOUR YOUR- DEDICATION YOUR DEVOTION AND WHAT I FEEL CAME THROUGH IN. YOUR INTERVIEWS THAT YOU HAVE JUST A LOVE AN ABSOLUTE LOVE FOR THE PROFESSION THAT YOU ARE IN AND THAT MEANS SO MUCH. CERTAINLY TO ALL OF US AS PARENTS GRANDPARENTS AND CERTAINLY TO OUR CHILDREN- I WAS THINKING ABOUT HAVING ONE OF YOU ARE ALL OF YOU AS A TEACHER. AND MY CAREER PATH WOULD HAVE BEEN A JOY BECAUSE WE REMEMBER THOSE TEACHERS WHO MADE SUCH A DIFFERENCE WITH US. AND YOU COME ACROSS WITH ALL YOU KNOW HAVING THAT KIND OF FUN COMMITTEE ON JOB LOVE FOR WHAT YOU DO AND CERTAINLY FOR THOSE YOU SERVE. I AM JUST TWO QUESTIONS AND I'M GOING TO PUT IT TO ALL THREE OF YOU. ARE BECAUSE THEY'RE ON OUR MIND AND ONE HALF TO DO- THE CONCERNS THAT OF ARE RAISED IN THE DRAFT TWENTY TWO CALIBER. MATH FOR. I KNOW THAT COMING BEFORE. A ONE OF DODD COMMITTEES. HONDA I GUESS IF THE CONCERN IS THAT XCELERATED MATHIS CERTAINLY IS NOT FOR EVERYONE AND CERTAINLY IT WASN'T FOR ME HI FIND THAT WASN'T MY STRONG SUIT. I MADE IT THROUGH THAT I'M HOPING THAT WE'RE NOT LOOKING AT SOMETHING THAT MIGHT ENCOURAGE ALL STUDENTS TO STRIVE FOR MORE AND I THINK OF SPECIALLY ARE YOUNG WOMEN. WE HAVE STEM AND THAT HAS ENCOURAGED SO MANY TO GET INVOLVED IN FACT THERE'S SO MANY JUST AN ORANGE COUNTY- YOUNG WOMEN WHO'VE ENTERED THE ENGINEERING PROFESSION AND CERTAINLY BEEN INCREASE ALONG THERE ON EDUCATION PATH TO DO THAT. SO I GUESS FOR WHAT I'D LIKE TO ASK. ALL THE THREE OF YOU OR INDIVIDUALLY TO RESPOND TO WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO BE LOOKING FOR IN TERMS OF THE FINAL PROPOSAL THAT WILL COME BEFORE YOU LATER THIS YEAR FOR ADOPTION THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF CONTROVERSY OVER THE YEARS MEMBER THE NEW MATH AND- WITH OUR KIDS COULD GET ON BOARD WITH THAT AND- HOPEFULLY WE'RE NOT TAKING ANOTHER TURNED OUT TO AYE CATCHES. KIDS KIND OF IN THE MIDDLE OF REALLY GRASPING THE ON MATH AT PRESENT THAT THIS ISN'T SOMETHING THAT'LL GIVE THEM A LEFT TURN ON AS THEY YOU KNOW GO FORWARD SO ON SHARE SOME OF YOUR THOUGHTS ON THAT WITH OFF. THANK YOU LET ME START WITH YOU DR GLOVER WOODS AND THEN WILL MOVE TO MISTER MCCLELLAN AND THEN. MISS RODRIGUEZ SO GO AHEAD DOCTOR. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- TO ANSWER THE QUESTION I WOULD SAY THAT ONE OF THE- KEY THINGS THAT WE WILL BE LOOKING. FORWARD AND LOOKING AT WHEN THE DOCUMENT COMES FORWARD TO THE STATE BOARD. IS TO BE SURE THAT IT IS A DOCUMENT THAT PROVIDES THE GUIDANCE. THAT'S NEEDED FOR STUDENTS REGARDLESS OF WHERE THEY MAY BE AND MATH PASSED. REGARDLESS OF WHAT THEIR DESIRES MAYBE AROUND MATHEMATICS THAT THEY'RE ABLE TO BE. SUCCESSFUL AS I SHARED WITH YOU IN MY OPENING STATEMENT WE HAVE A VERY DIVERSE GROUP OF STUDENTS. THAT ARE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND FOR OUR STUDENTS THERE ARE. HIGH ACHIEVERS IN THE AREA OF MATHEMATICS WHO WANT TO ACHIEVE AND CONTINUE TO MOVE FORWARD. IN THAT PARTICULAR SUBJECT AREA WE WANT TO BE SURE ABOUT THE DOCUMENT THE FRAMEWORK THE MATHEMATICS FRAMEWORK SUPPORTS THOSE STUDENTS. IN ACHIEVING THOSE HIGHER ASPIRATIONS IN THE AREA OF MATHEMATICS WE ALSO WANT TO BE SURE FOR STUDENTS THAT MIGHT BE STRUGGLING WITH MATH. THAT THERE ARE THERE'S GUIDANCE IN THAT DOCUMENT FOR THE EDUCATORS THAT WILL BE WORKING WITH THEM. TO BE ABLE TO SUPPORT THEM AS WELL SO WHEN I THINK ABOUT WHAT. WOULD COME FORWARD AFTER THE ERROR RATIONS ARE. WORKING WITH THE INSTRUCTIONAL QUALITY COMMISSION AND ALL OF THE PUBLIC COMMENTS THAT WE WILL RECEIVE ON THE DOCUMENT. I'M LOOKING FOR A KITE THAT IS GOING TO BE ABLE TO SUPPORT. ALL STUDENTS. IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. THANK FOR THAT. THANK YOU MR ARE MISTER MCCALL. YES THANK YOU FOR THAT QUESTION. THAT PROCESS- WITH MATHEMATICS IS CURRENTLY UNFOLDING IN. CAN YOU HEAR ME OK. OKAY YES WE CAN'T. N. IT IS EARLIEST THIS WEEK THE INSTRUCTIONAL QUALITY- COMMITTEE IS MEETING- TO TAKE COMMUNITY IMPORTANT WRITTEN INPUT SO THAT PROCESS- AND AGAIN WE HAVE TO REMEMBER- IT'S A FRAMEWORK OF MATHEMATICS AND FRAMEWORKS ARE OUR GUIDES THEY'RE NOT MANDATED IN THE PROCESS THEY'RE NOT MANDATED FOR DISTRICTS TO TEACH FROM- WE WANT THIS PROCESS TO PLAY OUT HIM AND WIN THAT RECOMMENDED FRAMEWORK REACHES US AT THE STATE BOARD OF EDUCATION THEN WILL TAKE A GOOD LOOK AT IT. AND- AND DECIDE THEN WHETHER TO APPROVE IT OR NOT YOU KNOW THE FRAMEWORK- IS GUIDES FOR LOCAL DISTRICTS- IN THOSE DISTRICTS MAKE DECISIONS ON WHAT IS OFFERED FOR THEIR DISTRICT THERE LOCALLY- YOU KNOW I WOULD WANT CHILDREN TO HAVE OPTIONS STILL WITH THE HIGH LEVEL MATH AS WELL AS C. D. E. AND CAREER TECHNICAL EDUCATION MATHEMATICS AND- THOSE KIND OF OPTIONS AND- I WOULD HOPE THAT THE DISTRICT WOULD HAVE THAT FLEXIBILITY FOR THOSE VARIOUS PATHWAYS. YOU KNOW WHETHER IT'S A STUDENT ON THEIR WAY TO THE UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA OR STUDENTS WHO NEEDS MATHEMATICS TO BE ABLE TO BE A PLUMBER OR A BUILDER- WE WHAT WE WANT TO HAVE OPTIONS IN THESE PATHWAYS FOR ALL OF OUR STUDENTS. AND OF COURSE WE DON'T WANT TO SEE SOME OF THOSE HIGHER LEVEL MATHS ELIMINATED I KNOW THERE'S SOME MISINFORMATION CIRCULATING ABOUT ELIMINATING CALCULUS FOR SOME OF THESE HIGH LEVEL MATHS WE NEED TO. KEEP THOSE OPTIONS AVAILABLE FOR OUR STUDENTS. THANK YOU FOR MENTIONING OUT BECAUSE I THINK THAT MIGHT BE WHERE THE CONTROVERSY IS KIND OF THE MERCHANT MAYBE. A LITTLE BIT A LITTLE TIDBITS GETTING IN THE MEDIA ON THAT I COULDN'T IMAGINE THAT THAT WOULD BE SOMETHING THAT WASN'T PART OF IT. NOT NOT NECESSARILY MANDATED SO IT. YES THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THAT QUESTION AND I WILL- WHAT REPEAT EVERYTHING THAT MY COLLEAGUES HAVE ALREADY SAT. UP I AGREE WITH THEM AND I WILL JUST ADD THAT. WHEN I STARTED TEACHING IN ABIT ON BECAUSE I'M A SOCIAL STUDIES ENGLISH AND SPANISH TEACHER AT THE HIGH SCHOOL LEVEL BUT WHEN I STARTED TEACHING AB ONE OF THE- ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I DISCOVERED IS THAT A LOT OF MY STUDENTS. REGARDLESS OF THEIR GRADE LEVEL IN HIGH SCHOOL STRUGGLING WITH MATH. AND SO I THOUGHT WELL HOW CAN I HELP WITH IT'S BEEN A LONG TIME SINCE I'VE HAD A HIGH SCHOOL MATH R. SO I STARTED A BOOK. OUT WITH THAT WITH PROFESSOR JAVELIN WHO'S A MATHEMATICS PROFESSOR AT STANFORD. LATER HE AND I BECAME VERY GOOD FRIENDS AND I LEARNED A LOT. FROM HIM ABOUT MATHEMATICAL THINKING AND MATHEMATICAL CONCEPTS AND THE DIFFERENT WAYS THAT WE CAN ENCOURAGE OUR STUDENTS- YOU MATHEMATICALLY TO. PROBLEMS HOW TO OUT THE MOVE IN A LOT OF DIFFERENT AREAS IN THEIR LIFE. AND STILL. SOME OF OUR STUDENTS- YOU KNOW WILL TAKE UP PERHAPS. MAY REQUIRE LESS MATH I THINK YOU KNOW WE ALL CERTAIN CAREERS- WHETHER YOU ARE EIGHT HOUSE FRAME BURKE OR- A DOCTOR ARE RIGHT YOU KNOW THERE'S% CERTAIN. CERTAIN TYPES OF MATTHEW USED FOR CERTAIN CAREERS AND AT THAT POINT THAT'S WHERE WE NEED TO DIFFERENTIATE US AT SCHOOLS AND THIS IS A LOCAL DECISION. AGAIN WITH THIS FRAMEWORK THAT'S UP FOR DISCUSSION. ARE WE AS TEACHERS NEED TO DIFFERENTIATE WHAT MATH OUR STUDENTS NEED FOR THE CAREERS OF THEIR INTERESTED IN WITHOUT HOLDING ANYBODY. WITHOUT YOU KNOW- WHICH IS ONE OF. THE ONE OF THE MYTHS ABOUT- THIS. IS THAT YOU KNOW. HELP IS GOING TO BE GONE AND PEOPLE WON'T HAVE ACCESS TO THAT NO NOT AT ALL OF THESE PEOPLE WE NEED STUDENTS IN CALIFORNIA. FOR ENGINEERING JOBS FOR JOBS AND AEROSPACE INDUSTRY AND A LOT OF THOSE REQUIRE A STRONG MATHEMATICAL BACKGROUND. RIGHT WHETHER OR ENGINEERING OF. MOB MEMBER MCCLELLAN MENTIONED- C. T. AND THOSE PATHWAYS DOES ALSO REQUIRE CERTAIN TYPE OF MATH JOKES ARE IT'S THIS IS A VERY INTERESTING DISCUSSION AND- I'M- LOOKING FORWARD TO- YOU KNOW WHEN THIS PROCESS IS OVER HAVING. A FRAMEWORK- IN FRONT OF US AT YES YOU ARE. STATE BOARD OF EDUCATION. THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR THOSE ANSWERS I'M I'M SO IMPRESSED WITH ALL THREE OF YOU I JUST WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT I WILL BE SUPPORTING YUR CONFIRMATION NOT. I BROUGHT UP THE MATH QUESTION BECAUSE IT IS SOMETHING THAT COMES SIDE TO US. AS PARENTS GRANDPARENTS AND LEGISLATORS YOU KNOW IT IT IS SO PROBABLY THE THING THAT MUCH MAYBE. NEXT TO READING OR MAYBE ACTUALLY IN FRONT OF READING AS CREATES MOST CONSTERNATION ARE FOR PARENTS AS THEIR CHILDREN STRUGGLE WITH EITHER OF THOSE SUBJECTS AND- GIVEN YOUR- ALL THREE OF YOU YOUR INVOLVEMENT IN YOUR PASSION FOR YOUR STUDENTS OF. I THINK WE'LL SEE ARE PROBABLY A GREAT PRODUCT THAT COMES OUT OF THAT ARE WILL BE FOLLOWING IT AND THEN- ANY THOUGHTS YOU HAVE THAT YOU WANT TO SHARE WITH ME PREVIOUS. TO THAT- SUBSEQUENT TO THAT THAT WOULD BE HELPFUL BECAUSE I'M GETTING SOME OF THIS FOR MY DAUGHTER BY THE WAY AND HER KIDS SO. ANYWAY THANKS AGAIN AND DAUGHTER I'M VERY IMPRESSED WITH. ALL OF YOU AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR SERVICE AND YOUR COMMITMENT TO THE FAR THIS VERY VERY IMPORTANT UP COMPONENT OF. OUR ON OUR HUMAN AREBEING. OF HUMAN. LEARNING THE FROM. THANK YOU.

SENATOR KAMLAGER THANK YOU MADAM PRO TEM UM AND- VERY HAPPY TO BE HERE TODAY- I JUST HAVE A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS I DO WANNA AND ECHO THE SENTIMENTS OF MY COLLEAGUE SENATOR BATES- I AM A PARENT WHO HAS LIVED THROUGH DISTANCE LEARNING FOR OVER A YEAR- AND IT IS A MIRACLE- DATA I AM STILL IN MY RIGHT MIND. I AM OUT TIPPING MY HATS OFF TO ALL THE OTHER PARENTS- AND THE TEACHERS OUT THERE WHO HAVE HAD TO MANAGE THEIR WAY THROUGH THIS- IT HAS REALLY ON EARTH- A LOT OF DISTRESSING THINGS- ABOUT THE KIND OF. STRESSORS THAT WE PLACE ON OUR SYSTEMS ABOUT HOW SOME OF THE SYSTEMS WERE NOT- YOU KNOW ADEQUATELY RESOURCE AND HOW WE'VE REALLY BEEN DENYING- SOME REALITIES SOME VERY REAL. AND STARK REALITIES ABOUT HOW OUR CHILDREN ARE LEARNING IN THE PRESSURES ARE PUTTING ON OUR PARENTS- AND THE SCHOOL SYSTEMS. SO I HAVE TWO QUESTIONS AND I WOULD LIKE TO DIRECT THE FIRST ONE JUST IN THE INTEREST OF TIME TO- DR GLOVER WORDS. IT'S REALLY ABOUT ON THE STATE OF AFFAIRS WITH REGARDS TO OUR SUPERINTENDENTS. I CROSSED THE STATE THERE ARE A LARGE NUMBER OF THEM WHO ARE RESIGNING WHILE WE'VE HAD IT HAPPEN IN SAN FRANCISCO. WE'RE HAVING IT HAPPEN IN LOS ANGELES- WE'RE SEEING IT IN CULVER CITY I MEAN I AM REPRESENT THREE CITIES AND TWO OF MY CITIES OF SUPERINTENDENTS THAT ARE LOSING LEAVING- AND THEN ACROSS THE COUNTRY WE ARE SEEING THIS PHENOMENON. AS WELL AND SO JUST WANTED YOUR THOUGHT SINCE PART OF- THE WORK THAT YOU ALL DO IS ABOUT THIS SORT OF REGULATING THE GOVERNANCE- YOUR THOUGHTS ON IF- THE GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE THAT WE HAVE IN PLACE- WITH FOR OUR SCHOOL SYSTEMS IF IT'S WORKING- OR YOU KNOW IS IT UNTENABLE. BECAUSE I DO THINK THAT. WE HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY TO CREATE SOME SYSTEMS THAT WILL ALLOW FOR STABILITY- IN TERMS OF HAVING SUPERINTENDENTS COMING IN AND BEING ABLE TO DO THE WORK THAT THEY NEED TO DO IN PARTNERSHIP WITH THEIR- DISTRICT BOARD MEMBERS- TO PROVIDE THE SERVICE WHICH IS EDUCATION TO OUR STUDENTS. AND FAMILIES BUT I'M WONDERING IF WE HAVE JUST. PRESSURIZED THIS SO MUCH- THAT THE YOU KNOW THE YIELD IS NOT WHAT WE WANT AND YOUR THOUGHTS ON THAT. THANK YOU SENATOR FOR THAT QUESTION AND I WILL SAY FIRST AND AS A MOM WHO ALSO. HAD A DAUGHTER ON DISTANCE LEARNING OVER THIS LAST YEAR AND IT'S DEFINITELY BEEN QUITE AN INTERESTING RIDE- SERVING FROM BOTH ENDS AS A MOM AND ALSO AS AN EDUCATOR- TO YOUR QUESTION ABOUT THE GOVERNANCE AND THE- SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF. THAT MINISTRY- SUPERINTENDENTS THAT ARE RESIGNING I WILL SAY THAT I DO BELIEVE OUR GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE WHILE IT'S NOT- I WILL SAY NOT NECESSARILY UNDER THE PURVIEW OF THE STATE BOARD OF EDUCATION ARE BECAUSE WE DO HAVE LOCAL CONTROL. THERE ARE ON THOSE OPPORTUNITIES AT THE LOCAL LEVEL FOR SUPERINTENDENT CAN BE ABLE TO WORK IN COLLABORATION WITH THE GOVERNING BOARDS THAT ARE ELECTED IN THEIR AREA AND SERVE THE NEEDS OF THEIR COMMUNITIES- OF MIGHT I DO THINK THAT THIS LAST- FIFTEEN SIXTEEN MONTHS IT'S BEEN ONE THAT. THE VOCABULARY WORDS BEEN UNPRECEDENTED IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE HAVE NEVER SEEN AND OUR PARTICULAR LIFETIME AND I BELIEVE THAT THE QUICK NEED TO RESPOND AND IN SHORT AND GIVE IT TO ENSURE THAT STUDENTS GOT EVERYTHING THAT THEY COULD. DURING. THIS TIME- INSTRUCTION CHANGING IN AND TO REMOTE INSTRUCTION- REQUIRED A LOT OF TIME QUITE A LOT ACTUALLY AND TO THE POINT I BELIEVE I HEARD YOU MAKE ARE THERE WERE. SUPERINTENDENT DISTRICT ADMINISTRATORS PRINCIPALS TEACHERS PARA PROFESSIONALS THAT PUT IN AN INORDINATE AMOUNT OF TIME TO TRY TO BE SURE STUDENTS COP WITHIN ME. SO AS FAR AS IS THERE A NEED TO LOOK AT OUR GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE IS THERE ANY TO CHANGE ANYTHING IN THE GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE I THINK IT'S SOMETHING FOR CONTINUAL REFLECTION OR WE SERVE IN OUR ENVIRONMENT. OF CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT AND WHILE THERE ARE THINGS THAT WORK WELL THERE I'M SURE THINGS THAT CAN BE DONE BETTER. TO NOT ONLY SUPPORT THOSE WHO ARE SERVING IN THE ROLE OF THE ADMINISTRATION AND SUPERINTENDENT BUT TO SUPPORT EVERYBODY THAT'S IN THE SYSTEM AND I THINK WE HAVE A GREAT OPPORTUNITY- AS STUDENTS RETURN TO IN PERSON INSTRUCTION IN THE TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO SCHOOL YEAR. TO LOOK AT WHAT THOSE AREAS ARE THAT WE CAN LEARN FROM WHAT THOSE AREAS ARE THAT WE CAN BUILD ON AND MORE IMPORTANTLY WHAT MIGHT BE SOME AREAS THAT WE CAN LOOK AT. AT THE LOCAL LEVEL TWO AND JUST TO ENSURE THAT THE ENVIRONMENT IS ONE THAT IS SUPPORTED AND CONDUCIVE. FOR ALL THAT ARE IN OUR SYSTEM. THANK YOU FOR THE- CREDIBLY THOUGHT. ON I APPRECIATE. YOUR RESPONSE. AND MY LAST QUESTION I'LL DIRECT TO- MISTER AT MCCLELLAN. YOU I TALKED A LOT ABOUT- THE WELL NOT A LOT BUT YOU DID REFERENCE THE DASHBOARD AND- SORT OF HOW WE CAN BE MORE ACCOUNTABLE AND WOULD LOVE FOR YOU TO EXPAND ON- YOUR THOUGHTS ON THE STRUCTURE OF ACCOUNTABILITY THAT WE HAVE IN PLACE. YOU KNOW- THE LEGISLATURE- WITH THE- HELP OF THE GREAT- DR WEBBER REALLY FOUGHT FOR- L. CFF FUNDING- AND- YOU KNOW WE HAVE EL CAP- AND ALL OF THESE PLANS. AND PLANS AND PLANS AND THEN IT SEEMS AS IF- WE'RE VEERING OFF COURSE YOU KNOW THE- FOR LC FF. IT'S NOT BEING USED AS IT WAS INTENDED. AND THEN WE'RE BEGINNING TO SEE SOME CHALLENGES WITH SORT OF THE APPLICATION- YOU KNOW OF THESE PLANS ACROSS THE STATE SO JUST- WANTED TO GET YOUR THOUGHTS ON THE STRUCTURE OF ACCOUNTABILITY THAT WE HAVE IN PLACE AND- IF THERE ARE EFFORTS ARE AREAS ARE OPPORTUNITIES FOR. IMPROVEMENT ARE FINE TUNING BECAUSE I THINK AT THE END OF THE DAY- YOU KNOW WE WILL ALL BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE- TO WHETHER OR NOT WE HAVE. A DEVELOPED AND SUPPORTED AND SUSTAINED A SYSTEM. DESIGNED TO EDUCATE OUR YOUNG PEOPLE- AND ALLEVIATE SOME OF THE STRESS THAT COMES WITH THAT FOR THEIR FAMILIES AND SO- WOULD LOVE TO KNOW YOUR THOUGHTS ON THAT. MMHM THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION. WELL THE PANDEMIC HAS ADDED A NEW LAYER OF- GETTING THROUGH- TO THIS ACCOUNTABILITY PROCESS I KNOW THAT THEN WE'VE ALL BEEN. GETTING THROUGH THAT HOPEFULLY TOGETHER YOU KNOW THE STRESS THE MENTAL HEALTH BUT WE CAME TO MY MIND WITH THE QUESTION YOU ASKED BEFORE WITH OUR TO PERTINENT CHAU CHECKING IN WITH OUR STUDENTS CHECKING IN WITH OUR TEACHERS. AND OUR SUPERINTENDENT THAT'S ABOUT THEIR WELLNESS. AND THE PRESSURE AND STRESS THEY'VE ALL BEEN UNDER YOU KNOW THAT'S WHY YOU NEED TO SAY THAT FIRST BUT THE ACCOUNTABILITY YOU KNOW IN OUR ACCOUNTABILITY SYSTEM I'VE BEEN. A PART OF THE PROCESS OF BEER IN THE NORTH WITH THE L. CAP PROCESS ANDI'M I'M PROUD OF OUR RURAL DISTRICTS UP HERE IN TERMS OF THEIR- EFFORT TO REACH OUT TO THE COMMUNITY ESPECIALLY DURING THIS PANDEMIC. IN A LOT MANY DIFFERENT WAYS MOST OF IT IS REMOTELY IN TRYING TO GET INPUT. ON THEIR PLANNING PROCESS SEVERAL OF THE DISTRICT'S APPEAR IN DIFFERENT SPACES IN NETWORK PLANNING PROCESS OF THE L. KAPLAN. THEY'VE DONE A OF- EVEN THROUGH THE CLOUDINESS OF HE PANDEMIC OF A GOOD JOB IN REACHING OUT AND TRYING TO GET INPUT ON THEIR PLANNING PROCESS. AND THEN- TURNING AROUND YOU KNOW MID YEAR AND SAYING LOOKING BACK HOW HOW ARE WE DOING WITH OUR PREVIOUS PLANNING PROCESS AND I KNOW THAT'S BUILT INTO THE L. CAP. PROCESS AND I'VE BEEN PROUD OF OUR RURAL DISTRICTS ARE FOR MAKING THAT EFFORT ESPECIALLY CONSIDERING THE TIMES WE'RE IN NOW. IN TERMS OF ACCOUNTABLE FOR THE PLANS THAT THEY ARE IMPLEMENTING AND THEN ACCOUNTABLE TO MAKE ADJUSTMENTS IN THOSE PLANS- AND ALL THE LOCAL YOU KNOW IT'S A LOCAL. EFFORT YOU KNOW THAT'S BUILT INTO THE NAME- L. C. F. F. THE HOME OF THE GETTING THE LOCAL VOICE CERTAIN LOCAL PERSPECTIVE FROM PARENTS- STUDENTS AND ALL STAKEHOLDERS AND I'VE BEEN ONE WHO WERE WAS ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE TABLE NOT TOO PLEASED IN THE PROCESS JUST A FEW YEARS BACK- BUT I HAVE TO SAY I'M- A MUCH MORE. HAPPIER WITH WHAT I'M SEEING ESPECIALLY IN THE CLOUDINESS OF THE PANDEMIC AND- AND HOW DIFFICULT. IT HAS BEEN- FOR EVERYONE TO ME YOU KNOW A TICKET OTHER IN IN PERSON. ALTHOUGH MANY OF OUR RURAL DISTRICTS HAVE BEEN IN PERSON YOU KNOW AND HAVE BEEN IN PERSON UP HERE FOR SOME TIME WITH THE CHILDREN COMING IN TWO DAYS A WEEK. AND THIS IS THE MONTH TO CELEBRATE OUR TEACHERS AND- WE- WHAT WAS SAID IN THE OPENING I THINK IS HUGELY IMPORTANT WE ALL HAD A TEACHER THAT MADE THE DIFFERENCE IN OUR LIVES. IT IS THE MONTH TO CELEBRATE OUR TEACHERS TO HONOR THEM. WELL THE WAY THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR THAT- AND I CAN SEE YOUR- YOUR PASSION YOUR THOUGHTFULNESS ON THIS ISSUE AND HOW YOU ARE YOU'RE PROBABLY THINKING OF SOME VERY SPECIFIC PEOPLE AS YOU WERE RESPONDING TO THAT QUESTION I COULD FEEL THAT AND I REALLY APPRECIATE IT- YOU KNOW I WILL BE SUPPORTING THE APPOINTMENTS HERE TODAY- FOR THIS BOARD- AND I WOULD JUST ENCOURAGE YOU ALL TO FIND YOUR POWER- BECAUSE WHILE. THERE IS LOCAL AND THE WORD LOCAL CONTROL I THINK WE ALL HAVE A COLLECTIVE MANDATE- TO ADDRESS THE INEQUITIES THAT ARE IN OUR THAT OUR IN OUR EDUCATION SYSTEM AS WE SEE MORE PRIVATE SCHOOLS AND OTHER SCHOOLS THAT ARE OPENING AND HAVING KIDS COME IN. AND THEN THESE CONTINUES CONVERSATIONS AROUND- NOT HAVING ACCESS TO BROADBAND NOT HAVING THE RIGHT KIND OF RESOURCES NOT HAVING THE RIGHT KIND OF MENTAL SUPPORT FOR- OUR SCHOOLS IN OUR RURAL COMMUNITIES IN OUR URBAN COMMUNITIES AND OUR POOR COMMUNITIES YOU KNOW IT IS REALLY INCUMBENT UPON ALL OF US TO WORK TOGETHER IN A COLLECTIVE EFFORT TO ADDRESS THOSE INEQUITIES. IN WE CANNOT JUST. WISH THEM AWAY WITH GREAT BUDGETS- BECAUSE AT THE END OF THE DAY IN YEARS PRIOR IN YEARS.

IF THAT HAPPENS. HE YOU KNOW I THINK THE INTERESTING THING IS THAT EACH OF YOU. WHEN I TALK TO YOU. I HAD A PERSONAL MOTIVATION OUT OF PERSONAL HISTORY AND- WHILE WE TALKED ABOUT- OF PRACTICAL ISSUES LIKE THE PROGRAM TO HAVE MORE PEOPLE% COMPLETE CSU AND FOR YEARS ABOUT ACCESS OF THE NUMBER OF SPACES AND THOSE KINDS OF THINGS. I THINK MAYBE I WOULD JUST ASK EACH OF YOU. BECAUSE OF MISS ORTIZ MORE FOR TALKED ABOUT. A FIRST GENERATION STUDENT OF MR ARAMBULA TALKED ABOUT. HIS ENTIRE ADULT LIFE AND EDUCATION DEDICATED AND MISTER CLARK TALKED ABOUT. HIS FAMILY BACKGROUND IN THE COMMITMENT TO HIGHER EDUCATION AND PUBLIC SERVICE. I THINK I'D BE GOOD FOR EACH OF YOU TO TALK ABOUT HOW YOU TAKE THAT BACKGROUND THAT YOU ALL ENDED UP LOSING TO IN YOUR OPENING STATEMENT. AND HOW IT'S GOING TO DRIVE YOU TOWARD WHAT GOALS AS YOU SERVE OUR ON THE CSU MAYBE WE'LL START WITH SOME. DIDN'T IN OUR REVERSE GO- TO. MR ARAMBULA THAN MISTER CLARK AND MS ORTIZ MORE. THANK YOU MR ARAMBULA GO RIGHT AHEAD. M. APOLOGIES IN ADVANCE IF YOU HEARD A FEW HERE VIRTUAL BANDS IN THE BACKGROUND KAMALA IS NOW BACK TO PLAYING THE TRUMPET- BUT IN A DIFFERENT ROOM BUT HOPEFULLY. DOESN'T MAKE ITS WAY FOR ONE SENATOR COM ORDERS BACK SHE WILL SERENADE WITH THEIR SAXOPHONE AND THEY WERE TOGETHER. I'M NOT SURE COMMUNITIES THERE YET BUT WE'LL TRY AND- SENATOR LAYERED THANKS FOR THE TIME THE OTHER DAY AND FOR THIS CHANCE TO JUST EXPAND A LITTLE BIT MORE ON ON WHAT THIS MOTIVATION MEANS AND HELP WILL DRIVE TO WORK AND- I THINK. THE WAY I GUESS I WOULD THINK ABOUT THIS IS TWO FOLD. M. ONE ON A VERY PERSONAL LEVEL. I WILL JUST SAY I HAVE A DEEP SENSE WHAT MY FRESHMAN YEAR OF COLLEGE WAS INCREDIBLY HARD IT IS IT IS FOR MOST KIDS- AND YET I COULD CALL HOME TO TWO PARENTS WHO WENT TO COLLEGE. AND THEY COULD SAY YEP COLLEGE IS HARD. HERE'S WHAT YOU NEED TO DO AND COULD SORT OF TALK ME THROUGH IT- IT WASN'T UNTIL LATER THAT MY DAD SHARE THE STORY OF CALLING HOME. AND HIS MOM SAID WELL THEN COME HOME. M. AND FOR SO MANY OF OUR STUDENTS M. AN INMATE MAY I BELIEVE THAT MY GRANDMA DID THAT OUT OF PURE LOVE. I'M FOR SO MANY OF OUR FIRST GENERATION STUDENTS THEY NEED A DEEP SENSE THERE ARE SCHOOLS THAT ARE UNIVERSITIES THAT ARE FACULTY MEMBERS THAT OUR SYSTEMS ARE GONNA THEM WHEN IT GETS HARD BECAUSE IT WILL INEVITABLY GET HARD AND SO MY DEEP BELIEF THAT WE NEED TO DO THIS FOR ALL OF OUR STUDENTS BUT ESPECIALLY FOR FIRST GENERATION STUDENTS. IS PROFOUND AND WILL HOPEFULLY IMPACT ME TO CHECK TRYING TO THINK ABOUT WAYS THAT AS A SYSTEM WE CAN BEST MEET THE NEEDS OF ALL OF OUR STUDENTS AND ESPECIALLY. OUR OUR STUDENTS WHO. HAVE BEEN TRADITIONALLY THE MOST MARGINALIZED. AND THE SECOND WAY I THINK THIS IS IMPACTED ME AS I'VE SEEN MORE AND MORE. THE HUGE GAP WE HAVE TO FILL IT THE STATE ESPECIALLY HERE IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY. HOW MANY MORE COLLEGE GRADUATES WE NEED TO TRULY. MEET THE DEMAND OF WHAT THE WORKFORCE OF TOMORROW IS. GOING TO REQUIRE. AND SO I JUST HAVE THIS. DON'T KNOW HOW ELSE TO DESCRIBE BESIDES A FIRE IN MY BELLY SAID JUST MAKE SURE. THAT OUR SYSTEMS AND FOR FIFTEEN YEARS NOW I'VE BEEN TRYING TO DO THIS AND IN HIGH SCHOOLS- STROLL. FIRED UP ABOUT THIS CHANCE TED TO CONTINUE THIS WORK IN THE UNIVERSITY SYSTEM AND SO I THINK THAT PERSONAL MOTIVATION I HAVE FROM MY WHOLE LIFE STORY- ENCOURAGES ME TO JUST KEEP THINKING ABOUT HOW WE CAN DO BETTER FOR REAL KIDS. AND HOW WE CAN DO BETTER- FOR HER FOR HER COMMUNITIES. THANK YOU VERY MUCH OF MISTER CLARK. HELLO WE APPRECIATE AND RECOGNIZE THAT. I COME FROM A FAMILY IN WHICH I AM THIRD GENERATION WHO WAS LUCKY ENOUGH TO BE ABLE GO TO COLLEGE. BUT BECAUSE OF MY MOTHER'S- CONNECTION WITH THE SOLVE MY FATHER'S. PERRANCE I PHAM HEALTH. DEEP DEEP SENSE BUT WE MUST PROVIDE. CAMPUS COMMUNITIES. BETTER CONNECT COMMITTED TO REFLECTING BY THE STUDENTS THAT THEY SERVE.

LET ME- GO AHEAD AND START IN REVERSE ORDER AND MISS ORTIZ MARKET YOU WANT TO TAKE THIS FIRST AND MISTER CLARK YOU'LL STAY IN THE MIDDLE OF THE PACK AND THEN WE'LL FINISH UP WITH MR ARAMBULA. GO AHEAD. YES YOU HAS ANNOUNCED THAT THEY WILL REQUIRE ALL STUDENTS FACULTY AND ADMINISTRATION TO BE VACCINATED- I AM IN SUPPORT OF THIS- THEY WILL ALLOW EXCLUSIONS FOR MEDICAL OR RELIGIOUS REASONS WHICH I THINK IS ALSO QUITE IMPORTANT- THERE. OTHER SAFETY MEASURES FOR VISITORS AND THOSE WHO ARE UNABLE TO BE VACCINATED- THAT THEY WILL ANNOUNCE AND THAT'S KIND OF WHERE THAT THE SYSTEM IS RIGHT NOW- THEY'RE WORKING WITH THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE. SO THAT MOST CAMPUSES WILL SERVICE VACCINES SITES WHICH IS BEEN A GREAT OFFERING TO THAT LOCAL COMMUNITIES- I THINK. YOU KNOW ROLLING OUT THE VACCINE TO THE CAMPUSES- IF IT CAN BE DONE IN A TIMELY FASHION. WOULD IT SUPPORT EVERYONE REPOPULATING THE CAMPUSES WHICH I'M IN SUPPORT OF I THINK THAT IS GREAT TO HAVE STUDENTS BACK ON CAMPUS AND LEARNING THEIR I THINK. WE'VE LEARNED THAT ONLINE LEARNING CAN BE EFFECTIVE BUT I THINK THAT- IT'S MOST EFFECTIVE WITH STUDENTS IN THE CLASSROOM SO I'M HOPING THAT THAT CAN BE ROLLED OUT AFFECTED LEE AND- I THINK ANNOUNCING THAT VACCINES ARE REQUIRED IS. A GOOD FIRST STEP. IN THAT DIRECTION. THANK YOU MR CLARK. THANK YOU I WOULD GENERALLY AGREE WITH EVERYTHING THAT WAS SAID I THINK- THAT THE- SYSTEM- THAT AT AN OUTSTANDING JOB ON IN THE FACE OF A GLOBAL PANDEMIC ESTABLISHED- THROUGH- FACULTY TRAINING AND EIGHTY EXTREMELY. AGILE AND NIMBLE AS WELL AS BODY GROUP AND STAFF- THAT THEY ARE ABLE TO- MEET THE ETCETERA. AND SO IN THAT REGARD- I'VE REALLY WATCHES CAMPUS IS AS MUCH AS- I DO KNOW THAT- THERE'S NEXT THAT THERE WILL HAVE TO BE MORE IN TERMS OF ALL PRESENTS. SOME INCREASE IN THE BOB NUMBER OF CLASS THAT MY CAN TAKE ONLINE BECAUSE BE SOME OF THE ON THAT- BUT THE- THE REQUIREMENT OF BACKS. AS A GENERAL SEEMS TO BE A LOT OF ONE LOGICAL THE SPACE ON DOESN'T- THIS YEAR'S USES TO IMMENSE FACULTY STAFF- HAVE A STEP WAS A TRACTOR OF BEING ABLE TO RISE THE MOMENT FROM CONFIRMS ALL DO EVERYTHING IN MY POWER TO SO THEM. BUT I AM VERY SUPPORTIVE OF THE DRIVE TO ENSURE- FOLKS ARE VAST VACCINATED PENDING THE FDA APPROVAL- I BELIEVE THAT WHERE WE ARE NOW UNLESS SAID. PERFECTLY WE'VE NAME THAT WE'VE GOT AN INITIAL POLICY. M. CSU STAFF IS NOW IN CONVERSATIONS WITH. LABOR UNIONS WITH FACULTY GROUPS WITH STUDENT GROUPS AND TO SEE HOW WE CAN ROLL THIS OUT ON IN THE MOST EFFECTIVE WAY SO- I'M I'M VERY SUPPORTIVE OF THAT AND WOULD CONTINUE TO BE IF CONFIRMED. M. I ALSO JUST WANTED TO NOTE SENATOR BATES THANK YOU FOR SHARING YOUR STORY ABOUT YOUR MOM. AND MY MOM WENT BACK TO SCHOOL WHEN I WENT OFF TO COLLEGE AND SO AM I HAVE FOND MEMORIES OF CALLING HOME. AND AT BOTH OF US LAMENTING ABOUT WRITING PAPERS. NO I THINK WE INSPIRED MY MOM AND WE WERE GOING TO COLLEGE BECAUSE SHE DID GET A REAL ESTATE LICENSE BY PUTTING A BOOK I REMEMBER THEY ALSO PUTTING A BOOK ON ON THE KITCHEN SINK IN WHAT SHE'S DOING THE- COOKING AND ALL OF THAT AFTER WORK OF COURSE SHE WAS READING ON. READING THE REAL ESTATE LICENSE BOOKS SO SHE COULD PASS THE LOCATE. THE LICENSURE AND UP SO I WAS SHE HAD- CERTAINLY ON THAT EXPERIENCE THAT REALLY WAS SEEING HER PARENTS LOSE. THEIR JOBS AND- THEIR WEALTH WHICH THEY DIDN'T HAVE MUCH OF ANYWAY THEY HAD CHILDREN. DIED DURING THE DEPRESSION IT WAS A REAL MOTIVATING FACTOR FOR THAT GENERATION AND I THINK WE CALL IT THE GREATEST GENERATION. THEY WERE CERTAINLY ARE GIVEN BY MANY OF THE EXPERIENCES THEY HAD AND THAT'S WHAT'S GREAT ABOUT WHAT ALL OF YOU HAVE SAID ABOUT YOUR EXPERIENCES. AND HOW THAT IS MOTIVATED YOU TO REACH OUT ARE SHARING THOSE. THROUGH A VERY IMPACTFUL WAY- INSURING THAT EVERYONE EVERYONE HAS AN OPPORTUNITY IN THIS STATE AND IN THE NATION. TO RISE ABOVE. THEIR BEGINNING FAN ACHIEVE FONG THEY MERICAN DREAM SO WE THANK YOU FOR THAT. I THINK I'M I DON'T I HAVE ONE OTHER QUESTION BUT I'M GOING TO. MOVE ON TO MY COLLEAGUE SO THAT THEY HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY. BETTER AGAIN ON I CHEER YOU AND WISH YOU THE VERY. BEST THING YOU CERTAINLY WILL HAVE MY SUPPORT. THANK YOU SENATOR. AND IF WE NEED TO COME BACK WE CANNOT LEAVE THAT UP TO YOU- SENATOR COME LONGER. THANK YOU MADAM PRO TEM UM AND I TOO WILL BE A SUPPORTING AT THESE APPOINTMENTS- THIS AFTERNOON I HAVE JUST A FEW QUESTIONS AND I DON'T NECESSARILY KNOW WHO TO DIRECT THEM TO AND I DON'T WANT TO BE RANDOM SO MAYBE MADAM FOR TIME YOU CAN- TAKE THE- PERSON- YOU KNOW I ACTUALLY. CAME FROM. THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE WORLD AND I SAT ON A- A DISTRICT A BOARD- WITH NINE CAMPUSES IT WAS THAT LARGE. AND SO EVEN THOUGH I LIVED IN A PARTICULAR PART OF THE CITY- AND HAD A SPECIFIC SCHOOL IN MY BACKYARD IT WAS MY RESPONSIBILITY AS A BOARD MEMBER- TO REALLY. SORT OF PROVIDE. OVERSIGHT TO THE ENTIRE DISTRICT. TO ALL NINE OF THE COLLEGE CAMPUSES YOU ALL HAVE TWENTY THREE- AND IN READING YOUR- A BIOS AND RESPONSES YOU ALL ALL COME FROM VERY DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE STATE. AND PROBABLY HAVE SOME- PREFERENCES IN TERMS OF EITHER THE SCHOOLS OR THE PARTS OF THE STATE- THAT YOU. ALIGN YOURSELF MOST CLIENTS MOST CLOSELY WITH AND YET- WILL HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY TO PROVIDE OVERSIGHT TO TWENTY THREE CAMPUSES. SO JUST WOULD LOVE YOUR THOUGHTS ON. YOU KNOW MAYBE HOW YOU'RE NOT GOING TO PICK FAVORITES OR MAYBE HOW YOU ARE GOING TO- PROVIDE OVERSIGHT AND SUPPORT AND GOVERNANCE TO THE ENTIRE- SYSTEM- MAYBE PICKING ISSUES OR REGION'S. NOT A FAMILIAR TO YOU OR- IF THERE ARE ISSUES THAT MAYBE RESONATE WITH YOU PERSONALLY- THAT REVEAL THEMSELVES IN- PARTS OF THE STATE OR ON CAMPUS IS THAT YOU'RE NOT MOST FAMILIAR WITH. IT'S SOMEWHAT OF A CONVOLUTED QUESTION BUT I HOPE YOU GET THE GIST OF IT- WHICH IS. HOW TO KIND OF PROVIDE THAT KIND OF MACRO OVERSIGHT- TO A SYSTEM WITH TWENTY THREE CAMPUSES OUT WHILE RECOGNIZING YOU ALL MIGHT HAVE AFFINITIES TWO ONE OR A COUPLE BASED ON- YOUR OWN PERSONAL LIFE EXPERIENCES AND WHERE YOU RESIDE. THANK YOU MR CLARK LET ME START WITH YOU THIS TIME IN FAIRNESS AND EQUITY FOR ALL THREE. GO AHEAD. THANK YOU ALL TRY THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION- WILL AGAIN BUT LET ME LET ME GO BACK TO A LITTLE BIT OF MY BACKGROUND- I HAVE BEEN BORN IN SACRAMENTO MY DAD WORKED FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. SO WHEN I WAS AN INFANT OR ITS GONNA TALLER WE MOVED RIVERSIDE AND THEN WE WILL NORWALK. I BET SOME FRANCISCO- I AM I WENT TO LAW SCHOOL IN SACRAMENTO. ALL I HAVE TO GO TO- UC RIVERSIDE BUT I DISCLOSED THIS ON AS A FRESHMAN IN UNDERGRADUATE SCHOOL I STARTED AT CAL POLY SAN LUIS OBISPO- I HAVE BEEN IN DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE STATE- I HAVE WORKED WITH PROFESSIONAL EDUCATORS THROUGHOUT THE STATE. AND WHILE BECAUSE I'VE BEEN A RESIDENT RIVERSIDE CHORE- MOST OF MY LIFE- I DO HAVE A UNDERSTANDING OF THIS REGION. BUT ON THE WILL NOT BE DIFFICULT FOR ME TO- BE ABLE TO. BOB GET TO LEARN I WOULD PUT HIM ON ONE OF THE RESPONSES I SEE EACH ON CAMPUS AS KIND OF ITS OWN ECOSYSTEM IT'S ALL CONNECTIONS WITH ITS OWN COMMUNITIES. WHERE IT GETS ITS STUDENTS FROM AM I LOOK FORWARD TO- ONE VISITING ALL OF THOSE CAMPUSES I'M GETTING TO KNOW THE STAFF FACULTY AND ADMINISTRATION ALL THOSE CAMPUSES AND SO- WHY I'M ABOUT RIVERSIDE RESIDENT- I DON'T THINK I'M GONNA HAVE A DIFFICULT TIME. MAINTAINING MY OLD OVERSIGHT RESPONSIBILITY IN TERMS OF VOTING AS A MEMBER OF THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES I'M TRYING TO SUPPORT THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE MUCH OF WHAT WE CAN I'M TRYING TO BE OF A RESOURCE ON THROUGH MY BOOKS ON BOARD. TO ALL TWENTY THREE CAMPUSES. I YOU- MISS ORTIZ YOU WANNA. TACK THAT ONE. YES SURE WELL I FORGET WHICH SENIOR ADMINISTRATOR SAID THIS COMMENT BUT IT WAS SOMETHING TO THE EFFECT THAT- EACH OF THE TWENTY THREE CAMPUSES ARE CHILDREN. AND YOU KNOW YOU LOVE THEM ALL BUT IT'S JUST YOU LOVE THEM DIFFERENTLY AND AS A MOTHER OF FOUR I CAN RELATE TO THAT SO I THINK THAT'S THE WAY THAT I WOULD LOOK AT BEST BET. NO THEY'RE THEY'RE ALL IMPORTANT AND HAVE DIFFERENT STRENGTHS AND WEAKNESSES AND IT'S IMPORTANT TO EDUCATE MYSELF AS A TRUSTEE- LIKE JACK MENTIONED I'D LOOK FORWARD TO VISITING AND GOING TO DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE STATE THAT I'M NOT AS FAMILIAR WITH- AND I THINK IT'S INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT TO. REALIZE THAT EACH CAMPUS HAS DIFFERENT NEEDS AND YOU KNOW THERE'S NOT A ONE SIZE FITS ALL BUT ALSO TO UNDERSTAND THAT THERE MAY BE BEST PRACTICES ACROSS THE SYSTEM THAT WE CAN IMPLEMENT SO. I THINK YOU KNOW HAVING THE BIG PICTURE VIEW BUT THEN ALSO UNDERSTANDING THE INDIVIDUAL NEEDS OF EACH CAMPUS ARE IMPORTANT AND- EVEN THOUGH I DO HAVE YOU KNOW. MANY CSU'S IN MY BACKYARD IN THE BAY AREA I DO THINK THAT- YOU KNOW I'M JUST AS CURIOUS AND INTERESTED TO LEARN ABOUT THE ONES I DON'T KNOW ABOUT AND YOU KNOW SEE WHAT SORT OF PROGRAMS AND THINGS THAT ARE INTERESTING ARE GOING ON THERE. SO I LOOK FORWARD TO THAT. MISTER ROMULUS. I'LL SAY GO BULLDOGS- LIKE I GREW UP TWO AND A HALF MILES FROM FRESNO STATE- WE WENT THERE ALL THE TIME IS AS KIDS I WENT TO SUMMER CAMPS THERE- WE DO HAVE TWENTY THREE KIDS AND I CERTAINLY HAVE AN AFFINITY FOR ONE- BUT TO WHAT I NAMED JACK SHARED. I AM SO PART OF THE REASON THAT I HAVE THIS AFFINITY AS IT'S BEEN IN MY BACKYARD AND IT'S THE SCHOOL A NOTE MOST CLOSELY. I ALSO OPENED HIGH SCHOOL TWO AND A HALF MILES FROM SAN JOSE STATE. SO I CAN SAY GO SPARTANS. MY SISTER GRADUATED FROM SAN FRANCISCO STATE- SO I AM I HAVE CONNECTIONS TO A NUMBER- AND I'M- REALLY REALLY EXCITED. AS WE START TRAVELING AGAIN TO START VISITING MORE SCHOOLS AND TO START DEVELOPING WORK HAVE ANY AFFINITY AND JUST MORE AND UNDERSTANDING OF THE NEEDS OF VARIOUS PARTS OF THE STATE AND- I CERTAINLY. HOPE TO BRING SOME AWARENESS OF THE CENTRAL VALLEY AS YOU KNOW US FRESNO FOLKS SOMETIMES THINK THE MIDDLE AND THE STATUS IS A LITTLE FORGOTTEN. BUT CERTAINLY YOU SEE ANY ROLE I PLAY ON- IF I'M APPOINTED. TO M. B. ONE OF THE MANY VOICES THINKING ABOUT ALL TWENTY THREE OF OUR SCHOOLS AND ALL OF OUR AUXILIARY CAMPUS IS JUST ONE. THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR THAT- AND YOU KNOW- MISTER CLARK. YOU MENTIONED WANTING TO BE SUPPORTIVE OF- THE CHANCELLOR AND HIS EFFORTS AND SO JUST WHAT I WANTED TO ASK THIS QUESTION OF YOU IT WAS ONE THAT- I HAD ATTACKED. ONE ENGINE OF YOU COULD JUST SORT OF SHARE WITH US WHAT THE RELATIONSHIP IS LIKE BETWEEN THE TRUSTEES- AND THE CHANCELLOR- THAT'S THE FIRST QUESTION BECAUSE I THINK THAT RELATIONSHIP IS INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT IN WAYS IN WHICH IT IS BUILT. ON AND SUPPORTED IT IS IMPORTANT TO THE SYSTEM. AND THEN THE SECOND QUESTION IS THAT TRUSTEES ALSO. ELECT CAMPUS- PRESIDENTS AND SO WANTED TO KNOW IF- YOU. KNOW ACTUALLY HOW THE PRESIDENT'S COMPENSATION- IS DETERMINED AND THEN WHAT FACTORS ARE KIND OF TAKEN INTO CONSIDERATION WHEN MAKING THAT DETERMINATION. THE REASON WHY I ASK IS BECAUSE I HAVE A- A SCHOOL IN MY DISTRICT- WELL NOT IN MY DISTRICT BUT A DECENT. AND THESE ARE QUESTIONS THAT HAVE COME UP SO I'M I GUESS YOU COULD SAY I'M ASKING FOR A FRIEND. MISTER CLARK YEAH CERTAINLY- WELL THE CHANCELLOR- HAS ONLY BEEN THE CHANCELLOR SENSE LONG LAST FALL NOVEMBER AFFECTED- CHANCELLOR EMERITUS JIM WHITE WAS LEAVING- WHEN I ATTENDED MY FIRST MEDIA NOVEMBER- I WOULD SAY- SO FAR THE CHAT THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN- THE BOARD. OF TRUSTEES AND THE CHANCELLOR HAS BEEN POSITIVE- HE DOES M. PROCESS- FILLING SOME SLOTSHOME WHERE PEOPLE HAVE LEFT FOR OTHER OPPORTUNITIES- BUT- I WAS FAMILIAR WITH THOSE- THE CHANCELLOR EMERITUS- I SAW HIM CHAIR ONE MEETING- AND THE CHANCELLOR. AND THE AND THE WITH THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES THOUSAND GROUP SEEMS TO BE RESPECTFUL- AND- I THINK AT THIS POINT HELP- IN TERMS OF HOW- ABOUT RESIDENTS COMPENSATION IS- IS ADDRESS WILL WE JUST COME UP WE JUST HAD AN EXPERIENCE WHERE A BRAND NEW CHANCELLOR HAPPENS TO BE AT FRESNO STATE- I CALLED MY COLLEAGUE TRUMP WROTE. THIS IS HAPPY ABOUT THAT. AND WE ANNOUNCED IS- ON EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION AT THE MEETING TODAY- AND HE IS GETTING PAID THE SAME AMOUNT- HE WAS ON PAID AS THE INTERIM CHANCELLOR. I DO KNOW- IN FACT I'M I'M A MEMBER OF THE SUBGROUP IS LOOKING AT THE ISSUE OF ON EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION- I EXPECT THAT WE'RE GONNA BE TAKING UP THAT ISSUE. THE CURRENT POLICY- ENVISIONS- COMPENSATION ON TO BE DECIDED- BASED UPON PRINCIPLES OF RESOURCE FOR AND THAT'S WHAT THE MARKET STATES AND I DO KNOW THAT ON THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES WILL BE TAKING THAT OUT. AT SOME LENGTH- LATER THIS YEAR. GREAT YOU FOR THAT- AS I MENTIONED I'LL BE M. SUPPORTING THE APPOINTMENTS TODAY I THINK THIS IS AN INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT- JOB AND I THINK THERE ARE GREAT OPPORTUNITIES TO STRENGTHEN THE PARTNERSHIPS BETWEEN THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES THE CSU'S AND THE UC'S. I WOULD JUST ALSO LIKE TO REMIND YOU ALL IN LIGHT OF THE MENTAL HEALTH SURVEY THAT'S BEING CONDUCTED- FOR THE CSU'S OF THE STUDENTS THAT WE HAVE SO MANY STUDENTS IN YOUR SYSTEM THAT. OUR FOSTER YOUTH- THAT ARE HOUSING AND FOOD AND SECURE- AND THAT REALLY NEED A SYSTEM THAT SUPPORTS- ALL OF THE- ELEMENTS OF WHAT IT MEANS TO BE A SUCCESSFUL STUDENT. IT IS HARD TO LEARN WHEN YOU DON'T KNOW WHERE YOU'RE GOING TO BE SLEEPING AT NIGHT. IT IS HARD TO LEARN WHEN YOUR BELLY IS EMPTY. IT IS HARD TO LEARN WHEN YOU ARE IN A SYSTEM OR A SITUATION WHERE THERE IS DOMESTIC VIOLENCE- IT IS HARD TO LEARN WHERE YOU ARE AFRAID OF ICE IS GOING TO SHOW UP ON YOUR CAMPUS. AND YANK YOU AWAY FROM YOUR FAMILY AND THESE ARE ISSUES THAT WE ARE ASKING OUR STUDENTS TO DEAL WITH- EVERY SINGLE DAY. AND I THINK AS TRUSTEES YOU ALL HAVE AN INCREDIBLE OPPORTUNITY IN FRONT OF YOU. TO HELP MITIGATE SOME OF THOSE CHALLENGES SO THAT OUR STUDENTS CAN GO TO OUR SCHOOLS. AND FOCUS ON THEMSELVES- AND ON THEIR ABILITY TO LEARN. AND IN- JUST RESPONDING TO WHAT YOU SAID EARLIER MISTER CLARK YOU KNOW THERE'S A ARE A STATISTIC OUT THERE THAT SAYS. YOU KNOW THAT OF THE 50% 56% OF AFRICAN AMERICANS HAVE. COLLEGE DEGREES AND LESS THAN A THIRD OF THEM. OUR HOMEOWNERS. AND SO THERE IS A- DISCONNECT BETWEEN OUR ACCESS TO EDUCATION. AND ACCESS TO CAPITAL AND ECONOMIC SUCCESS AND WHILE THE NUMBERS ARE NOT EXACTLY THE SAME ACROSS ALL ETHNICITIES ON THERE ARE STRIKING SIMILARITIES WITH OTHER GROUPS AND SO I JUST LEAVE THAT WITH EACH OF YOU ALL BECAUSE WE DO HAVE I THINK A AN OPPORTUNITY TO KIND OF HELP FOLKS LEARNING GRADUATE BUT GIVE THEM WITH THE TOOLS THAT THEY NEED. TO BE ABLE TO OPEN OTHER DOORS- OF ACCESS EQUITY CAPITAL- IN GENERAL EQUITY SO FIGHT ON. THANK YOU SENATOR COM LAGER- I WOULD JUST SAY BETWEEN. LISTENING TO THE APPOINTEES TO THE STATE BOARD OF EDUCATION AND HERE IN EACH OF THE THREE OF YOU TALK. IT YOU KNOW. I STARTED OUT THIS MORNING TALKING TO A GROUP OF YOUNG WOMEN WHO ARE PART OF IT. AN ORGANIZATION CALLED EMERGE A CLASS ALL WOMEN. AND I GOT TO HEAR A FEW STORIES- THIS MORNING I GOT THE YOU KNOW TO HEAR THE STORIES OF- THE PREVIOUS- CONFEREES AND HEAR YOUR STORIES AND YOUR EXPERIENCE AS IT RELATES TO BEING.

COLLEGE GRAD I WAS THE FIRST TO GO TO COLLEGE AND GRADUATE AND- THANKFULLY I WAS ONLY TWO HOURS FROM HOME BUT IT MIGHT AS WELL HAVE BEEN THREE THOUSAND MILES. FOR MY FAMILY WHO DIDN'T HAVE TRANSPORTATION AND I WENT TO A RURAL SCHOOL. IN SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA IT'S HARD AND I CAN ONLY IMAGINE IT'S HARDER TODAY IT'SHARDER TODAY. WITH THE DIVERSITY IN OUR STATE AND THAT AND THE SOCIAL ISSUES AND- THE LACK OF RESOURCES- IT IS HARDER AND I THINK YOU SPOKE TO THAT SENATOR COM LONGER. BUT I JUST HAVE TO SAY TO MISTER CLARK'S COMMENT EDUCATION IS THE KEY I WOULD NOT BE HERE TODAY WITHOUT HAVING HAD THAT ABILITY. TO GET A COLLEGE EDUCATION AND TO KNOW THAT I COULD ASPIRE TO MORE. AND SO WHEN WE TALK ABOUT ISSUES LIKE THE GRADUATION INITIATIVE- THE ISSUE SAID SENATOR COM LAGERS SPOKE ABOUT THE ISSUES THAT WE ARE DEALING WITH THAT THE BUDGET OUT IT. CERTAINLY BUDGET RESOURCES AND SENATOR LAYERED AND- OBVIOUSLY APPROPRIATIONS ALL OF THESE ISSUES THAT WE'RE GRAPPLING WITH GET TO THE HEART OF WHAT YOU ALL TALKED ABOUT TODAY. IT IS HOW WE SUPPORT. WITH RESOURCES. OUR STUDENTS. ARE FOR THEIR OWN INDIVIDUAL ABILITIES BUT ALSO FOR THE ECONOMY OF OUR STATE. I AS WELL AS ACCESS TO OPPORTUNITY SO IT'S BEEN A IT'S BEEN A REAL JOY TO LISTEN TO YOU TALK AND TO TELL YOUR STORIES BECAUSE YOUR STORIES INFORM. HOW WE APPROACH THINGS AND SO- AGAIN I READ I READ THE RESPONSES I READ YOUR YOUR COMMENTS AND I WILL SAY- ONE OF THE BEST THINGS ABOUT BE IN THE FORMER SPEAKER. AS I GOT TO SIT ON THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES AND SO I KNOW THE ISSUES TO GRAPPLE WITH. I WORK VERY WELL WITH THE FORMER CHANCELLOR WHO I HAD A GREAT DEAL OF RESPECT FOR AND- HAVE I AM LOOKING FORWARD TO DEALING WITH- OUR NEW CHANCELLOR. AND TO SEE THAT YOU ARE ABLE TO BE SUCCESSFUL WITH THESE INITIATIVES THAT GET US FURTHER AND FURTHER. TO FIND WAYS TO SUPPORT OUR ON OUR STUDENTS AND IN CALIFORNIA WE HAVE AN ABUNDANCE OF RICHES- TWENTY THREE CAMPUSES- YOU KNOW I THINK OUR CHALLENGES HOW WE PROVIDE THE SUPPORT AND RESOURCES THAT YOU NEED TO DO THIS JOB. AND TO OVERSEE WHAT WE NEED TO DO AND CERTAINLY A PANDEMIC DID NOT HELP. OUR ABILITY AS WE WERE MAKING STRIDES FORWARD ON. THE GRADUATION INITIATIVE ON SUPPORT FOR STUDENTS. SO I'M GLAD YOU EACH HAVE THE PASSION THAT WE'VE ALL TALKED ABOUT TODAY MULTIPLE TIMES- I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR THAT AND- I WITH THAT I WANT TO SEE WHAT MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC ARE HERE TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT AND WE'RE GONNA START WITH THAT.
