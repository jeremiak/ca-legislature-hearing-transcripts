I SEE OUR FIRST AUTHOR WHO IS VERY PROMPT ASSEMBLYMEMBER REYES COME ON DOWN. THIS IS ITEM NUMBER ONE AB. SIX GOOD MORNING MADAM MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS. TODAY PRESENT TO YOU A. B. SIX A BILL WHICH CREATES THE BRANCH OF EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION INCREASING THE CAPACITY IN GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE OF THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION FOR ALL EARLY CHILDHOOD PROGRAMMING. THIS GOVERNMENT STRUCTURE CAME AS A RECOMMENDATION FROM THE SPEAKERS A BLUE RIBBON COMMISSION ON EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION WHICH WORKED DILIGENTLY FOR TWO YEARS AT ASSESSING ALL ASPECTS OF THE VERY COMPLEX. EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION STRUCTURE. OUT AT ALL IT IT. IT. THE STRUCTURE THAT WE HAVE IN CALIFORNIA AND THERE AFTER THE PREPARED A VERY COMPREHENSIVE REPORT. AS NOTED IN YOUR ANALYSIS THE COMMISSION RECOMMENDED TO THE ESTABLISHMENT OR AUGMENTATION OF AN OFFICE. OR DIVISION OF EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION WITHIN THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION. SB SIX DOES EXACTLY THAT. THE VERY NATURE OF EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION REQUIRES A VARIETY OF STATE DEPARTMENTS. A MIXED METHODS DELIVERY SYSTEM OF CHILD CARE AND PRESCHOOL AND THE INCLUSION OF A DIVERSE ARRAY OF STAKEHOLDERS. AND WITH PARTICULAR NEEDS. COORDINATION OF THESE EFFORTS IS CRUCIAL FOR THEIR SUCCESS THIS ENHANCED LEVEL OF COORDINATION WILL HELP ENSURE THE CHILDREN. FAMILIES AND PROVIDERS AREN'T SLIPPING THROUGH THE CRACKS IN THE EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION SYSTEM. AND IT ENHANCES OUR ENTIRE EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM AS A WHOLE. INCREASED COORDINATION IN EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION MEANS A SMOOTHER TRANSITION FOR THE CHILD AND THE FAMILY'S WITHIN THE K. THROUGH TWELVE SYSTEM AND BEYOND. THERE'S NO DOUBT THAT HIGHER EDUCATION AND HIGHER HIGHER QUITE QUALITY EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION ARE THE GREATEST -- GLAZERS THE CALIFORNIA CAM AND SHOULD PROVIDE FOR OUR FAMILIES AND CHILDREN AND THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE BRANCH. OF EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION WAS SURE THAT WE PROVIE THE SOCIO. ECONOMICALLY AND DEVELOPMENT LEAGUE DEVELOPMENTALLY TRANSFORMATIVE PROGRAMS IN AN EFFECTIVE AND EFFICIENT MANNER TO ACHIEVE EDUCATIONAL GOALS AND EQUITY AS INTENDED. HERE WITH ME TO SPEAK MORE ON THE MATTER IS ERIN GABLE ON BEHALF OF FIRST FIVE CALIFORNIA. THANK YOU SIMPLY WOMAN BEGIN WHEN YOU'RE READY THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AARON GABLE ON BEHALF OF FIRST FIVE CALIFORNIA IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL. AS WE'VE SPOKEN ABOUT MANY TIMES THIS COMMITTEE THE FIRST FIVE YEARS OF EVERY CHILD'S LIFE IS AN INCREDIBLY CRUCIAL TIME FOR THEIR DEVELOPMENT. AND ELEVATING EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION TO THIS DEGREE GIVING IT A BRANCH IN AN ORGANIZED WAY SOLIDIFIES CALIFORNIA'S COMMITMENT TO OUR CHILDREN DURING THIS IMPORTANT DEVELOPMENTAL TIME. IF WE TRULY WANT TO EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION SYSTEM TO WORK MOST EFFICIENTLY AND EFFECTIVELY FOR CHILDREN FAMILIES AND OUR CARE PROVIDERS. IT MAKES SENSE. TO FIND A WAY TO BETTER ORGANIZE ACROSS THIS MULTITUDE OF AGENCIES AND DEPARTMENTS THAT ARE SERVING ARE MIXED DELIVERY SYSTEM. NO OTHER EDUCATION SYSTEM IN CALIFORNIA DEALS WITH THIS LEVEL OF ADMINISTRATIVE FRAGMENTATION MAKING IT INCREDIBLY DIFFICULT FOR FAMILIES TO NAVIGATE THE SERVICES IN THE PROGRAMS THAT THEY ARE ELIGIBLE. FOR AND TO GET THEIR CHILDREN HIGH QUALITY EDUCATION THAT THEY DESERVE. IT IS INCREDIBLY DIFFICULT ALSO FOR THE EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION PROVIDERS THE SYSTEM IS EMPLOYING AND SERVING AS WELL. THE BLUE RIBBON COMMISSION ON EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION HAD MANY HEARINGS WERE THERE WERE INCREDIBLE EXAMPLES AND EVIDENCE THAT BOTH CHILDREN FAMILIES AND THEN ALSO THERE PROVIDERS. OR FINDING THE SOULS LOST IN OUR SYSTEM AT THE LOCAL AND STATE LEVEL. SO IT CREATES IT IN THE CREATION OF A BRANCH OF EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION IS AN OPPORTUNITY TO CREATE A COMMITMENT IN CALIFORNIA TO OUR YOUNGEST IN OUR MOST VULNERABLE. ENSURE THAT THE SYSTEM THAT WE ARE FUNDING WORKS BETTER FOR ALL OF THEM. DEVELOPING A STRONG EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION SYSTEM CHECK CHANGES AND STRENGTHENS THE ENTIRE EDUCATION SYSTEM ITSELF. IT MEANS MORE CHILDREN WE READY AND THRIVING WHEN THEY ENTER THE TRADITIONAL K. TWELVE AND BEYOND. IT ALSO MEANS MORE PARENTS CAN ENTER THE WORK FORCE AND UP WITH THEIR FAMILIES OUT OF POVERTY. THE US SENATE MADE A WONDERFUL FIRST STEP -- IN THE BUDGET IS SITTING ON THE GOVERNOR'S DESK AND CREATING MORE CAPACITY FOR THE CALIFORNIADEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION FOR THE EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION PROGRAMS. AB SIX IS THIS CRUCIAL SECOND STEP TO THEN CREATE THAT INFRASTRUCTURE FOR THAT CAPACITY WE ARE DRIVE UP. THANK YOU ADDITIONAL WITNESSES IN SUPPORT.

THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS GOOD MORNING EVERYBODY -- AB FORTY EIGHT IS A VEHICLE FOR A K. FOURTEEN SCHOOL FACILITIES ONE TO BE RESENTED THE VOTERS IN TWENTY TWENTY AND TWENTY TWENTY TWO THE K.. TWELVE A TO FACILITY PROGRAM IS A HIGHLY SUCCESSFUL AND TECHNICAL I THINK YOU WOULD AGREE MADAM CHAIR PROGRAM. THAT IS BASED ON PART OF A PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN THE STATE STATE SCHOOL DISTRICTS. AND AND STATES THE STATE'S SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND DEVELOPERS. STATE BOND FUNDS HAVE BEEN MATCHED BY BILLIONS OF DOLLARS AND LOCAL BOND FUNDS AND DEVELOPER FEES TO CONSTRUCT NEW SCHOOL FACILITIES ACROSS OUR STATE. TOGETHER THESE FUNDS TO BUILD NEW SCHOOLS MODERNIZE AGING FACILITIES TO ENSURE THAT THEY ARE SAFE AND UPDATED AND SUPPORTED VOCATIONAL EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMS. THESE FUNDS OF ALSO HELP THE ECONOMY BY GENERATING TENS OF THOUSANDS OF JOBS. OVER THE PAST TWENTY YEARS VOTERS HAVE SUPPORTED MULTIPLE STATE BONDS FOR SCHOOLS THE LAST ONE PROPOSITION FIFTY ONE FROM TWENTY SIXTEEN WAS PASSED TEN YEARS AFTER THE PRIOR BOND. DUE TO THE LIKE THE GAP NEW CONSTRUCTION AND MODERNIZATION FUNDS FOR PROPOSITION FIFTY ONE ARE ALREADY DEPLETED. IN FACT FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IN APPLICATIONS HAVE BEEN SUBMITTED BEYOND THE PROPOSITION FIFTY ONE FUNDING AVAILABILITY. THE NEED IS GREAT. IN ADDITION TO THE BASIC PROGRAMS NEW CONSTRUCTION MODERNIZATION CAREER TECHNICAL EDUCATION AND CHARTER SCHOOLS THIS BILL ADDRESSES MORE RECENT NEEDS INCLUDING. PROVIDING FACILITIES FOLLOWING A DISASTER REMEDIATION OF LEAD -- IN WATER FOUNTAINS REPLACEMENT OF SEVENTY FIVE YEAR OLD BUILDINGS PRESCHOOLS AT SCHOOL SITES. AND SUPPORT FACILITIES SUCH AS GYMNASIUMS LIBRARIES OR SCHOOL KITCHENS AS A MEMBER OF THE STATE BOARD OF ALLOCATION ON THE BOARD WE HAVE SEEN CHALLENGES EXPRESSED BY SMALL SCHOOL DISTRICTS. IN THESE DISTRICTS THE SUPERINTENDENT MAY ALSO BE THE PRINCIPLE OF THEIR ONLY SCHOOL THE FACILITIES DIRECTOR THE BUS DRIVER THE JANITOR ECCENTRICITY WHAT THEY NEED IS TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE. TO HELP THEM APPLY AND SECURE BOND FUNDS. THIS BILL ESTABLISHES A SMALL SCHOOL DISTRICT ASSISTANCE PROGRAM. THAT WILL PROVIDE SMALL SCHOOL DISTRICTS ACCESS TO TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE RESERVATION OF FUNDS. AND GIVE EXTRA TIME TO DESIGN PLAN AND SEEK STATE AGENCY APPROVALS VERY NECESSARY FOR SMALL TO SCHOOL DISTRICTS WHERE THAT TECHNICAL -- EXPERTISE MAY NOT BE HOUSE. UNDER THE CURRENT PROGRAMS DISTRICTS THAT ARE NOT ABLE TO MEET A LOCAL MATCH CAN SEEK FINANCIAL HARDSHIP ASSISTANCE. THIS MEANS THAT DISTRICTS CAN RECEIVE UP 21100% OF FUNDING FOR A PROJECT FULLY FUNDED BY THE STATE BOND FOR THOSE HARDSHIP DISTRICTS. THIS BILL I JUST FINANCIAL HARDSHIP TO INCREASE THE NUMBER OF SCHOOL DISTRICTS ELIGIBLE TO RECEIVE 1100%. A FUNDING SO THEY THERE THERE'S EQUITY PROVISIONS IN THE IN THIS BILL AS WELL. THE PROGRAM FOR THE TWENTY TWENTY TWO BOND IS CURRENTLY LEFT BLANK FOR CONTINUE DISCUSSIONS ABOUT IMPROVEMENTS TO THE PROGRAM.

WILL BE ADMINISTERED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE PROGRAM AS IT STANDS THEN GIVING US ADDITIONAL TIME TO CONTINUE IMPROVING UPON THE PROGRAM. CAPTION OTHER STAKEHOLDERS HAVE PROPOSALS THAT EITHER DIDN'T RISE TO THE LEVEL OF BEING PLACE BEFORE THE VOTERS OR WEREN'T ABLE TO BE VETTED IN TIME. TO MEET THE LEGISLATIVE DEADLINES SO THEY'RE NOT IN AB FORTY EIGHT BUT WE REMAIN COMMITTED TO STREAMLINING AND CONTINUING TO IMPROVE ACCESS TO THE PROGRAM. UNFORTUNATELY WE CAN'T AFFORD TO WAIT FUNDS FROM PROP FIFTY ONE THE LAST STATE SCHOOL FACILITIES BOND FOR THE CONSTRUCTION AND MODERNIZATION. OF K. TWELVE SCHOOLS HAS BEEN FULLY CLAIMED. AND THERE IS ALREADY A GROWING BACKLOG OF QUALIFIED SCHOOL PROJECTS THAT WILL GO UNFUNDED IN LESS AB FORTY EIGHT IS APPROVED. COMMUNITIES ACROSS THE STATE DEPEND ON THESE FUNDS TO BUILD NEW SCHOOLS TO ACCOMMODATE GROWTH. TO REPAIR AGING FACILITIES AND TO CREATE SPACES THAT ARE CONDUCIVE TO TWENTY FIRST CENTURY AND EDUCATIONAL STANDARDS AND TEACHING METHODS.

CALIFORNIA STUDENTS SIMPLY CANNOT FULFILL THEIR ACADEMIC POTENTIAL IF ATTENTION IS NOT GIVEN TO ENSURE THE FACILITIES ARE CLEAN SAFE AND SECURE. SCHOOL DISTRICTS THROUGHOUT THE STATE HAVE PARTICIPATED THE STATE FACILITIES PROGRAM AND HAVE DONE SO IN PARTNERSHIP WITH STATE OVER THE YEARS. THIS PARTNERSHIP HAS BENEFITED MORE THAN SIX MILLION STUDENTS. AND TALK WITH OUR MEMBERS THERE'S A SIGNIFICANT NEED FOR A. B. FORTY EIGHT IF YOU LOOK AT THE PASSAGE OF LOCAL BONTA REVIEW LOCAL FACILITIES. YOU WILL QUICKLY RECOGNIZE THE VOLUME WORK THAT STILLIS OUTSTANDING AND NEEDED THROUGHOUT ALL OF OUR COMMUNITIES. SCHOOL DISTRICT SEVEN NEED TO CONSTRUCT NEW FIFTH S. SCHOOL BUILDINGS AN AREA OF WHETHER STUDENT GROWTH. BUT THERE ALSO IS NEED TO RECONFIGURE EXISTING FACILITIES GREAT LEARNING ENVIRONMENTS THAT MEET SCHOOLS FOR THE NEXT GENERATION.

THANK YOU NEXT WIENER. HELLO I'M GLORIA CHAN WHO I'M THE VICE PRESIDENT OF FOR ADVOCACY FOR THE LEAGUE OF WOMEN VOTERS. THE LEAGUE HAS SUPPORT EVERY SCHOOL BOND MEASURE FOR THE LAST THIRTY YEARS HOWEVER WE HAVE LONG BEEN CONCERNED ABOUT SOME OF THE IN EQUITIES WE FIND IN THE FUNDING FORMULA VERTICALLY FOR FACILITY MODERNIZATION. ALL WE UNDERSTAND IT'S A COMPLEX ISSUE AND THEY'LL TAKE SOME TIME TO COME UP WITH A MORE EQUITABLE FORMULA BUT I THINK IT'S VERY IMPORTANT THAT WE DO THAT. AND ESPECIALLY THAT MAY BE PLACED BEFORE IT'S ON THE TWENTY TWENTY TWO AND THAT WE CAN RESOLVE THAT ISSUE BEFORE IN TIME FOR THAT. ALL THE JOINTS ACLU IN ASKING THAT INTENT LANGUAGE BE PLACED ON THE BILL NOW. SO THAT THE PLAN TO AMEND THE CODE OF TIME TO ADDRESS THE FORMULA OF FOOT FUNDING FOLLOW WILL HAPPEN FOR THE TWENTY TWENTY TWO BOND WE THINK THAT'S VERY IMPORTANT THANK YOU. THANK YOU. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS I'D LISKI AND WITH PUBLIC ADVOCATES -- WE SUBMITTED A LETTER JOINT -- WITH THE AMERICAN CIVIL LIBERTIES UNION. AND I CONCUR WITH ALL THE STATEMENTS THAT MEASURE ME THANK YOU [inaudible] VERY MUCH. ANOTHER TWEENER WE GOT A WHOLE NEW GROUP FOLKS HERE GO AHEAD ADAM CAITLYN ON BEHALF OF THE ADVANCE AND PROJECT TO SACK OF THE PREVIOUS COMMENTS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. SENATOR DORADO. WELL THEY BEAT ME TO THE PUNCH. FIRST I DO WANT TO THANK YOU VERY MUCH -- OF ASSEMBLYMAN AND NOT ONLY FOR YOUR WORK AND YOUR DEDICATION BUT EVERYONE ELSE HE COULD SEE THAT YOU BUILT UP AN EXTRAORDINARY COALITION -- I ALSO WANNA RAISE CONCERN -- I'M NOT THE EXPERT IN THIS BUT I DO BELIEVE I'VE SEEN. ENOUGH. TO RAISE CONCERNS ABOUT -- EQUITY -- THERE'S SOME INFORMATION AND STUDIES HAVE BEEN BROUGHT TO MY ATTENTION THAT THE US SCHOOL FACILITIES FUNDING FORMULAS ARE NOT EQUITABLE -- AS APPLIED TO HIGH WEALTH AND LOW WELL DISTRICTS SO -- I JUST WANT TO ASK YOU AS YOUR BILL BILL MOVES FORWARD WHICH I EXPECT THAT IT WILL -- WILL YOU -- MAKE AN EFFORT TO LOOK INTO THIS -- BECAUSE AS WE KNOW -- ISSUES OF EQUITY -- COME UP AND THEY COME UP MUCH TOO LATE IN THE GAME AND WE'VE GOT TO BE MUCH MORE DELIBERATE AND CONSCIOUS ABOUT ADDRESSING THAT -- ESPECIALLY WHEN THERE'S FUNDING INVOLVED SO. I JUST WANNA. YOU KNOW. ECHO THAT THAT CONCERNED -- AND ASK IF YOU WOULD LOOK INTO THAT OR KEEP THAT INFORMATION -- OR BRING THAT INFORMATION -- TOWARD TENSION AND WORK SPECIFICALLY ON EQUITY ISSUES -- AND AS FAR AS THIS FUNDING GOALS. THANK YOU SENATOR. ASSEMBLY MEMBER WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE IT WILL JUST LET ME SPEAK TO THE TO THE TO THE EQUITY ISSUE THERE ACTUALLY ARE EQUITY PROVISIONS BUILT IN. TO THIS EFFORT THERE'S A MONEY FOR SCHOOL DISTRICTS THAT ARE CLASSIFIED AS HARDSHIP WHERE THEY CAN ACTUALLY GET A 100% OF THE PROJECT FUNDED. THOSE DISTRICTS THAT HAVE LOW VALUATIONS CANTLEY FLOAT A BIG BOND -- PUT THE PROPOSAL'S WE SEEN THUS FAR ACTUALLY FROM MY PERSPECTIVE WOULD CREATE MORE IN EQUITY IN FACT IT WOULD TAKE A LOT OF MONEY AWAY FROM LA U. S. T. AWAY FROM SAMMER DINO -- WAY FROM OTHER ANTELOPE VALLEY EXCEDRIN I DON'T THINK WOULD PROVIDE EQUITY THE PROPOSES WE'VE SEEN AS A GIVE EVERY STUDENT A SET AMOUNT OF MONEY. AND PASS THAT AROUND THE STATE WILL DISTRICTS MIGHT SAVE THAT MONEY WE SHOULDN'T HAVE DISTRICTS SAVING BOND MONEY -- DISTRICTS MIGHT NOT IN FACT NEED THAT MONEY. SO WHAT WE'VE GOT TODAY IS A MODEL THAT I THINK IS WORKABLE FOR NOW CERTAINLY I'M. ALWAYS -- OPEN TO CONVERSATIONS WITH WITH ANY OPPOSITION SIR -- ANY GROUPS THAT HAVE INTEREST IN THE BILL BUT AGAIN THERE IS PLACE HOLDER LANGUAGE IN THE IN THE EXISTING BILL WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE THOSE CONVERSATIONS WITH THIS AGAIN IS A VERY COMPLEX ISSUE. AND THE PROPOSAL'S I'VE SEEN THUS FAR I THINK WOULD REALLY CREATE MORE IN EQUITY THAN EQUITY. A CLASS FOR AN AYE VOTE THANK YOU SIR HOW DO WE HAVE A MOTION. SO MOVED ALL RIGHT.

THIS IS PART OF OUR FUTURE HERE WE'RE VERY PROUD OF THEM. THEY JUST COMLETED A TEN MONTH PROGRAM AND UP HERE AT THE CAPITOL TO SEE WHAT WE DO WELCOME YOUNG SENATORS. WITH THE ASEMBLY MEMBER O'DONNELL ITEM TEN AB SEVEN FIFTY ONE THANK YOU THANK YOU. HAPPY TO PRESENT MANAGER AS A YOUNG ASSEMBLY MEMBER ABOUT HE MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS I AM PLEASED TO PRESENT AB SEVEN FIVE ONE A BILL THAT WILL ALLOW COLLEGE PREPARATION OF FURTHER BECOME PART OF OUR HIGH SCHOOL CULTURE. IN CALIFORNIA. THIS BILL SEEKS TO ALLOW LOCAL SCHOOL DISTRICTS THE OPTION. OF ADMINISTERING A NATIONALLY RECOGNIZED CALL UNIT COLLEGE READINESS EXAM. IN LIEU OF THE S. BACK TEST IN THAT ELEVENTH GRADE YEAR THAT IS SO IMPORTANT AND SO BUSY. THIS BILL IS ABOUT SMARTER TESTING NOT MORE TESTING. IT'S ABOUT STUDENTS ALSO BEING INVESTED IN A TEST. ASSESSMENT AB SEVEN FIVE ONE WILL INCREASE THE PATHWAY TO COLLEGE BY PROVIDING ELEVENTH GRADE STUDENTS ACCESS TO A REQUIRED COLLEGE READINESS EXAM. DURING THE SCHOOL DAY AND ON THE DURING THE SCHOOL TIME AND ON THE SCHOOL DIANNE HOW ABOUT THAT. CURRENTLY STUDENTS IN GRADE THIRD THROUGH EIGHTH AND THEN ELEVENTH. ARE REQUIRED TO TAKE THE ASPECT THAT'S THE SMARTER BALANCED ASSESSMENT. THIS BILL WILL ALLOW AYE SCHOOL DISTRICT TO CHOOSE TO ADMINISTER A COLLEGE ENTRANCE EXAM SUCH AS THE SAT OR THE ACT INSTEAD OF THE STATE REQUIRED ASSESSMENT FOR ELEVENTH GRADE STUDENTS. A LOCAL DISTRICTS COULD CHOOSE EITHER WOULD HAVE TO DO ONE BUT NOT BOTH. THE ALTERNATIVE ASSESSMENT WILL BE OFFERED DURING THE SCHOOL DAY AT NO COST TO STUDENTS AND IT WON'T TAKE. THREE WEEKS TO ADMINISTER. AND IF YOU'RE FAMILIAR WITH HOW TESTING WORKS AT A SCHOOL SITE OFTEN YEARS YOUR SCHEDULES ARE TIED UP FOR THREE WEEKS BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO GET ALL THE STUDENTS AND AND TO TEST THEM. AND IT REALLY IMPACTS INSTRUCTION THIS BILL REQUIRES ASSESSMENT TO BE ALIGNED TO THE STATE STANDARDS MEET FEDERAL REQUIREMENTS AND ENSURE THAT ACCOMMODATIONS ARE PROVIDED I'M GONNA REPEAT THAT. THIS BILL REQUIRES THE A SEVEN ASSESSMENT BE ALIGNED TO THE STATE STANDARDS MEET FEDERAL REQUIREMENTS AND ENSURE THAT ACCOMMODATIONS ARE PROVIDED. NEARLY FORTY FIVE SCHOOL DISTRICTS INCLUDING OAKLAND SAN JOSE AT LOS ANGELES SACRAMENTO AND LONG BEACH AND MANY OTHERS OF COURSE ARE CURRENTLY OFFERING THE SAT OR THE ACT DURING THE SCHOOL DAY FOR FREE. IN AN EFFORT TO INCREASE THE COLLEGE ATTENDANCE RATE. IN FACT LONG BEACH UNIFIED WHICH IS ADMINISTERED THE SAT FOR FOUR YEARS NOW HAS SEEN AN INCREASE. IN THE DISTRICTS COLLEGE ATTENDANCE RATE. THIS BILL IS GOOD FOR STUDENTS. TEACHERS AND PARENTS AND GOOD FOR THE CALIFORNIA ECONOMY. THIS BILL WILL REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF TESTING GIVE GIVE STUDENTS AND TEACHERS MORE TIME FOR INSTRUCTION. THE SAT IS MORE USEFUL TO TO TEACHERS I CAN ASSURE YOU OF THAT. THEY'RE SMALLER NOW THIS IS A KEY POINT THIS IS WHY I LIKE THIS THE SUPERINTENDENTS GONNA SURE OF THE REASONS THEY MY LIKE THIS. A LOT OF PEOPLE SAY THIS IS ONLY ABOUT GETTING MORE KIDS INTO COLLEGE YES IT IS BUT THIS IS KEY TO ME AS A CLASSROOM TEACHER. THE SMARTER BALANCED TESTS THE SMARTER BALANCED ASSESSMENT IS ATTACHED IS A TEST THE SAT IS AN INCEST THE SAT OR ACT IS AN ASSESSMENT SYSTEM. TO HELP STE TO HELP ADDRESS GAPS IN STUDENT LEARNING THE PSA T. OR SAT OR ACT RATHER. GUY CAN BE GIVEN IN THE EIGHTH GRADE AND SO BASICALLY WHAT YOU STARTED JUST YOU GIVE TO KIDS IN EIGHT GRADE NINE GRADE TEN GRADE. AND YOU CAN SEE. WHERE THE GAPS ARE YOU CAN WORK TO CLOSE THEM DURING THOSE HIGH SCHOOL YEARS? THE ASPECT TEST WE GIVE NOW IS NOT AN ASSESSMENT SYSTEM IT'S A SUMMATIVE TEST AT THE END OF THE YEAR. THIRD THROUGH EIGHTH AND THEN ELEVEN BUT THE PAC TEAR THE SAT YOU CAN GIVE AGAIN AND EIGHTY NINETY TEN THE PRETEST IN YOUR AGAIN YOU CAN IDENTIFY. THOSE ACHIEVEMENT GAPS NOW AS ORIGINALLY CONTEMPLATED THE ASPECT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE AN ASSESSMENT SYSTEM YOU LOOK AT THE ORIGINAL CODE SECTION. IT TALKS ABOUT IT BEING ASSESSMENT SYSTEM IT IS NEVER DEVELOPED INTO AN ASSESSMENT SYSTEM THAT'S VERY UNFORTUNATE THAT REALLY IMPACTS STUDENT LEARNING AS A CLASSROOM TEACHER. ALSO GETTING AT THE END OF THE YEAR TASK FOR THE ASPECTS SYTEM THAT'S NOT GOOD FOR US BUT WE NEEDED SOMETHING THAT WOULD AND THAT WE CAN -- THAT WE CAN EMPLOY THROUGHOUT THE YEARS THAT WE CAN ASSESS STUDENTS AND AGAIN HOPE CLOSE THOSE ACHIEVEMENT GAPS AND THE THE PS EIGHTY EIGHTY EIGHT THE PAC TEAR THE ACT OR THE ACT REALLY IS AN ASSESSMENT SYSTEM THAT BUT THAT'S WHY THIS IS IMPORTANT. TO ME BECAUSE I CAN IDENTIFY MUCH EARLIER THAN JUST THAT THAT ONE YOUR TEST WHAT I NEEDED TO LIVE BY STUDENTS TO HELP THEM CLOSE ACHIEVEMENT GAPS. LET ME ADDRESS SOME CONCERNS CONCERN NUMBER ONE THE SAT OR ACT DOES NOT ALIGN. WITH THE STATE'S CONTENT STANDARDS UNDER THIS BILL THE STATE SUPERINTENDENT MAY NOT AUTHORIZE AN ALTERNATE ASSESSMENT UNLESS IT HAS BEEN DEEMED. TO MEET THE STATE'S CONTENT STANDARDS BASED ON APPROVAL FROM THE US DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION THEY HAVE TO APPROVE THIS. IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT THERE IS NO ONE TEST NOT EVEN THE S. BACK. THAT IS COMPLETELY ALIGNED TO COMMON CORE STANDARDS. EACH OF THE THIRTEEN COMMON COURTS STATES MAY HAVE CHANGED OR ADDED TO THE STANDARDS BUT THE S. BACK IS THE SAME TEST. FOR ALL THOSE STATE EVEN THOUGH THEIR STANDARDS MAY NOT BE THE SAME. A STUDY BY MICHAEL KERR LANDER AND KRAMER CONE FROM UC DAVIS I'M PREDICTING COLLEGE SUCCESS. CONCLUDES THAT THE S. BACK AND SAT ARE ALIGNED. SMARTER BALANCED ASSESSMENT SCORES DO NOT PREDICT FIRST YEAR DO NOT PREDICT FIRST YOUR GPA AND SECOND YOUR EXPERIENCE RATES AS WELL AS S. A. T. SCORES. BUT THE DIFFERENCE A MAGNITUDE IS TRIVIAL. SO THEY BOTH WORK ONE OTHER POSSIBLE X. AN EXPLANATION FOR THESE FUNDAMENTAL SIMILAR IS IS THAT THERE IS AN OVERLAP AND THE KNOWLEDGE AND SKILLS ASSESSED BY THE SMARTER BALANCED ASSESSMENT AND SAT. THEY HAVE CONCLUDED. IN TERMS OF ACCOUNTABILITY. THIS BILL REQUIRES THE SAME REPORTING FOR ALTERNATIVE SCORES AS THE ASPECTS SCORES THE SCORES CAN BE A LINE THROUGH CONCORD AND SAY SO THE STUDIES TO ALIGN THE SCORES. TO GET A SAT OR ACT. SCORE FOR EACH S. BACK PERFORMANCE LEVEL. IF IT CANNOT BE DONE THIS BILL CANNOT BE IMPLEMENTED PER THE BILL -- CONCERN NUMBER TWO THE SAT IS CULTURALLY BIASED AND GRADES ON BUILDERS. THE SAT RESERVE WAS REDESIGNED IN TWENTY SIXTEEN TO ALIGN WITH THE COMMON CORE STANDARDS. AS AN ACHIEVEMENT TESTS THE SCORES ARE NOT A SIGN ON A BELL CURVE TWENTY SIXTEEN IT STOPPED. WE SHOULD NOT EXPAND THAT ONE OF THE OTHER ARGUMENTS WE SHOULD NOT EXPAND THE USE OF ADMISSION TESTS. M. I'M NOT HERE TO ADVOCATE FOR ONE TEST OR ANOTHER BUT AS LONG AS IT'S A REQUIREMENT FOR COLLEGE ADMISSIONS. THIS BILL IS ABOUT LEVELING THE PLAYING FIELD AND PROVIDING OPPORTUNITIES TO ALL STUDENTS REMEMBER KIDS GO TO SCHOOL OUT OF STATE THEY MIGHT ALWAYS NOT ALWAYS GO TO A CSU YOU'RE OR YOU SEE. AND AT GOING TO GPO GPA ONLY -- CREATES A LOT OF ACTIVITIES BECAUSE NOT EVERY SCHOOL HAS THE SAME GRADING SCALE NOT EVERY SCHOOL HAS HONORS CLASSES INTERNATIONAL BACCALAUREATE AP CLASSES TO BOB. THATTHAT GPA ABOVE THAT FOUR POINT OH LEVEL. CONCERN NUMBER FOR THE SAT ACT DO NOT PROVIDE PROPER ACCOMMODATIONS. THIS BILL AND FEDERAL LAW REQUIRE ACCOMMODATIONS ACCOMMODATIONS ARE PART OF THE PEER REVIEW PROCESS REQUIRED FOR APPROVAL BY THE US DEPARTMENT. OF EDUCATION. ACCOMMODATIONS ARE BASED ON A STUDENT'S I EP OR FIVE OH FOUR PLAN ON ARE COORDINATED BY A SCHOOL STAFF MY SCHOOL STAFF OR COUNSELOR IT'S BETTER TO HAVE. SOMEONE -- FROM THE SCHOOL STAFF A COUNSELOR -- MAYBE SOONER ACTION WITH THE WITH WITH SPECIAL EDUCATION TEAM WHEN WHEN IMPLEMENTING THESE TESTS ARE TAKING THESE TESTS OF THE SCHOOL LEVEL WHY HAVE A PARENT TRYING TO GO SHEET THAT ON A SATURDAY MORNING. AT A PLACE FAR AWAY FROM THE HIGH SCHOOL. IF ALL THE REQUIREMENTS ARE NOT BAD. THE STATE THE THE SUPERINTENDENT WILL NOT APPROVE THE ALTERNATE ASSESSMENT. THE CURRENT COLLEGE ADMISSIONS SCANDAL MAKES THE CASE FOR AB SEVEN FIVE ONE BY ENSURING THAT ALL STUDENTS HAVE ACCESS TO THE TEST. AND PROVIDING A SIX SECURE ENVIRONMENT FOR THAT TEST I KNOW FROM MY OWN PERSONAL EXPERIENCE THURMOND QUESTIONS ABOUT S. BACK. DIA SAFETY ASSOCIATED WITH THE THE S. BACK TEST AS WELL. SO THIS BILL IS ABOUT EQUALITY EQUITY AN OPPORTUNITY. PEOPLE ON THE GROUND NEED THIS TOOL STUDENTS NAY THIS TOOL TEACHERS NAY THIS TOOL PARENTS NEED THIS TOOL CALIFORNIA NEEDS THIS TOOL I TURN IT BACK TO YOU MANAGER WITH ME TODAY IS A DOCTOR ROSANNA MACHETE -- FROM THE SUPERINTENDENT OF THE NAP ALL NAPA VALLEY UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT AND JASON CHAN IS HERE -- WITH THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF STUDENT COUNCILS. THANK YOU SIMPLY MEMBER WELCOME TO WITNESSES TWO MINUTES EACH. GOOD MORNING MADAM MADAM CHAIR COMMITTEE MEMBERS AGAIN MY NAME IS DOCTOR ASSIGNMENT -- SETTING I CURRENTLY SERVE AS A SUPERINTENDENT OF THE NAPA VALLEY UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT AND I'M JUST COMPLETING MY FIRST YEAR IF TENURE THERE AFTER SERVING ALSO FIVE YEARS AS THE DEPUTY SUPERINTENDENT OF THE FAMILY UNDER UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT. I'M HERE TODAY BOTH ON BEHALF OF THE ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA SCHOOL ADMINISTRATORS AND ON BEHALF OF Y DISTRICT IN SUPPORT OF AB SEVEN FIFTY ONE AFTER IMPLEMENTING THE SAT DAY AS A COLLEGE READINESS INITIATIVE IN BOTH THE FAMILY UNDER UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT AND NOW AND NAPA VALLEY. I KNOW COLLEAGUES DISTRICT AND SCHOOL ADMINISTRATORS ACROSS THE STATE OR SUPPORTIVE OF AB SEVEN FIFTY ONE BECAUSE IT ADDRESSES THE COLLEGE OPPORTUNITY GAP. THAT PLAGUES ARE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC SCHOOL SSTEMS BY OPENING DOORS TO HIGHER EDUCATION. FOR STUDENTS THROUGH OFFERING A COLLEGE ENTRANCE TESTS LIKE THE SAT OR S. H. A. B. C. T. DURING THE SCHOOL DAY AGAIN AT NO COST FOR ALL STUDENTS. AS LONG AS HE'S TO SERVE AS A CRITICAL COMPONENT OF THE COLLEGE ADMISSION PROCESS HOW CAN SCHOOL SYSTEMS NOT OFFER. THIS OPPORTUNITY WITHIN THE CONTEXT OF THEIR OWN HOME HIGH SCHOOL ENVIRONMENT IF WE ARE SERIOUS ABOUT COLLEGE AND CAREER AT THE STATE LEVEL THIS INITIATIVE NEED YOUR SUPPORT AND YOUR APPROVAL. IT'S REALLY PROBLEMATIC IF WE CONTINUE TO SUSTAIN THE STATUS QUO REALITY WHERE BY IT IS UP TO FAMILIES AND STUDENTS ALONE OUTSIDE OF THE SCHOOL TO FIND THEIR WAY TO THIS IMPORTANT COMPONENT OF THE COLLEGE PATHWAY. THIS COLLEGE ADMISSION REQUIREMENTS SHOULD NOT HAPPEN FOR STUDENTS DESPITE THE SCHOOL DISTRICT BUT RATHER BECAUSE OF THEIR SCHOOL DISTRICT. LIKE I MENTIONED I SUCCESSFULLY ABOUT SCALED PSC TI IN AS EIGHTY DAYS IN SAN LEANDRO CONDUCTED A PILOT THIS YEAR IN ENVY YOU ES DE AND I WILL BE SCALING IT NEXT YEAR IN THE TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY TWENTY SCHOOL YOUR FOR ALL OF MY HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS. YOU MAY I ASK WHY A NEW SUPERINTENDENT. WOULD PRESENT THIS INITIATIVE AS A NON NEGOTIABLE TO THEIR LOCAL SCHOOL BOARD STAFF AND PARENT COMMUNITY SIMPLY PUT IMPLEMENTING THE S. E. T. DAY HAS BEEN ONE OF THE MOST TRANSFORMATIONAL INITIATIVES. OF MY PROFESSIONAL TWENTY YEAR CAREER HERE'S THE BOTTOM LINE BY ENSURING. I'M SORRY BY ENSURING TRUE EQUITABLE ACCESS TO THE S. EIGHTEEN THE SCHOOL SETTING TO ALL STUDENTS PARTICULARLY THOSE WHO'VE BEEN HISTORICALLY UNDER SERVED. THIS SIMPLE SYSTEMIC ACT PROVIDED THE KEYS TO THE DOOR THAT HAVE NOT ALWAYS BEEN OPENED. IN MY EXPERIENCE IT EXPERIENCE SUDDENLY A SIGNIFICANT MAJORITY OF STUDENTS WERE TALKING ABOUT COLLEGE THE SAT DAY OPENS THE DIALOGUE ACROSS ALL OF YOUR HIGH SCHOOL CAMPUS. STUDENTS WHO MAY NOT HAVE BEEN AGGRESSIVELY PURSUING THE COLLEGE OPTION SUDDENLY ARE EXPLORING THE COLLEGE OPTION THIS IS ALSO TRUE FOR PARENTS IMMIGRANT PARENTS OF POTENTIAL FIRST GENERATION STUDENTS LIKE MINE THREE DECADES AGO ALSO SUDDENLY HAVING CONVERSATIONS ABOUT COLLEGES THEY RECEIVE LITERATURE AT THEIR HOMES. AND ASK QUESTIONS ABOUT THE BIG TEST DAY ON CAMPUS AS WE STRATEGICALLY MARKET EFFORTS TO OUR PARA COMMUNITIES PARTICULARLY THOSE THAT ARE CULTURALLY AND LINGUISTICALLY DIVERSE. IF WE WANT TO QUICKLY CREATE A COLLEGE GOING CULTURE AND ON OUR HIGH SCHOOL CAMPUSES HERE IN CALIFORNIA AND REMOVE ENTRENCHED BARRIERS LIKE I DID FOR MY STUDENTS AT ALL OF MY HIGH SCHOOLS. I SAY ADMINISTER THE S. C. T. DAY IF LOCAL DISTRICTS AND SCHOOL BOARDS LIKE MINE DECIDE TO LEAD FROM THE PRINCIPLES OF EQUITY AND SOCIAL JUSTICE. I SAY IMPLEMENT THE SAT DAY. Q.

MADAM CHAIR -- GOOD MORNING MY NAME IS JASON CHAN AND I'M A HIGH SCHOOL JUNIOR FROM -- SAN FRANCISCO -- MOST OF THE GOVERNMENTAL AFFAIRS POLICY DIRECTOR FOR THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF STUDENT COUNCILS AND WE STRONGLY SUPPORT THE PATHWAYS TO COLLEGE ACT BECAUSE IT INCREASES ACCESS TO A CRUCIAL ABOUT -- ARE CRUCIAL ASPECT OF COLLEGE ADMISSIONS THE SAT AND ACT. SAT AND ACT OR SUPPORTED BY MARRIOTT A FREE TEST PREPARATION RESOURCES FOR THE COLLEGE WERE ITSELF OR FROM SERVICES LIKE KHAN ACADEMY WHICH MAKES DURING PREPARATION FOR THE EXAM MORE EQUITABLE AND EASY ACCESS. AND BECAUSE THE SCORE THAT STUDENTS EARN ON THE ACT AND SAT CAN BE USED TO APPLY TO COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES AROUND THE COUNTRY STUDENTS RECOGNIZE THE WRECKED BENEFITS FROM THE RESULTS AND ARE GREATLY. INCENTIVIZE TO DO THEIR BEST RESULTING IN A MORE ACCURATE AND POSITIVE ASSESSMENT OF STUDENTS AND THEIR SCHOOLS. THE S.

YOU CAN SIT RIGHT OVER HERE. BEGIN WHEN YOU'RE READY TO WITNESSES TWO MINUTES EACH. MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS I'M BRIAN RIVAS REPRESENTING THE EDUCATION TRUST WEST. OF CERTAINLY APPRECIATE THE INTENT. AND APPLAUD EFFORTS LIKE THE ONES THAT WE JUST HEARD ABOUT ABOUT FREE AS THE T. DAY. OF THE CONCERN WE HAVE WITH THIS BILL I'LL I'LL. LIFT UP TO CONCERNS THAT WE THINK -- RESULT IN A NET NEGATIVE WHEN YOU DO WHEN YOU LOOK AT ALL THE TRADE OFFS INVOLVED WITH THIS BILL. FIRST HAS TO DO WITH COMPARABILITY OF SCORES. WE ARE VERY CONCERNED ABOUT UNDERMINING THE EFFECTIVENESS OF OUR NEW ACCOUNTABILITY SYSTEM IN THE CALIFORNIA SCHOOL DASHBOARD. AND THAT RELIES ON BEING ABLE TO COMPARE STUDENT ACHIEVEMENT ACROSS DISTRICTS AND THEN HOLDING DISTRICTS ACCOUNTABLE TO COMMON STANDARDS. FOR STUDENT ACHIEVEMENT. SO WHAT THIS DOES IS IT SAYS THAT WE'RE GOING TO USE ONE SET OF TESTS AND SOME DISTRICTS IN THE DIFFERENCE THAT. IN OTHERS. IN PROPONENTS MAY ARGUE THAT THE THE SCORES CAN BE CORRELATED AND WE CAN USE THEM INTERCHANGEABLY. WE DISAGREE WITH THAT AND WE THINK LOTS OF THINGS CAN BE CORRELATED -- BUT STILL BE VERY DIFFERENT HEIGHT AND WEIGHT CAN BE CORRELATED BUT THE OBSERVATION OF WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING AT IS STILL VERY DIFFERENT. SO WE THINK IT'S A MISTAKE TO SAY THAT WE'RE GONNA USE DIFFERING TESTS FOR THE SAME PURPOSE IN THE DASHBOARD AND THAT'S GOING TO WEAKEN OUR ABILITY TO SEE WHAT'S GOING ON IN DISTRICTS AND SEE. WHETHER DISTRICTS ARE PREPARING STUDENTS NOT ONLY TO TAKE THE TEST BUT GAME ADMISSION AND SUCCEED AT THE POST SECONDARY LEVEL -- AND REMEMBERED THE NEW ACCOUNTABILITY SYSTEM IS A PASSIVE ONE TRANSPARENCY IS REALLY ALL WE HAVE GOING FOR IS THAT. THINGS ARE NOT GOING WELL IN A DISTRICT THE ABILITY TO SEE THAT IS REALLY ALL WE'VE GOT. AND IT'S GOING TO CLOUD THE ABILITY OF THE STATE TO DIRECT SUPPORTS WHAT WE THINK IT'S NEEDED. SECONDLY WE SEE BIG PROBLEMS WITH THE S. A. T.. THE DATA DON'T LIE WHEN YOU LOOK AT OUTCOMES AFRICAN AMERICAN AND LATINO STUDENTS SCORE BELOW. ASIAN AND WHITE PEERS. WHAT THIS BILL WOULD DRAMATICALLY TO IS THE ESCALATOR OR INCREASE THE USE OF THE S. A. T. IN PUBLIC EDUCATION BOTH BOTH AT THE HIGHER EDUCATION LEVEL? AND A KEY -- TWELVE WE THINK THAT'S A MISTAKE. WE THINK THAT -- THE RECENT COLLEGE ADMISSIONS SCANDAL JUST KIND OF REMINDED US WHAT MANY RESEARCHERS HAPPENS TELLING US FOR A LONG TIME IS THAT. OTHER MEASURES ARE VALUE AVAILABLE LIKE HIGH SCHOOL GPA OR EVEN HIGH SCHOOL GPA IN COMBINATION WITH S. BACK WERE RIGHT NOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING WITH THIS BILLS PROLIFERATING -- A BARRIER TO HIGHER EDUCATION BIG BY BOLSTERING THE S. A. T. THAT DATA SHOW ARE. THE SAT IS KEEPING STUDENTS OUT WHO HAVE DEMONSTRATED A HIGH PROBABILITY FOR SUCCESS -- WE THINK A DIFFERENT APPROACH LIKE WHAT'S EMBODIED IN A RESOLUTION BY MR MCCARTY IS A PREFERABLE WAY TO GO YOU OUGHT TO BE ASKING THE SYSTEMS TO TAKE A LOOK AT BEST A TEA IN ITS SHORTCOMINGS. AND IF THEY FIND WHAT RESEARCHERS HAVE BEEN TELLING US FOR QUITE SOME TIME PHASE THAT OUT. SO. WE WOULD ASK THAT YOU YOUR THREE MINUTES SO SHE HAS ONE MINUTE NO PLEASE. NEXT WITNESS YOU HAVE ONE MINUTE. YES THANK YOU MADAM TURN MEMBERS LISKI AND WITH PUBLIC ADVOCATES -- WE OPPOSE THE MEASURE ALONG WITH OUR COMMUNITY PARTNERS CALIFORNIANS FOR JUSTICE AND CALIFORNIANS TOGETHER. STUDENT ORGANIZATIONS IN AN ORGANIZATION OF FOCUSING ON THE SUCCESS OF ENGLISH LEARNERS -- WE OPPOSE BECAUSE WE THINK THAT WE SHOULD NOT A PRIVILEGE THE SAT AND THAT A WHILE WE CAN'T CHANGE. OUT OF STATE COLLEGES REQUIREMENTS WE CAN USE OUR POWERS AS A NATIONAL LEADERS FOR GOOD BY SETTING THE THE STANDARD THAT WE WON'T PRIVILEGE THIS -- THE THE LET THE PLAYING FIELD FOR LOW INCOME STUDENTS ABILITY TO ACCESS PREPARATION RETAKING THE EXAM WHEN NECESSARY WE DON'T BELIEVE THAT'S GUARANTEED IN THE BILLAND WE ALSO HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT ACCOMMODATION. THE ACCESSIBILITY OF FOR ALL LANGUAGE AND ABILITIES IS REALLY NOT PART OF THE GOAL OF THE ACT OR SAT. AND FOR THESE REASONS -- WE OPPOSE AND WE URGE AND NO VOTE THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH OTHERS IN OPPOSITION. GOOD MORNING -- MADAM CHAIRPERSON MARK THIS YEAR AGO CITY AS REPRESENTING THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION FOR BILINGUAL EDUCATION AND REPRESENTING CALIFORNIANS TOGETHER. AND WE OPPOSE FOR THE REASONS ALREADY GIVEN A PROVIDED BY PUBLIC ADVOCATES AND THE REPRESENTATIVE FROM A TRUST WEST THANK YOU [inaudible] YOU. GOOD MORNING PARTIAL TRAVIE WITH THE UC SANTA SO SOLUTION WITH A CORD THE CONCERNS ARE THE BROUGHT UP AND ALSO SEND OPPOSITION. REPORTER AT THAT WE ALREADY ARE QUESTIONING THE THE USE OF A C. T. AS AN ADMISSIONS PROCESS AT ALL UNIVERSITIES AND GIVEN ALL OF THE DATA THAT'S OUT THERE WE DON'T THINK IT'S TIME TO EXPAND THE USE OF THESE TEST SCORES. THANK YOU. IMAN MAJID WITH THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES CHANCES OFFICE WE DON'T HAVE A FORMAL POSITION ON THIS BILL BUT WE ARE CONCERNED ABOUT EXPANDING THE USE OF STANDARDIZED TESTING WHEN IT'S BEEN SHOWN THAT THESE TESTS HAVE A WEAK RELATIONSHIP WITH FUTURE STUDENT SUCCESS. CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES HAVE ALREADY REMOVED ASSESSMENT TESTING OR ALREADY REMOVING ASSESSMENT TESTING AS A MEANS OF COURSE PLACEMENT THANK YOU. THANK YOU ADDITIONAL OPPOSITION. SEEING AND HEARING THEN WE'LL GO BACK TO THE COMMITTEE ANY QUESTIONS COMMENTS. CENTER DURACELL. YES -- ASSEMBLY MEMBER CAN. ESCAPE COULD YOU RESPOND TO TO THE ISSUES THAT WERE RAISED ON THE COMPATIBILITY ACROSS DISTRICTS AND SECOND IS -- SAT SCORES BIAS AGAINST -- COMMITTEES OF COLOR OR LOW INCOME STUDENTS AGAIN THIS BILL IS IN ABOUT. WHETHER OR NOT THE SAT OR ACT SHOULD BE USED FOR COLLEGE ENTRANCE -- AS A MEASURE OF COLLEGE ENTRANCE THIS IS AS LONG AS IT'S GOING TO BE REQUIRED. WHY WOULDN'T WE GIVE OUR STUDENTS THIS OPPORTUNITY TAKEN AT THE HIGH SCHOOL LEVEL? NOW AGAIN -- WITH SOME OF THE QUESTIONS RAISED -- THIS BILL CHARGES THIS THE THE THE SUPERINTEND WOULD HAVE TO APPROVE. ALTERNATIVE ASSESSMENTS AND THE ASSESSMENTS MUST MEET SPECIFIED REQUIREMENTS THEY MUST BE ALIGNED TO THE STATE -- STANDARDS MUST BE -- CON KOREAN STUDIES -- TO ENSURE THAT THIS IS A FAIR TEST TO ENSURE THIS TEST ALIGNS. WITH OUR ACCOUNTABILITY SYSTEM. CAN. CAN I JUST ALL OF THESE -- FIVE AS THOSE QUESTIONS COME UP OBVIOUSLY RAISES A A BIT OF A RED FLAG WHICH I'M SURE YOU'VE. DONE A LOT OF WORK WITH -- WHAT APPEALS TO ME IS THAT -- THERE IS THERE ARE A NUMBER OF THINGS THAT HAVE TO BE DONE BEFORE -- THIS IS ACTUALLY IMPLEMENTED ONE AND SECOND -- YOUR THINKING OUT OF THE BOX AND I THINK THAT'S IMPORTANT IN EDUCATION PUBLIC EDUCATION RIGHT NOW WE HAVE GOT TO TAKE. UP MORE DRAMATIC STEPS. IN THE DIRECTION OF NOT THE SAME OLD SAME OLD BECAUSE IT'S IT'S JUST NOT WORKING -- FOR TWO DAYS NEEDS AND FOR TODAY STUDENTS SO THOSE KINDS OF THINGS REALLY APPEALED TO ME AND JUST TO WATCH OUT FOR THE THINGS THAT ARE BROUGHT UP BY BUT OTHER FOLKS BECAUSE I DO THINK THAT THEY'RE VALID.

ASSEMBLY MEMBER WEBER THANK YOU FOR YOUR PATIENCE WE ARE MOVING TO ITEM FOR AB ONE NINETY SEVEN BEGIN WHENEVER YOU'RE READY. THANK YOU AND GOOD MORNING -- MADAM CHAIR AT ME AND MEMBERS I'M HERE TO PRESENT TO YOU A. B. ONE NINE SEVEN WHICH REQUIRES SCHOOL DISTRICTS THAT OFFER A KINDERGARTEN PROGRAM. TO IMPLEMENT AT LEAST ONE FULL DAY OF KINDERGARTEN. ACCORDING TO THE EDUCATION COMMISSION OF THE STATES. FULL DAY KINDERGARTEN ATTENDANCE CAN HELP THOSE ACHIEVEMENT GAPS EARLY ON IN A CHILD'S EDUCATION. LONGER SCHOOL DAYS IN ABLE CHILDREN TO RECEIVE MORE INDIVIDUALIZED ACADEMICALLY FOCUSED AND MEANINGFUL INSTRUCTION FROM TEACHERS AS WELL AS MORE TIME INTERACTING WITH THEIR PEERS. THIS CAN LEAD TO INCREASED SCORES AND GREATER LONG TERM ACHIEVEMENT. THE POSITIVE EFFECTS OF THE FULL DAY KINDERGARTEN ARE EVEN MORE PRONOUNCED FOR MINORITY AND LOW INCOME CHILDREN. HOWEVER A TWENTY SEVENTEEN ITS SOURCE REPORT STATES THAT ONLY SERVING KINDERGARTEN AGE CHILDREN ARE OFFERING FULL DAY KINDERGARTEN. CALIFORNIA LEADS BEHIND MANY OF THE STATES THAT OFFER FULL DAY PROGRAMS FOR A LARGER PORTION OF THEIR KINDERGARTEN POPULATION. BECAUSE MORE AND MORE CHILDREN PARTICIPATE IN PRESCHOOL IT EARLY EDUCATION PROGRAMS KINDERGARTEN IS NO LONGER THERE FIRST SCHOOL EXPERIENCE. MANY ARE USED TO A FULL DAY PROGRAM AND READY FOR A FULL DAY OF KINDERGARTEN. THE DIESEL HOURS PROVIDED AND AB ONE NINE SEVEN WOULD EXPAND INSTRUCTION TIME FOR ALL STUDENTS GIVE TEACHERS THE OPPORTUNITY TO PROVIDE AN ACADEMICALLY RICH EXPERIENCE FOR EVERY YOUNG LEARNER. SOME OF YOU MAY KNOW THAT WE IS THAT AS A AS A STATE DID A STUDY ON ON ALL DAY CAN ABOUT ALL FULL DAY KINDERGARTEN SOME YEARS AGO AND FOUND IT. THAT AS IS POINTED OUT ONLY 70% OF OUR SCHOOLS ARE OFFERING IT -- THAT IT HAS A TREMENDOUS AND POSITIVE EFFECTS ON ON CHILDREN PARTICULARLY THOSE OF LOW INCOME AND OBVIOUSLY IT HELPS IN TERMS OF WHAT WE HAVE NOW WHICH IS TO WORKING FAMILIES. AND HAVING A THREE HOUR KINDERGARTEN EXPERIENCE AS AN ADVERSE AFFECT ONE CHILD CARE AND OTHER KINDS OF THINGS THAT ARE THERE. SO THIS -- THIS BILL HAS BEEN -- OBVIOUSLY IT'S A PRIORITY FOR GOVERNOR MORE RECENTLY -- LAST YEAR WE PUT A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS INTO A TO HELP SCHOOLS MAKE THE TRANSITION ISSUES BUT IT HAS THREE HUNDRED MILLION AND IT. SO WE NEED TO REQUIREOUR SCHOOL DISTRICT TO AT LEAST OFFER ONE PROGRAM A FULL DAY KINDERGARTEN I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE BOTH. THANK YOU SIMPLY MEMBER AS THEIR ADDITIONAL SUPPORT.

SO WE HOPE THAT WITH AN EXTENDED TIME FRAME AND IN LINE WITH THE THREE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS THAT WAS APPROVED BY THE BUDGET CONFERENCE COMMITTEE. SCHOOL DISTRICT WILL HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO BETTER TRANSITION TO A FULL DAY PROGRAM THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING MY THOUGHT ABOUT IT AND WE HAVE ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA SCHOOL ADMINISTRATORS AXALTA SUPPORTIVE AMEND THAT ON THE BILL I'LL BE COMING DOCTOR WEBER FOR THE EFFORTS TO TRY TO INCREASE ACCESS FOR KINDERGARTEN ACROSS CALIFORNIA. OUR PROPOSED AMENDMENTS IN ADDITION TO THE TIMELINE EXTENSION IS REALLY THINKING ABOUT HOW TO MITIGATE ANY IMPACT ON SMALL RURAL AND REMOTE SCHOOL DISTRICT CALIFORNIA WHO MAY NOT HAVE CREDENTIALED TEACHERS OR THE ABILITY TO CONVERT HALF THE PER AND INTO FORTY PROGRAMS. AND WE LOOK FOR TO WORKING WITH AUTHORS OFFICE TO ADDRESS SOME OF THESE ISSUES AND OTHERS THANK YOU. THANK YOU IS THERE ANY ADDITIONAL SUPPORT. ANY OPPOSITION TO THE BILL. SEEING AND HEARING MEN WILL COME BACK TO THE COMMITTEE. ANY QUESTIONS COMMENTS CONCERNS. ASSEMBLY WOMAN WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE OUT THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND I APPRECIATE ALL THE COMMENTS AND WE HAVE BEEN LOOKING INTO THE AREAS THAT HAVE BEEN MEANT TO MENTION TO THEIR THEIR GENERAL AREAS THAT CAN. EASILY BE ACCOMMODATED -- BUT WE DO BELIEVE THAT ALL DAY KINDERGARTEN AT LEAST AN OPTION AT MOST SCHOOLS IS IT NECESSARY OF KIND OF THING THAT WE NEED TO HAVE -- BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT IT HAS A POSITIVE EFFECT ON OUR CHILDREN PARTICULARLY THOSE WHO IN LOW INCOME NEIGHBORHOODS AND COMMUNITIES -- AND MOST OF OUR STUDENTS ARE READY FOR FULL DAY KINDERGARTEN BECAUSE THEY'VE ALREADY DONE ALMOST OF THEM FULL DAY PRE SCHOOL. AND BECAUSE ESPECIALLY WOOD WORKING FAMILIES AND SO WE RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YA VOTE ON THIS MATTER AND WILL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE OPPOSITION. THANK YOU SAM A MEMBER WEBER DO WE HAVE A MOTION FOR THE BILL. MOVED BY SENATOR CHIANG MADAM SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. ITEM FOUR AB LEYVA. LEYVA AYE WILK HI WILK I CHIANG.

WE ARE GOING TO GO TO ITEM FIFTEEN A. B.. NINE SIXTY SEVEN ASSEMBLYMEMBER BEGIN WHENEVER YOU'RE READY. GREAT GOOD MORNING MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME AT THIS HEARING THIS MORNING FOR THIS MEASURE. AB NINE SIX SEVEN INCLUDES CHARTER SCHOOL COMMUNITIES IN THE EL CAP PROCESS THE LOCAL CONTROL ACCOUNTABILITY PLAN PROCESS AND SUPPORTS THE LEGISLATURE AND GOVERNOR'S GOAL OF ALIGNING CHARTER SCHOOL TRANSPARENCY. AND ACCOUNTABILITY WITHOUT OF ALL STATE LOCAL EDUCATION AGENCIES. FIVE YEARS CALIFORNIA SCHOOLS HAVE BEEN TASKED WITH DEVELOPING DATA DRIVEN AND RIGOROUS LOCAL ENGAGEMENT AND MEANINGFUL STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT PROCESS SEES IN EL CAP DEVELOPMENT AND DELIVERY. THE LOCAL CONTROL FUNDING RECORD FORMULA REQUIRES THAT ELEAZAR CONSULT WITH PARENTS STUDENTS AND THE COMMUNITY AS THEY DEVELOP THEIR L. CAPS AND STUDIES HAVE DEMONSTRATED THAT SCHOOLS THAT HAVE MEANINGFUL ENGAGEMENT WITH THOSE COMMUNITIES. HAVE HAVE BEEN THE MOST SUCCESSFUL AT ELIMINATING THE ACHIEVEMENT GAP. DURING MY TENURE AS A SCHOOL BOARD MEMBER WE HAD AN EXTREMELY ROBUST EL CAP PROCESS. IN DOING SO WE WERE ABLE TO ENGAGE PARENTS AND STUDENTS AND STAFF IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF A USEFUL PLANNING TOOL. UNFORTUNATELY AT PRESENT NOT ALL PARENTS AND STUDENTS HAVE THE ABILITY AND MEANS TO ACCESS THEIR LOCAL SCHOOL BOARD LEADERSHIP AND GOVERNING STRUCTURES TO PARTICIPATE IN THIS IMPORTANT PROCESS. AB NINE SIX SEVEN BRINGS CHARTER SCHOOLS INTO ALIGNMENT WITH ALL CALIFORNIA PUBLIC SCHOOLS AND PROVIDES THE EL CAP AS A UNIFORM AND STANDARD BASIS OF COMPARISON TO MONITOR STUDENT OUTCOMES ACROSS THE EIGHT STATE PRIORITIES. AND ESPECIALLY AMONG TARGETED SUBGROUPS ACROSS ALL PUBLIC SCHOOLS. I AM CONFIDENT THAT THIS CONSISTENCY WILL LEAD TO GREATER COMMUNITY SUPPORT FOR ELLIE EIGHT AND CHARTER ENDEAVORS A CLEAR ROAD MAP FOR LEN CHARGER BUDGET PRIORITIES. AND AN ONGOING FOCUS ON IMPROVING OUTCOMES FOR ALL OF CALIFORNIA STUDENTS. WITH ME TODAY A RIGEL SPENCER MASSARO FROM PUBLIC ADVOCATES SPONSOR OF THE BILL AND ROBSON SWIFT A RECENT GRADUATE FROM WEST CONTRA COSTA UNIFIED. THANK YOU SIMPLY WOMAN -- TO WITNESSES TWO MINUTES EACH PLEASE. THE MORNING SENATORS RACHEL SPENCER MASSARO WITH PUBLIC ADVOCATES. AT TWO YEARS AGO CHARTER SCHOOL PARENTS AND RICHMOND -- REQUESTED A TRAINING ON THE EL CAP FOR CHARTER SCHOOLS THEY'D SEEN US DELIVER MANY SUCH TRAININGS TO DISTRICT PARENTS OVER THE YEARS THIS THIS TASK COVER PROVED MORE DIFFICULT THAN ANTICIPATED WE HAD A HARD TIME FINDING MANY OF THE CHARTER SCHOOL ALL CAPS. A SOMEWHERE IN DRAFT FORM AND OTHERS DIDN'T CONTAIN ALL OF THE SUPPLEMENTAL IN CONCENTRATION FUNDS GENERATED BY THE HIGH NEED STUDENTS IN THE CHARTER SCHOOL. AT THE TRAINING PARENTS DIDN'T UNDERSTAND WHY THE SCHOOLS HAD FEWER OR NO REQUIREMENTS RUN EL CAP ENGAGEMENT. TRANSPARENCY ACCOUNTABILITY AS COMPARED WITH THE DISTRICT COUNTERPARTS. AFTER THIS TRAINING PUBLIC ADVOCATES CONDUCTED AN ANALYSIS OF SEVENTY CHARTER SCHOOL -- CAMPS PUBLISHED IN AUGUST OF LAST YEAR. WE FOUND THAT ONE THIRD OF THE CHARTER SCHOOL EXAMINED HAD NO EL CAP ON LINE EVEN AFTER EMAIL REQUESTS TO THE SCHOOL WE WERE NOT ABLE TO OBTAIN THEM. OF THE ALL CAPS WE COULD FIND MORE THAN TWO THIRDS OF THE STATE FUNDS GENERATED BY HIGH NEED STUDENTS OVER THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS WAS UNACCOUNTED. FOR ONLY 20% CLEARLY MEASURED HOW THE ENGAGED PARENTS AND SCHOOL DECISION MAKING AND ONLY ENGAGEMENT HOW COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT HAD IMPACT THEIR COP. NOT POST THEIR CAPS IN A LANGUAGE OTHER THAN ENGLISH. AND NONE OF THE CHARTER SCHOOLS EXAMINED PROPERLY DOCUMENTED HOW THEY WERE INCREASING ARE IMPROVING I SERVICES FOR HIGH NEED STUDENTS AS A LAW REQUIRES. THREE GAUGE MEANT TRANSPARENCY ACCOUNTABILITY AB NINE SIXTY SEVEN WOULD ADDRESS THESE ISSUES BRING PARITY AND EQUITY TO THE CHARTER SCHOOL EL CAP PROCESS. THANK YOU. THANK YOU PLEASE PROCEED. GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS ROBIN SAID I JUST GRADUATED FROM DE ANZA HIGH SCHOOL IN WEST CONTRA COSTA UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT. AND I WAS AN EXECUTIVE MEMBER OF MY DISTRICTS. LOOK CONTROL ACCOUNTABILITY PARENT AND STUDENT COMMITTEE WHO CUT THAT ALLAH -- BECAUSE STUDENTS AT MY DISTRICT AND IN GENERAL I'M NOT HEARD IN DECISIONS THAT DIRECTLY IMPACT THEIR FUTURE. AND THEIR EDUCATION AND THIS IS ESPECIALLY TRUE OF THOSE STUDENTS THE AND DUPLICATED COUNT. I ALONG WITH PUBLIC ADVOCATE SUPPORT AB NINE SIX SEVEN BECAUSE I WANT STUDENTS AND PARENTS AND CHARTER SCHOOLS TO HAVE THE SAME OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE THEIR VOICES HEARD. I WENT TO THE FIRST MEET MEETING OF MY DL CAP COMMITTEE ABOUT TWO YEARS AGO. WHERE COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS AND PARENTS CAME TOGETHER TO HOLD THE DISTRICT ACCOUNTABLE AND TO IMPROVE OUR DISTRICTS SERVE OUR SCHOOLS? AND ONCE I SAW THAT I KNEW I WANTED TO JOIN ON THAT ALL CAP I WAS ABLE TO ORGANIZE MY FELLOW STUDENTS INTO A CAUCUS THAT VOTED IN ACTED TOGETHER. IN THIS WAY WE ARE ABLE TO SAFEGUARD STUDENT AS ENTRANCE AND EMPOWER STUDENTS TO SHARE THEIR OPINIONS AND WE'RE ABLE TO GET MANY RECOMMENDATIONS -- AT TO THE SCHOOL BOARD. BUT AS A COMMITTEE OVERALL WE HAD CHALLENGES WE HAVE LONG FIGHTS OF OUR BY LAWS WE HAD TROUBLE GETTING DATA THAT WE NEEDED FROM RECOMMENDATIONS TO MAKE COUNTS. CONFLICTS OVER TOWN HALLS BY NO MEANS IS THE EL CAP PROCESS PERFECT. BUT DESPITE THE CHALLENGES WE ARE ABLE TO HOLD THE DISTRICT ACCOUNTABLE FOR ITS DECISIONS AROUND THE BUDGET AND WE ARE ABLE TO ENGAGE THE DISTRICT AROUND THE BUDGET WHICH FORCED THEM TO BE TRANSPARENT AND HOW THEY FORMULATED THEIR DECISIONS. I CANNOT IMAGINE OUR DISTRICTS EL CAP WITHOUT THE COMMITTEE'S INVOLVEMENT AND THEIR WORK. THIS YEAR'S SUPPORTED BY COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS THE COMMITTEE DELIVERED CLEAR. I'LL CAP RECOMMENDATIONS TO THE DISTRICT INCLUDING INCREASED ACADEMICS APART FOR AFRICAN AMERICAN STUDENTS TO CLOSE THE AFRICAN AMERICAN. ACHIEVEMENT GAP IN OUR DISTRICT AND MANY OTHER PRO AND WE SUPPORT AND MANY OTHER PROGRAMS THAT. BENEFIT OUR STUDENTS. THE DISTRICT RESPOND IN A WRITING AS REQUIRED BY LAW. I'M NOT SURE HOW STUDENTS AND PARENTS IN CHARTER SCHOOLS MEAN PHILLY ENGAGE IN THE EL CAP PROCESS WITHOUT STAKEHOLDER COMMITTEES. THAT MEET THEM WITH THE MINISTRATION THROUGHOUT THE YEAR. AND I DO NOT KNOW HOW THEY GET EL CFF TRAINING ARE EL CAP TRAINING I DON'T KNOW HOW THEY ASK QUESTIONS AND I DON'T KNOW HOW THEY MAKE RECOMMENDATIONS. AS SADDENS ME THAT THE FIVE CHARTER SCHOOLS AND MY DISTRICT DON'T HAVE THE SAME OPPORTUNITY FOR STUDENTS AND PARENTS TO ADVOCATE FOR THEMSELVES AND HAVE. AGENCY AND HOW THEY'RE EDUCATED AND HOW THEIR CHILDREN ARE EDUCATED. THANK YOU. WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. LIZ BUT THAT'S OF ALL OF THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF SCHOOL BUSINESS OFFICIALS IN SUPPORT. CAITLYN JENNER ME AFTER THE SAN BENITO COUNTY JUST A GOV GETS A BETTER SCHOOLS AND SUPPORT. PAMELA GIVES REPRESENTING THE LOS ANGELES COUNTY OFFICE OF EDUCATION AND WE SUPPORT THE BILL. CARLOS MICHELLE WITH CALIFORNIA SCHOOL BOARDS ASSOCIATION IN SUPPORT. KATHY SURE FOR THE ACLU OF CALIFORNIA IN SUPPORT. THE INJURY ON THE OF THE SAN FRANCISCO UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT IN SUPPORT. I PATRICK FORTY WITH FIGHT CRIME INVEST IN KIDS AND READY NATION AND MORE IN SUPPORT. GOOD MORNING MARK OUT OF ITS ON BEHALF BEHALF OF THE ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA SCHOOL ADMINISTRATORS RATIONALE SUPPORTIVE I'M IN THE POSITION ON THE BILL WOULD WORKING WITH THE AUTHORS OFFICE WE SUPPORT. ALL OF THE PUSH ON THE BILL THE ONLY CONCERN WE HAVE IS ABOUT THE IMPACT THE WOULD HAPPEN CHARTER SCHOOL AUTHORIZED RESPECT PARTICULAR SCHOOL DISTRICTS. OUT WHEN HE COMES TO YOU IN THE L. CAPS WE BELIEVE THAT THEY DON'T HAVE THE STAFFING OR THE FUNDING TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT ADDITIONAL OVERSIGHT. OF REVIEWING ALL CAPS BUT WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE AUTHOR TO MITIGATE THOSE CONCERNS THANK YOU. THANK YOU ADDITIONAL WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. ANSWER ANY OPPOSITION TO THE BILL. TWO WITNESSES TWO MINUTES EACH BEGIN WHEN YOU'RE READY. GOOD MORNING I'M CALLING MILLER THE CALIFORNIA CHARTER SCHOOLS ASSOCIATION WHERE UNFORTUNATELY OPPOSE THIS BILL -- I WOULD NOTE THAT -- THE EDUCATION TRAILER BILL THAT YOU'LL BE -- CONSIDERING DOES ADDRESS ON ALL THE ISSUES AROUND TRANSPARENCY THEY'RE INCLUDED IN THS BILL A WE DO SUPPORT -- INCREASE TRANSPARENCY IN MAKING SURE THAT TURNER SCHOOLS ARE ENGAGING THEIR COMMUNITIES IN THE IN THESE PROCESSES -- THE EL CAP IS AN EVOLVING PROCESS IS YOUR YOUR OWN STAFF ANALYSIS NOTES THERE A LOT OF ISSUES WITH DISTRICTS IN TERMS OF HOW THEY'RE ENGAGING THEIR COMMUNITIES AS WELL. SO WE THINK THAT ADDING CHARTER SCHOOLS TO ALL THOSE LAWS AND VERY PRESCRIPTIVE PROCESSES -- THAT DISTRICTS ARE APPLYING ARE REALLY NOT A SOLUTION TO THIS ISSUE OF IN OUR COURAGE IN MORE -- BORN GAUGE WENT -- THE JOINT LEGISLATIVE AUDIT COMMITTEE HAS ALSO RECENTLY -- GOOD CONTRACTED TO OF THE BSA FOR AN EVALUATION OF THIS ISSUE AS WELL -- PUBLIC ADVOCATE'S REPORT DID NOT INCLUDE DISTRICTS SO WE DON'T KNOW HOW OF PERVASIVE THESE ISSUES ARE AT THE DISTRICT LEVEL AS WELL -- BUT WE DO BELIEVE THAT -- IN ADDITION TO YOUR OWN -- AS BE ONE TWENTY SIX THE TRANSPARENCY ISSUES IN CHARTER SCHOOLS ARE IMPROVING -- THIS BILL WE THINK IT JUST GOES TOO FAR IN TERMS OF CREATING SOME VERY PRESCRIPTIVE -- REQUIREMENTS ON CHARTER SCHOOLS THAT HAVEN'T YET BEEN -- BEEN -- PROVEN TO BE EFFECTIVE -- ALSO JUST TO BE CLEAR CHARTER SCHOOLS ARE DIFFERENT THAN SCHOOL DISTRICTS THEIR SCHOOL LEVEL ACCOUNTABILITY -- THERE ALSO HAVE BEEN DOING ACCOUNTABILITY BASED ON GOALS AND OUTCOMES FOR FOR MANY MANY YEARS THE CAP ADDED ON TO THAT PROCESS. THE BIGGEST CONCERN WITH THIS BILL AS IT ACTUALLY ELIMINATES THE THE SECTION OF LAW THAT WOULD INCLUDE CHARTER SCHOOLS -- THAT THAT REQUIRE CHARTER SCHOOLS TO ALIGN THEIR CHARTERS WITH THEIR ALL CAPS BY LIMITING THAT SECTION LOG COMPLETELY. IGNORES THE FACT THAT CHARTER SCHOOLS ARE ALREADY DOING THIS KIND OF ACCOUNTABILITY THROUGH THEIR CHARTER PROCESS. THAT ARE APPROVED BY THEIR DISTRICTS AND AND AND OUR LOCAL BASED ACCOUNTABILITY SO SO WE WE REALLY ARE CONCERNED ABOUT THE ELIMINATION OF THAT THAT CONNECTION BETWEEN THE CHARTER AND THE ALL CAP IN THIS BILL. YOUR NEXT WITNESS HELLO HALLERAN WITH THE CHARTER SCHOOLS DEVELOPMENT CENTER SO I ECHO EVERYTHING THAT MY COLLEAGUE SAID IN ADDITION I JUST REALLY WANT TO EMPHASIZETHE FACT. THAT PRIMARILY CHARTER SCHOOLS ARE BEHOLDEN TO THEIR CHARTER AND THAT CHARTER HAS ALL SORTS OF PUBLIC HEARINGS AND TIME FOR INPUT. THAT'S THE DOCUMENTS THAT CHARTER SCHOOLS ARE BEHOLDEN TO UNLIKE TRADITIONAL PUBLIC SCHOOLS SO WHEN WE ADD ON ANOTHER DOCUMENT THAT IS DIFFERENT IN LOTS OF WAYS FROM THE CHARTER DOCUMENT. IT DOES LEAD TO SOME CONFUSION AS TO WHAT DOCUMENT REALLY CHARTER SCHOOLS ARE BEHOLDEN TO AND IF THE EL CAP CHANGES -- THE THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE CHARTER TRADITIONAL SCHOOLS DON'T GO THROUGH THAT PUBLIC HEARING PROCESS OR WRITE A CHARTER SO IT'S IT NEEDS TO BE REALLY CLEAR AND AND WHEN THE ORIGINAL EL CAP -- LEGISLATION WAS WRITTEN IT TALKED ABOUT THE FACT THAT -- THAT IT LOOKS TO THE CHARTER DIFFERENTLY THAN TRADITIONAL SCHOOLS IN TERMS OF PRESENTING THAT AL CAPP DOCUMENT. SO -- I I JUST THINK WE NEED TO WE NEED TO RECOGNIZE THAT I THINK THAT THIS THIS PARTICULAR BILL FAILS TO RECOGNIZE THAT. A CHARTER SCHOOLS DO -- CAPS NOW THEY JUST DON'T HAVE THIS MORE ELABORATE PROCESS. THANK YOU FOR CLARIFYING THAT BECAUSE I WAS GOING TO SAY SCOTT HER SCHOOLS ALREADY DO YOU HAVE TO DO AN EL CAP I THINK WITH THIS BILLS TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH IS MAKING SURE THEY'RE ACTUALLY GETTING DONE. AS WE HEARD THAT SO MANY OF THEM ARE BEING DONE SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH ADDITIONAL WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. SEEING NONE WILL BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE QUESTIONS COMMENTS CONCERNS. ALL RIGHT WOULD YOU LIKE TO COOK. I SEVEN WILK I'M USED TO HAVING DOCTOR PAN THERE SO. AND THOSE YOU SAID IN HERE EVERY WEEK KNOW THAT -- COM AND THEN MAYBE MAYBE QUESTIONS COULD BE IN THIS SO -- FOR ME CHARTER SCHOOLS ARE LIGHT DIFFERENT BECOMES. THE FOCUS ON HOW COME BASS AND AS MENTIONED -- BY THE OPPONENTS THAT'S ALL DONE TO THE CHURCH THROUGH THE CHARTING PROCESS AND SEEMS TO ME THAT WE'RE TRYING. TO TAKE -- WHAT'S OUTCOME BASE AND AND TRY TO MAKE IT RULES BASE WHICH IS. REALLY PART OF PROBABLY THE GENERAL EDUCATION SYSTEM I MEAN I THINK WE GOT GREAT TEACHERS ADMINISTRATORS CLASSIFIED COMMITTED WITH A SCHOOL BOARD MEMBERS. THE CHALLENGE THAT WE HAVE. IT IS JUST A STEPPING THE I DON'T KNOW WHAT WE DO ABOUT IT IT'S ONE SIZE. ONE SIZE FITS ALL YOU KNOW TOP DOWN DRIVEN. AND I DON'T THINK IT'S NECESSARILY BENEFITING -- OUR OUR STUDENTS IN A WORLD WHERE THEY DON'T HAVE TO NOW NO ONE THING THEY HAVE TO BE PREPARED FOR ANYTHING. AND IT'S A REAL CHALLENGE AND I THINK YOU KNOW THERE'S A LOT OF DIVERSITY IN CHARTER SCHOOLS AND I LIKE TO SEE CHARTER SCHOOLS CONTINUE TO PROSPER. I ALSO LIKE TO SEE A REGULAR SCHOOLS DO DO BETTER. SOMEONE I WAS READING THE BILL ARCHER I JUST HAD AN EPIPHANY AND SO WHAT THROUGH IT OUT THERE NOT FOR NOW BUT FOR NEXT YEAR AND I'D LOVE TO WORK WITH YOU ON IT BECAUSE I THINK OU. ARE UNIQUELY POSITIONED TO DO IT BASED UPON YOUR YOUR EXPERIENCE. MAYBE INSTEAD OF TRYING TO MAKE CHARTER SCHOOLS MORE LIKE REGULAR SCHOOLS MAYBE WE SHOULD MAKE GREATER SCHOOLS MORE LIKE CHARTER SCHOOLS AND MAYBE WE COULD SIT DOWN. AND TRY TO COME UP WITH THINGS THAT HELP REGULAR SCHOOLS. THAT MAKES THE THE BECAUSE I HEAR A LOT THAT THE PLAYING FIELD IS NOT LEVEL MAYBE THERE'S THINGS THAT WE COULD DO THAT WOULD MAKE THE SCHOOL DISTRICTS FEEL LIKE YOU KNOW. THEY CAN BE MORE COMPETITIVE AND ULTIMATELY I THINK THAT HELPS STUDENTS SO I CAN'T I CAN'T BE WITH YOU ON THIS BILL TODAY I DON'T THINK IT'S THE RIGHT APPROACH. BUT I KNOW YOU'RE COMMITTED. TO FIND EDUCATION FIRM FOR EVERY STUDENT AND I'M INTERESTED IN INTERESTED IN WORKING WITH YOU IF YOU ARE. NEXT YEAR ON THINGS. THAT RELIEVES THE REGULATORY BURDEN WHEN APPROPRIATE ON REGULAR SCHOOLS -- THANK YOU SENATOR WILK ASSEMBLY WOMAN LIKE CLUBS I'M SURE I I'D ACTUALLY LOVE TO ADDRESS AND MY MY OVERLAPPING SENATORS CONCERNS IN THIS MATTER. I I APPRECIATE THAT AND THE REASON THAT I WAS VERY WILLING AND EXCITED TO SPONSOR THIS BILL IS IT IS BECAUSE EXACTLY THIS KIND OF STANDARDIZED REPORTING. THAT ALLOWS US TO GET TO THOSE CONVERSATIONS BECAUSE THE NEXT IMPORTANT PIECE MOVING BEYOND MEASURES THAT ARE GONNA BE COMING BEFORE THIS BODY IN A FEW WEEKS ON CHARTER SCHOOL TRANSPARENCY. IS HOW DO WE HAVE ANY STANDARD MEASURE OF LOOKING AND EFFECTIVE OUTCOMES. THIS LEVEL OF REGULATION FOR LACK OF A BETTER WORD BUT IT IS SIMPLY A REPORTS THAT EVERY CALIFORNIA PUBLIC SCHOOL IS REQUIRED TO DO HOW ARE YOU SPENDING TAXPAYER MONEY STATE RESOURCES. IN SUPPORT OF THE EIGHT STATE PRIORITIES SPECIFICALLY AIMED AT CLOSING THE ACHIEVEMENT GAP CHARTERS ARE IN FACT OUTCOME BASED. OUTCOME DID DRIVEN DATA AND A PROCESS FOR ENGAGING PARENTS SUPPORTING AND PROVIDING AN EL CAP THAT IS ACCOUNTABLE AND AND VISIBLE TO THE PUBLIC SHOULDN'T BE PROBLEMATIC AT ALL. IT SHOULD BE A MEASURE OF THE WORK THAT THEY'RE ALREADY DOING AND IN SO DOING IT ALLOWS US TO TAKE THAT STANDARDIZED DOCUMENT ACROSS ALL STATE ELEAZAR AND THE CHARTER SCHOOL COMMUNITY. THAT ALONG WITH DASHBOARD DATA COMPARE THOSE TO AND FIND OUT WHAT IS GETTING US THE MOST BANG FOR OUR BUCK IN PUBLIC EDUCATION DOLLARS REGARDLESS OF THE KIND OF EDUCATIONAL ENVIRONMENT IT'S HAPPENING IN. AND SO PART OF THIS IS TO ESTABLISH A COMMON SET OF DATA AND THEN WE ARE ABLE TO MOVE ON AND HAVE THOSE CONVERSATIONS WHICH I'D BE MORE THAN HAPPY TO HAVE WITH YOU IN THE FUTURE -- YOU KNOW IN LIGHT OF THAT I I WOULD RESPECTFULLY REQUEST DRIVE OUT THANK YOU. ASSEMBLY WOMAN WE HAVE A MOTION ONE MORE CALL THAT'S WHAT WOULD GO GO RIGHT AHEAD. I THINK I THINK THE POOREST REACHED CHARTER SCHOOLS AND REGULAR SCHOOLS IS. THAT THEY ARE HELD ACCOUNTABLE BECAUSE THEY'RE ACTUALLY IN THE MARKET SO IF YOU ARE STUDENT IN YOUR IN A FAILING SCHOOL AT REGULAR PUBLIC SCHOOL. YOU ARE MOST LIKELY STOCK WHEREAS IF YOU'RE IN A CHARTER SCHOOL YOU AT THE STUDENT PARKING ASIDE THIS DOES NOT WORK FOR ME AND WE GO BACK SO I THINK THERE'S MORE COUNT ABILITY IN THAT PARTICULAR SYSTEM BECAUSE IT'S MORE MARKET BASED STAND IN THE GENERAL. POPULATION WITH THE EXCEPTION THAT I DON'T THINK THAT WE'VE MOVED TO THE PERSPECTIVE THAT WE ARE IN A FREE MARKET ECONOMY AND EDUCATION EDUCATION IS A PUBLIC GOOD.

THIS BILL WILL REQUIRE PUBLIC COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES TO DESIGNATE A SPECIFIC AND VOTER EMPOWERMENT COORDINATOR ON EACH CAMPUS WILL BE TASKED WITH DEVELOPING A PLAN TO INCREASE CIVIC ENGAGEMENT AND DEMOCRATIC PARTICIPATION. AVAILABLE DATA SHOWS THAT WHEN COLLEGE CAMPUSES DIVERT RESOURCES INTO DEVELOPING A PLAN FOCUSED ON CIVIC AND VOTER EMPOWERMENT. IT RESLTS IN STRONG VOTER TURNOUT FOR EXAMPLE AT UCLA WHICH VOLUNTARILY TAKES PART IN THE ALL IN CAMPUS DEMOCRACY CHALLENGE WHICH ARE BILL IS PARTLY MODELED ON AFTER PARTICIPATING IN THE PROGRAM UCLA REPORTED A FIVE HUNDRED AND IN PERSON STUDENT VOTERS DURING THE TWENTY EIGHT MID TERMS COMPARED TO TWENTY FOURTEEN EVEN GIVEN THE THE HUGE INCREASE IN TWENTY FOURTEEN TO TWENTY EIGHTEEN GENERALLY THAT'S PRETTY INCREDIBLE. THERE AN ESTIMATED THREE POINT ONE MILLION STUDENTS THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA'S HUNDRED AND FORTY SEVEN PUBLIC UNIVERSITIES AND COLLEGES UNIVERSITIES CAN AND SHOULD PLAY A PIVOTAL ROLE IN ENCOURAGING CIVIC ENGAGEMENT. AND INVOLVING OUR YOUNG PEOPLE IN OUR DEMOCRACY RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT FOR THE STUDENTS CIVIC IN VOTER ENGAGEMENT TACT. AND IN PLEASED TO INTRODUCE TO SUPPORTERS HERE TODAY TO TESTIFY GOT DOWN TO THE JACKSON FROM THE IN THE LACI P. AND JULIE FORESIGHT FRIEND AT THE END OF VOTERS. THANK YOU WELCOME TO WITNESSES TWO MINUTES EACH LA YOU DECIDE WHO GOES FIRST. IF IT'S OKAY I THINK OF SENATORS -- AWESOME HELLO MY NAME IS JOHN TO JACKSON -- I'M A THIRTY A MAJOR. NOW IN THE FOURTH YEAR MAJOR THE YEAR JUST ENDED AT CSU FRESNO MAJORING IN PSYCHOLOGY IN DOUBLE MINORING IN CRIMINOLOGY IN POLITICAL SCIENCE. I'M THE NEWLY ELECTED VICE PRESIDENT AND CO MEMBERSHIP CHAIR OF THE FRESNO STATE CHAPTER OF THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION FOR THE ADVANCEMENT OF COLORED PEOPLE -- ALSO KNOWN AS THE END OF THE C. P. AS WELL AS ONE OF TWENTY NATIONAL CIVIC ENGAGEMENT TRAINERS FOR THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION. I'M ALSO HERE REPRESENTING STUDENTS AT FRESNO STATE AND I AM SO GRATEFUL TO BE JOINED HERE TODAY BY ELIZABETH RUSSIA'S UNITA AND THE CROWD -- SHE'S A NEWLY ELECTED VICE PRESIDENT OF EXTERNAL AFFAIRS FOR MY STUDENT BODY GOVERNMENT ON CAMPUS. AND I AM A STUDENT AT END -- I IS A STUDENT AND A MEMBER OF MY CAMPUS AND W. C. P. WITH THE SPORT SUPPORT OF OUR INABILITY PEAS -- STATE PRESIDENT ALICE HOFFMAN STRONG SUPPORT AB. NINE SIXTY THREE MY GENERATION HAS NOT BEEN PROPERLY PREPARED TO COMPLETELY AND COP AND CONCISELY NAVIGATE OUR GREAT NATION'S CIVIC ENGAGEMENT PROCESS. THIS IS NO FAULT OF OUR OWN WE SPEND FOUR YEARS IN HIGH SCHOOL AND GOVERNMENT IS ONLY REQUIRED FOR ONE SEMESTER. THIS IS A RESULT IN HUGE IN A HUGE NUMBER OF COLLEGE STUDENTS LIKE ME WHO ENTERED ADULTHOOD AN EDUCATED ABOUT CIVIC ENGAGEMENT AND CIVIC DUTY. I KNOW WHERE THE POWER OF OUR VOICE TO VOTING AND THE IMPORTANCE INTANGIBILITY OF THEIR INVOLVEMENT WITH IN OUR SOCIO POLITICAL SYSTEMS. I AM GRATEFUL TO BE ONE OF TWENTY NATIONAL SEVEN GAVE AND TRAINERS FOR THE END OF A C. P.. SPECIFICALLY MY EXPERIENCES HAVE TAUGHT ME IN THIS ROLE -- MY EXPERIENCES IN THIS ROLE HAVE TAUGHT METHAT STUDENTS AT FRESNO STATE ARE HUNGRY FOR CHANGE THAT STUDENTS WITHIN THE CSU SYSTEM ARE THIRSTY FOR CIVIC SUPPORT AND EDUCATION. STUDENTS PURSUING HIGHER EDUCATION THROUGHOUT OUR STATE OUR NATION ARE ACHING FOR GUIDANCE AND A MORE UNIFORM SYSTEM BUT ARE UNAWARE OF HOW TO MAKE THIS POSSIBLE. THIS BILL WOULD BE A STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION. THE STATUS QUO OF ACADEMIA HAS CHARLIE TAUGHT STUDENTS ABOUT HOW OUR POLITICAL SYSTEM WORKS BUT NOT ABOUT THE CIVIC WE ENGAGE VOTERS AND THE GRASSROOTS ORGANIZER TO MAKE THE SYSTEMS WORK. IN TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN ONLY EIGHT POINT 2% OF OUR YOUNG VOTERS TURNED OUT WE WERE ABLE TO SEE A TWENTY POINT INCREASE IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN AND WITH THE HELP OF THIS BILL WE HOPE TO SEE MORE OF AN INCREASE GOING FORWARD -- I WILL CONTINUE TO TO PUSH ON BUT I WOULD JUST LIKE TO CLOSE IN SAYING THAT AS A COLLEGE STUDENT AND ON BEHALF OF THE END OF A C. P.. AS WELL OF AS WELL AS MY A. S. I. OUR STUDENT BODY GOVERNMENT OUT FRESNO STATE -- WE WOULD REALLY ENCOURAGE YOU TO FULLY SUPPORT EIGHTY NINE SIXTY THREE THANK YOU SO MUCH THANK YOU VERY MUCH NEXT WITNESS I I MY NAME IS JOEY FOR SIDE THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR LISTENING TO ME TODAY -- I AM ONE OF THE SPONSORS ON THIS BILL I'M AN ARTIST A FILMMAKER I'M ALSO THE FOUNDER OF A BAND OF VOTERS. A NONPROFIT NONPARTISAN ORGANIZATION THAT PARTNERS WITH STUDENT LEADERS -- TO AND COMMUNITY COLLEGES AND STATE UNIVERSITIES TO HELP THEIR PEERS BECOME ACTIVE PARTICIPANTS IN THEIR DEMOCRACY. IN A TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN AS WE KNOW TO A 52% OF COLLEGE STUDENTS REGISTERED ONLY 8% VOTED ONE OF THE WORST RATES IN THE COUNTRY. WELL MAJOR EFFORTS HAVE BEEN MADE TO REGISTER VOTERS IS CLEARLY NOT ENOUGH TO GET THEM TO THE BALLOT BOX. IN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN I CREATED AN INTERACTIVE ART INSTALLATION ABOUT VOTING IT WAS SEEM OVER FIFTY THOUSAND PEOPLE AND I HAD DIRECT CONVERSATIONS WITH UNDREDS OF YOUNG PEOPLE MANY OF THEM LOW INCOME YOUNG PEOPLE. ABOUT WHY THEY DIDN'T VOTE COUNTRY WHAT MANY PEOPLE THINK I LEARN THESE YOUNG PEOPLE WANT TO VOTE. WHAT WAS HEART BREAKING IS THAT THEY WERE OFTEN ASHAMED TO ADMIT THAT THEY DIDN'T KNOW HOW HOW THE GOVERNMENT WORKS HOW TO FIND NONPARTISAN INFORMATION HOW TO VOTE BY MAIL AT CETERA? MANY THOUGHT IT WAS THEIR FAULT. THIS IS OUR FAULT. IN A RECENT STUDY CALIFORNIA RANKED THIRTY EIGHTH IN A P. A P. CIVICS EXAM. IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN WE APPROACHED OVER TWENTY FIVE COLLEGES OFFERING A GRANT OF TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS EACH. TO GIVE TO STUDENT LEADERS TO HOLD EDUCATION EVENTS IT HAD TO BE NON PARTISAN OFFER FREE FOOD AND HELP EDUCATE AND INFORM STUDENTS DURING THE LAST WEEKS OF THE ELECTION. WHEN WE CONTACTED VARIOUS DEPARTMENTS OF THESE UNITS OF THESE COLLEGES NO ONE KNEW WHERE TO SEND US WITH NO ONE IN CHARGE ONLY EIGHT COLLEGES PARTICIPATED AFTER TWO MONTHS OF REPEATED OUTRAGE? AND YET DURING THE TWENTY TWO EVENTS WE SUPPORTED WE FOUND STUDENTS EAGER TO VOTE AND EMPOWERED BY THE KNOWLEDGE OF THE GAME. MY HUSBAND WAS THE DEAN OF THE ARTS PROGRAM AT PASADENA CITY COLLEGE I KNOW HOW HARD FACULTY AND ADMINISTRATION WORK THAT'S WHY WE'RE ASKING FOR A FUNDED PERMANENT PART TIME POSITION. WHAT WE ALSO KNOW IS THAT WHEN STUDENT LEADERS ARE INVOLVED IN PLANNING AND HOSTING EVENTS THEY SUCCEED OF THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER TESTIFIED ABOUT UCLA AND I CAN TESTIFY ABOUT DION'S WORK? AT THIS TIME IN PARTICULAR WITH THE VOTERS CHOICE ACT THE CENSUS AND THE EARLY PRIMARIES THERE'S MUCH FOR STUDENTS TO LEARN AND THEY ARE OFTEN THE ONES TO TEACH THEIR FAMILIES. WE ARE ALSO VERY EXCITED THAT THIS BILL IS TO FULL TIME POSITIONS TO THE SECRETARY OF STATE'S OFFICE SO THEY CAN EXPAND THEIR OWN VERY IMPORTANT STUDENT VOTE PROJECT. AT LESS THAN SIXTY FIVE CENTS PER STUDENT WE HOPE YOU'LLAGREE IT'S A SMALL PRICE TO PAY FOR FULL TIME VOTERS AYE WILK I WILL END HERE. BUT TO SAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR LISTENING TO US. I HOPE YOU'LL SUPPORT OUR BILL VERY GOOD JOB THANK YOU WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. IF SOMEONE THE LONG ON BEHALF OF SECRETARIES DAY ALEX BUT THE AND SUPPORT THANK YOU. THANK YOU.

THANK YOU SIMPLY WOMAN THE BILL HAS BEEN MOVED BY SENATOR DORADO MADAM SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL.

JUST AFTER ASSEMBLY WOMAN PETRIE-NORRIS OR WE WOULD HAVE STARTED WITH YOU. YOU HAVE TO BILLS WOULD YOU LIKE TO START WITH FILE ITEM. SIX WHICH PHONE NUMBERS THAT ARE THAT IS THREE OH TWO WOULD BE HAPPY TO VERY GOOD. I'M SURE AND I ALWAYS ENJOY HEARING ABOUT WAYS THAT WE'RE GONNA HELP YOUNG PEOPLE VOTE SO I WAS HAPPY. TO SIT THROUGH THAT PRESENTATION VERY GOOD AND BEFORE YOU GET STARTED I JUST WANT TO THANK YOU FOR YOUR DILIGENT WORK WITH THIS COMMITTEE ON THIS BILL I KNOW IT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO YOU AND ALL OF US. AND I APPRECIATE YOU WORKING WITH THE COMMITTEE THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND AND I APPRECIATE WORKING WITH THE COMMITTEE AS WELL AND AND WITH YOU -- WE ALL SEE EVIDENCE OF THE HOUSING AND HOMELESSNESS CRISIS IN OUR COMMUNITIES EVERY DAY. WHETHER IT WAS THE HEPATITIS A OUTBREAK IN SAN DIEGO WHICH KILLED TWENTY PEOPLE AND INJURED. SIX HUNDRED THE TENT CITIES THAT ARE GROWING THROUGHOUT LOS ANGELES THE HOMELESS PEOPLE WE INTERACT WITH JUST ACROSS THE STREET FROM THE CAPITOL HERE IN SACRAMENTO. FOR MY DISTRICT THE ROWS OF OUR VIS THAT LINE EL CAMINO RIEL ON THE BORDER OF STANFORD UNIVERSITY. WE TALK ABOUT HOW IT'S IMPACTING A WORKING POOR OR A RETIREES. BUT UNTIL RECENTLY WE DIDN'T REALIZE TO WHAT EXTENT HOMELESSNESS WAS IMPACTING A VERY DIFFERENT GROUP OF CALIFORNIANS. WHICH IS OUR COLLEGE STUDENTS. HOUSING AND FOOD AND SECURITY AMONG COLLEGE STUDENTS ALSO KNOWN AS BASIC NEEDS AND SECURITY IS FINALLY GETTING THE ATTENTION IT DESERVES. STUDENTS OF COLOR FIRST GENERATION COLLEGE STUDENTS FINANCIAL AID RECIPIENTS AND FORMER FOSTER YOUTH ARE AT MUCH HIGHER RISK OF EXPERIENCING BASIC NEEDS AND SECURITY. A RECENT REPORT RELEASED BY THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE AND THE HOPE CENTER FOR COLLEGE COMMUNITY AND JUSTICE WHICH SURVEYED NEARLY FORTY THOUSAND STUDENTS AT FIFTY SEVEN COMMUNITY COLLEGES. FOUND THAT 19% OF RESPONDENTS EXPERIENCED HOMELESSNESS IN THE PRIOR YEAR. IF YOU EXTRAPOLATE THAT THE CALIFORNIA'S COMMUNITY COLLEGE POPULATION OF TWO POINT ONE MILLION STUDENTS THIS MEANS THAT ALMOST FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND STUDENTS STATEWIDE HAVE EXPERIENCED HOMELESSNESS. IN THE LAST TWELVE MONTHS. THIS NUMBER IS NOT ONLY SHOCKING ALARMING AND TRAGIC BUT IT MUST BE A CALL TO ACTION. I INTRODUCED AB THREE OR TWO AFTER HEARING FROM MY FORMER DISTRICT OFFICE INTERN WHO SHARE WITH ME HER FRIENDS EXPERIENCE WITH HOMELESSNESS. AB THREE WHICH WOULD REQUIRE COMMUNITY COLLEGES TO PROVIDE A SAFE PARKING LOT ON CAMPUS FOR THE HOMELESS STUDENTS TO SLEEP IN THEIR VEHICLES. EXISTING LAW ALREADY REQUIRES COMMUNITY COLLEGES TO GRANT HOMELESS STUDENTS ACCESS TO CAMPUS OUR FACILITIES. AB THREE OH TWO IS THE NEXT STEP IN HELPING THIS GROWING POPULATION. UNDER AB THREE OR TWO EACH COMMUNITY COLLEGE DISTRICT WILL BE PROVIDED BROAD FLEXIBILITY TO DEVELOP AN IMPLEMENTATION PLAN THAT MEETS THEIR LOCAL NEEDS AND CIRCUMSTANCES. AB THREE OR TWO ALSO IMPORTANTLY SPECIFIES THAT IT IS THE INTENT OF THE LEGISLATURE THAT HOMELESS STUDENTS WHO USE THE OVERNIGHT PARKING FACILITIES. CONNECTED TO AVAILABLE STATE COUNTY COMMUNITY COLLEGE DISTRICT AND COMMUNITY BASED HOUSING FOOD AND FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE RESOURCES. LET ME BE CLEAR. AB THREE OR TWO IS NOTHING TO CELEBRATE [inaudible] IT'S SAD. THE FACT THAT WE'RE EVEN ISCUSSING THIS IS A REFLECTION OF CALIFORNIA'S FAILURE OVER THE LAST THIRTY YEARS TO BUILD A HOUSING NECESSARY TO MEET THE NEEDS OF OUR GROWING POPULATION. BUT WE CAN'T LOOK AWAY OR AVOID THIS ISSUE JUST BECAUSE IT MAKES US FEEL AWKWARD. THE REALITY IS THAT STUDENTS ARE SLEEPING IN THEIR VEHICLES OR EVEN OUT ON THE STREET. TONIGHT. AND WHEN WE DON'T TO PROVIDE A SAFE PLACE FOR THEM TO SLEEP. WITH A MOAN AND OPPOSE A SHORT TERM SOLUTION LIKE SAFE LOTS BECAUSE WE SAY WE'RE WORKING TOWARDS THE LONGER TERM SOLUTION OF BUILDING HOUSINGFOR THEM. AND THREE TO FIVE YEARS. WE FORCE THEM INTO THE SHADOWS. IN THE DARK ALLEYS AND INDUSTRIAL PARKS WHERE THE STUDENTS ARE MOST VULNERABLE. AS I MENTIONED I I WANNA THINK THE CHAIR IN HER COMMITTEE STAFF -- FOR WORKING WITH MY STAFF AND ME ON THIS BILL. I APPRECIATE OUR CONVERSATIONS AND BELIEVE THAT AB THREE OR TWO WITH THE PROPOSED COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS IS A CRITICAL FIRST STEP TO TAKING STATEWIDE ACTION. TO ADDRESS THE HOMELESSNESS CRISIS THAT MANY OF OUR COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENTS FACE. I'LL BE ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEES AMENDMENTS WHICH INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING KEY COMPONENTS. ADDING A MINIMUM NUMBER OF UNITS THAT A STUDENT MUST BE ENROLLED IN TO USE THE OVERNIGHT PARKING FACILITIES. ADDING A SUNSET DATE OF DECEMBER THIRTY FIRST TWO THOUSAND TWENTY TWO WITH REPORTING. AND ADDING AN OPT OUT FROM THE BILL'S PROVISIONS FOR COMMUNITY COLLEGES WHO IMPLEMENTS BEST THE SPECIFIED HOUSING ASSISTANCE ACTIVITIES FOR STUDENTS WERE EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS. I ALSO WANT TO BE SURE TO RECOGNIZE THAT THIS BILL IS A DOS WANNA BE SURE TO RECOGNIZE AND ACKNOWLEDGE. THAT THIS BILL IS ASKING COMMUNITY COLLEGES TO DO MORE THAN THEY EVER HAVE HAD TO IN THE PAST. BUT WE'RE AT A SITUATION IN CALIFORNIA WHERE WE ALL HAVE TO DO MORE THAN WE EVER HAVE IN THE PAST. ONE OF MY LOCAL COMMUNITY COLLEGES FOR HILL HOW THE HOMELESSNESS SUMMIT THIS PAST FRIDAY. AND I REALLY WISH EVERYONE COULD HAVE BEEN THERE TO HEAR THE TESTIMONIALS FROM STUDENTS WHO EXPERIENCED HOMELESSNESS WHAT GOING TO COMMUNITY COLLEGE INCLUDING TO HEAR TODAY -- THE THE STUDENTS ARE MILITARY VETERANS THEIR FOSTER YOUTH THE LGBT Q. YOUTH AND AND AND OTHER SITUATIONS THAT THAT THEY'VE GONE THROUGH GROWING UP. THEY ARE SO STRONG AND SO PASSIONATE ABOUT GETTING AN EDUCATION AND HAVING A BRIGHTER FUTURE. AND IT WAS AMAZING TO SEE THE TURN OUT FROM THE COLLEGE'S FACULTY AND STAFF. INCLUDING THE SCHOOL'S PRESIDENT AND A FEW DISTRICT BOARD MEMBERS WHO WORKS SO HARD EVERY DAY TO HELP THEIR STUDENTS. I REALLY WANT TO ENCOURAGE EVERY COLLEGE ACROSS CALIFORNIA TO HOLD THIS TYPE OF AN EVENT. TO LISTEN TO YOUR STUDENTS AND A DE STIGMATIZE THE ISSUE OF STUDENT HOMELESSNESS. AND HEAR ABOUT WHAT THEY CAN DO TO HELP THEIR HOME THE STUDENT POPULATION. SORT OF INCLUDED AB THREE OR TWO IS NOT A SOLUTION TO THE HOMELESSNESS CRISIS. BUILDING MORE HOUSING IS. BUT THAT WLL TAKE YEARS AND BILLIONS OF DOLLARS. AND IN THE MEANTIME THERE ARE HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENTS EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS RIGHT NOW [inaudible] TONIGHT. AND WE SHOULD DO EVERYTHING WE CAN TO MAKE THEIR SITUATION A LITTLE BETTER. I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE -- AND I'M HONORED TO BE JOINED BY TWO COURAGEOUS COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENTS WHO TRAVEL TO BE HERE TODAY TO SHARE THEIR STORY AND EXPERIENCE. I'VE MATTHEW BOTO STUDENT AT FOOTHILL COLLEGE IN MY DISTRICT WHOSE EXPERIENCE LED TO THE INTRODUCTION OF THE BILL. AND ANTHONY WHITE THE SECOND A VETERAN AND STUDENT AT PALOMAR PALOMAR COLLEGE IN SAN DIEGO COUNTY AND AND BOTH OF THESE STUDENTS HAVE BECOME LEADERS IN THE STATE -- IN IN RAISING UP THESE ISSUES AND TRYING TO FIND CONSTRUCTIVE SOLUTIONS I REALLY APPRECIATE YOUR BEING HERE. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER WELCOME GENTLEMEN TWO WITNESSES TWO MINUTES EACH TELL YOU DECIDE WHO STARTS. AGAIN I MATH DEVOTO I'M A TWENTY ONE YEAR OLD FOOTHILL COLLEGE STUDENT AND I SPENT ABOUT TWO YEARS. HOMELESS SLEEPING IN MY CAR PRIMARILY. I WAS A FULL TIME STUDENT DURING THAT TIME AND WORKED A FULL TIE JOB. TRYING TO PACK IN MY CLASSES -- AROUND MY WORK SCHEDULE AND IT UP WORKING FOURTEEN HOUR DAYS TO MAINTAIN A FULL TIME JOB. BUT EVEN WITH OVER TIME IN DOUBLE TIME DURING THAT. I WAS STILL NOT ABLE TO AFFORD. A HOUSE A PLACE TO LIVE IN AND PAY RENT. I WASN'T WELCOME TO SLEEP ON CAMPUS WHEN I WAS SLEEPING IN MY CAR I WAS ASKED TO LEAVE SEVERAL TIMES BY POLICE AND AS A RESULT. I WOULD SLEEP IN THE NEARBY COMMUNITIES. A WHICH WAS NOT WELL RECEIVED BY THE RESIDENTS OF THE AREA. MY CAR MY HOME. THE ONLY THING I HAD TO MY NAME WAS DAMAGED. PENALIZED BY PEOPLE IN THE AREA AND I REALIZED I WAS NO LONGER SOMEWHERE SAFE AND AS TAKE IT'S PILED UP I REALIZED I WAS NOT SOMEWHERE LEGAL. I ENDED UP PARKING FURTHER AND FURTHER FROM CAMPUS. BUT EACH MORNING I WOULD TRAVEL BACK TO SHOWER TO START MY DAY BEFORE WORK AND CLASS. HAD AB THREE TWO BEEN IN EFFECT I WOULD HAVE A LOT I WOULD HAVE BEEN ALLOWED TO STAY NEAR THE RESOURCES THAT EXIST ON CAMPUS. SUCH AS FOOD PANTRIES SHOWERS AND HEALTH SERVICES. SHOULD HAVE CUT DOWN MY COMMUTE TIME ALLOWED ME TO SLEEP MORE AND BE IN A SAFE ENVIRONMENT. THERE FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND OTHER STUDENTS THAT ARE IN NEED OF THIS BILL. OFTEN THE STUDENTS ARE ATTENDING COMMUNITY COLLEGES TO TRYING TO SKATE. FROM POVERTY AND HOMELESSNESS. WITH SCHOOLS BEING ONE OF THE FEW STABLE AND SAFE ENVIRONMENTS THAT CAN ALLOW STUDENTS TO OBTAIN THE ACADEMIC SKILLS. THEY NEED TO ESCAPE FROM POVERTY AND HOMELESSNESS SOMETIMES AN ASSOCIATE'S DEGREE CERTIFICATE -- EVENTUAL BACHELOR'S DEGREE. CAN MEAN THE WORLD TO THEM. THIS BILL WILL BE PROVIDING STUDENTS HOMELESS STUDENTS A SAFE PLACE TO SIMPLY EXIST IN AN ENVIRONMENT THAT SUPPORTS THEM AND PROVIDE SOME WITH MANY RESOURCES. TO RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR I'VE. THANK YOU THANK YOU NEXT WITNESS. HELLO GOOD MORNING HOW TO START BY SAYING ALL THANKFUL I AM TO BE HERE SPEAKING ON BEHALF OF THE NEARLY FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND STUDENTS WHO FACE HOMELESSNESS LAST YEAR. MY NAME IS ANTHONY WHITE I'M TWENTY EIGHT YEARS OLD I'M A FATHER A HUSBAND. A STUDENT AND A VETERAN. I'M ALSO FORMALLY HOMELESS. SURELY AFTER LEAVING THE MARINE CORPS MY PLANS DID NOT WORK OUT AND I FOUND MYSELF LIVING IN MY TRUCK FOR MY PICKUP TRUCK FOR ABOUT EIGHT MONTHS IN THE NORTH SAN DIEGO COUNTY AREA. I WORK DURING THE DAY WOULD ATTEND CLASSES IN THE EVENING. I WORKED HARD TO GET OTHER SITUATION I WAS IN WHAT WAS A CONSTANT STRUGGLE. ONE OF THE BIGGEST CHALLENGES I FACED WAS FINDING A SAFE PLACE TO SLEEP AT NIGHT. I ONLY WANTED TO BE SAFE SO I CAN SLEEP UNDISTURBED AND ON DISTURBING. I WOULD PARK IN FRONT OF LOWS BECAUSE THE WIFE I REACHED THE PARKING LOT. SO I COULD DO MY HOMEWORK. OR I WOULD PARK BEHIND WAREHOUSES IN THE BUSINESS PARK IN OCEANSIDE BOULEVARD BECAUSE THEY WERE WELL LET CLOSE TO CAMPUS. IF AB THREE TWO HAD BEEN LAW. I WOULD HAVE HAD ACCESS TO MY COMMUNITY COLLEGE TO PROGRAM THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN LIFE CHANGING. AND MAY HAVE MEANT THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN ME STAYING IN SCHOOL OR DROPPING OUT. WHICH ULTIMATELY DID BECAUSE OF THE STRESS OF THE SITUATION I WAS IN. THANKFULLY IS A VETERAN I HAVE ACCESS TO RESOURCES THAT MOST STUDENTS DON'T. AND I WAS ABLE TO FIND STABLE HOUSING. SINCE THEN I'VE BEEN ENROLLED IN SCHOOL AND ON MY WAY TO COMPLETE MY BACHELORS IN BUSINESS. BUT TONIGHT MANY STUDENTS WILL STILL BE IN THEIR CARS. FACED WITH THE CHOICE OF WHERE TO PARK FOR JUST ENOUGH TIME TO CLOSE THE RICE AND FILL THAT MOST BASIC HUMAN NEED OF A SAFE NIGHT'S SLEEP. I'M HERE TODAY TO DISPEL SOME OF THE STIGMA SURROUNDING HOMELESSNESS. I AM HERE AS A TRUE TO LIFE EXAMPLE OF THE KIND OF STUDENTS WHO NEED AB. THREE OH TWO THESE ARE THE SAME STUDENTS THAT ARE IN OUR CLASSROOMS. THEY'RE ON OUR CAMPUSES INTERACTING WITH US EVERY DAY. THEY'RE NOT DRUG ABUSERS FOR THE SEVERELY MENTALLY ILL. BUT YOUNG MEN AND WOMEN WHO WANT A BETTER WAY OF LIFE. LIKE MANY OF YOU I BELIEVE THAT COMMUNITY COLLEGE SHOULD BE A GATEWAY TO A BETTER FUTURE. AND THAT BASIC NEEDS SHOULDN'T BE A BARRIER TO EDUCATION. BEING HOMELESS IS EXTREMELY LONELY. AND I OFTEN SAY BEING HOMELESS MEANS BEING IN THE COMMUNITY WITHOUT BEING A PART OF IT. BUT AT COMMUNITY COLLEGES THAT SHOULD BE TAKEN TO HEART. IT'S BECAUSE OF THIS THAT I HOPE YOU'LL SUPPORT AB THREE OH TWO AND IN DOING SO REMIND MY BROTHERS AND SISTERS YOUR SONS AND DAUGHTERS ARE FELLOW CALIFORNIANS. BUT THEY HAVE NOT BEEN FORGOTTEN.

FIRST WE BEGIN BY THINKING ALL THE MEMBERS THAT WE MET WITH -- AND REALLY THINKING THE STAFF FOR TAKING THE TIME AN A VERY THOUGHTFUL ANALYSIS. AS YOU KNOW NEARLY SIXTY YEARS AGO CALIFORNIA APPROVED THE CALIFORNIA MASTER PLAN. A PLAN THAT WOULD RESOURCE THIS THE STUDENTS AT THE HIGHEST LEVEL OF OUR UNIVERSITIES BUT THE GREATEST AMOUNT OF RESOURCES. AND THIS SYSTEM THAT SERVICE THE LARGEST PROPORTION OF CALIFORNIANS WITH THE LOWEST LEVEL OF RESOURCES. TODAY THIS AN EQUITABLE AN ANTIQUATED SYSTEM CONTINUES TO BE AN ISSUE AMOUNTS ARE COLLEGES. AND A MICRO AGGRESSION AMONGST MANY OF THE BILLS THAT YOU CONSIDER SUCH AS AB THREE OF TWO AB THREE OH TWO PERPETUATES. THE STRUCTURAL INEQUITIES BY SAYING THAT. STUDENTS THAT ATTEND THESE COLLEGES A STUDENT A COLLEGE SYSTEM THAT SERVES THE GREATEST PROPORTION OF VETERANS THE GREATEST PORTION OF LOW INCOME STUDENTS. THE GREATEST PROPORTION OF STUDENTS OF COLOR PARENTS AND OTHERS SEEKING A BETTER LIFE. GET PARKING LOTS. THE POLICY YOU'RE CONSIDERING DOES NOT RESOURCE OUR COLLEGES TO ADEQUATELY SERVE AND ADDRESS THE CHALLENGES THEIR STUDENTS FACE. IT DOES NOT PROVIDE A REAL SOLUTION TO HOUSING. IT ALSO MATH TO THE REAL CHALLENGES THEIR STUDENTS FACE AROUND FINANCIAL AID. AROUND A SYSTEM THAT IS UNDER FUNDED. ARE THAT SOMETIMES WE JUST NEED BETTER SERVICES FOR STUDENTS -- AS THE ONES THAT WE WERE -- MENTIONED BY OUR WITNESSES. THAT ACTUALLY HELP THEM COMPLETE THEIR DEGREE [inaudible] SO. WE ASK YOU. TO INSTEAD TO CONSIDER THE REAL SOLUTIONS THAT ARE COLLEGES NEED IN ORDER TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE FOR EXAMPLE FINANCIAL AID SUCH AS SB -- TWO NINETY ONE AND THAT YOU DON'T DISMISS THE LEGISLATURE AND THE STATE'S RESPONSIBILITY TO TRULY ADDRESS THIS ISSUE. WE ASK THAT ARE WE TO LEAVE YOU WITH A CALL TO ACTION. TO FIND A REAL SOLUTION FOR THE HOUSING AND HOMELESS CHALLENGES THAT OUR STUDENTS FACE. AND THAT ARE YOU CONSIDER WHAT THIS BILL IS ACTUALLY ASKING. AND THAT COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENTS DESERVE MORE THAN PARKING LOTS THANK YOU. THANK YOU NEXT WITNESS. THANK YOU -- CHAIR MEMBERS MARK MCDONALD MCCALLUM GROUP ON BEHALF OF THE SAN BERNADINO KERN. AND SAN DIEGO COMMUNITY COLLEGE DISTRICT AND WE HAVE AN OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED -- POSITION WOULD LIKE TO SEE THE BILL MORE LIKE A PILOT PROJECT WHERE DISTRICTS COULD OPT IN AND PRE PROVIDED WITH FUNDING IF THEY WERE TO DO THAT -- THERE ARE NUMBER OF ISSUES WITH THE BILL -- DOES INCLUDE FUNDING SAFETY CLEAN UP AND OVERALL IMPLEMENTATION OF SECURING THE PARKING LOTS -- BUT I WANT. TO I WANT TO COMPLIMENT THE ANALYSIS BECAUSE THE REAL POLICY QUESTION IS IN THE ANALYSIS ON PAGE. FIVE WHERE IT SAYS COMMUNITY COLLEGES ARE NOT TRADITIONALLY EQUIPPED TO HOUSE SUITS STUDENTS IN THIS MANNER -- COULD THE ACTIONS ABOVE MEANING THE RAPID RE HOUSING AND SENATOR YOUR BILL SB TWO NINETY ONE BE BETTER SOLUTIONS AND WE WOULD SAY THAT THOSE ARE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU ADDITIONAL WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. KLAY WALKER WITH NASA MEN ON BEHALF OF MOUNT SAN ANTONIO COLLEGE AND NORTH ORANGE COUNTY COMMUNITY COLLEGE DISTRICT.

JUSTIN SELMA COMBAT FOR THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNICABLE JUST CHANCES OFFICE WE DO NOT HAVE AN OFFICIAL POSITION ON THE BILL AT THIS TIME. WE DO APPRECIATE THE AUTHORS LEADERSHIP ON THIS CRITICAL ISSUE -- BUT I WOULD POINT TO SOME OF THE COMMENTS MADE BY THE LEAGUE REGARDING THE THE LOW. PER STUDENT FUNDING RATES THAT THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES RECEIVE COMPARED TO OTHER SEGMENTS AS WELL AS THE THE DEARTH OF CAL GRANT FUNDS THAT OUR STUDENTS RECEIVE. THE LEGISLATURE WISHES -- SOMETHING LIKE THIS TO HAPPEN THERE SHOULD BE FUNDING -- TO TO ALLOW US TO FILL THIS SORT OF MANDATE AND ALSO. THEY NEED MORE IMPORTANTLY TO GET MORE FINANCIAL AID RESOURCES INTO OUR STUDENTS HANDS THANK YOU. THANK YOU ANY ADDITIONAL OPPOSITION. REFER BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE I'D LIKE TO MAKE A COUPLE COMMENTS. I WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR AGAIN HE AND I HAD SOME LONG CONVERSATIONS ABOUT THIS. AND IT IS NOT A SOLUTION AS YOU SAID BUT IT IS HOPEFULLY GOING TO SERVE AN IMMEDIATE NEED. BUT I WOULD LIKE TO PUT THE ONEROUS ON ALL OF US IN THE LEGISLATURE REALLY ALL OF US TO CHANGE THE SITUATION. WHEN I WENT TO COMMUNITY COLLEGE IN WAS AN EIGHTEEN YEAR OLD WORKING STUDENT IT WASN'T LIKE THIS BUT I WOULD ALSO CHALLENGES NOT ONLY ARE HOUSING PRICES HIGH? WE NEED BETTER JOBS AND UNTIL WE CHALLENGE CORPORATE AMERICA I HAD A GOOD UNION JOB IN IN NINETEEN EIGHTY EIGHT THIRTY ONE YEARS AGO I ME TWELVE FIFTY AN HOUR. SO I COULD SUPPORT MYSELF AND I COULD GO TO COMMUNITY COLLEGE SO UNTIL WE HAVE WAGES THAT ARE COMMENSURATE WITH WHAT IS HAPPENING IN SOCIETY I THINK WE'LL CONTINUE TO FIND OURSELVES. IN THE SITUATION BUT I THINK YOU OUGHT TO THE AUTHOR TO THE WITNESSES FOR COMING FORWARD AND TELLING YOUR STORIES -- SOMETIMES UP HERE IN SACRAMENTO. WE DON'T SEE YOU AND I THINK IT'S VERY IMPORTANT FOR EVERYONE TO SEE BOTH OF YOU AND KNOW THAT THIS IS A VERY REAL PROBLEM SO I THINK YOU I THINK THE AUTHOR -- MY COMMITMENT TO YOU I HOPE I HOPE I GET TO BE HERE FOR EIGHT MORE YEARS AND LET'S NOT LET'S MAKE THIS A SHORT TERM FIX. AND TRY TO FIND A LONG TERM SOLUTION WITHOUT ALL OPEN UP TO THE COMMITTEE FOR ANY QUESTIONS COMMENTS CONCERNS CENTER DRAWS A YES -- THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR OF ALL OF YOUR REMARKS DIGITAL -- VERY SUPPORTIVE OF OF WHAT YOU ALL LAID OUT RIGHT NOW AND I ALSO HAD CONVERSATION WITH THE AUTHOR THANK YOU. AND THANK YOU TO OUR OUR WITNESSES FOR FOR BEING HERE -- I DO HAVE SIMILAR CONCERNS -- ABOUT WHAT THIS ALL MEANS AND THE IMPACT THAT WORKED WERE TRYING TO HAVE -- THE ISSUE OF NOT THIS NOT BEING A SOLUTION HOW DO WE USE OUR DOLLARS -- HOW ARE THEY BEST SPENT -- WITH REGARDS TO GETTING STUDENTS OUT OF THEIR CARS. AND IT'S NOT A IT'S NOT A GOOD. DOG GOAL TO HAVE IS TO GET OUT OF HERE YOU KNOW TO HAVE A PLACE. TO PARK YOUR CARS. THE GOAL NEEDS TO BE TO GET YOU OUT OF YOUR CARS AND INTO AN APARTMENT INTO A HOME. THAT'S THAT'S THE GOAL SO I GUESS I'M A CONCERNED ABOUT HOW DOES THIS. LEAD TO THE REAL GOAL HOW DOES THIS HELP CHANGE -- OUR COMMUNITY COLLEGES IN SUCH A WAY THAT THEY CAN DO THAT -- AND NOT JUST OKAY HERE'S A BANDAID AND LET'S PRETEND WE REALLY DID SOMETHING TO CHANGE -- CHANGE THE DIRECTION THAT WE SHOULD BE IT -- GOING IN SO I'M CONCERNED ABOUT THAT ARE THESE IS THIS THE BEST WAY TO SPEND OUR DOLLARS -- HOW DO WE HELP OUR COMMUNITY COLLEGES GET THE RESOURCES THAT STUDENTS NEED TO GET OUT OF BEING HOMELESS AND HAVING TO LIVE OUT OF THEIR CARS -- HOW DO WE HAVE RELIABLE FUNDING IF IT'S A MANDATE HOW DO WE MAKE SURE THEY HAVE THE RELIABLE FUNDING AND THAT IT DOESN'T TAKE AWAY FROM SOMETHING ELSE THAT WERE ALSO FIGHTING? FOR AND THAT WE FALL SHORT OF OUR MANY TIMES BUT A MANDATE WITHOUT RELIABLE FUNDING SOURCE I THINK IS A IS A HUGE PROBLEM IT WHO MAKES THE DECISION BOUT HOW TO WHAT DO YOU TAKE AWAY FROM? IN ORDER TO FULFILL. THIS MANDATE. AND THE AND THIS PARTICULAR QUESTIONS BUT I I THINK THOSE ARE THE THE PRIMARY ISSUES. OF A PARTICULAR QUESTIONS ABOUT HOW WILL FAMILIES THERE ARE STUDENTS I'M SURE BECAUSE THIS IS A COMMUNITY COLLEGES SERVE WORKING CLASS. ADULTS -- MANY OF WHOM HAVE -- FAMILIES HOW WILL THEY BE DEALT WITH IN THIS KIND OF SITUATION -- WITH THE NEEDS THAT THEY HAVE SO -- I URGE YOU TO PLEASE CONTINUE TO WORK WITH COMMUNITY COLLEGE I KNOW OUR COMMUNITY COLLEGES AND LA OR MANY OF THEM ARE WORKING REALLY HARD. TO A BE ABLE TO CONNECT THE STUDENTS WITH THE RIGHT RESOURCES -- SO OVERALL HOW DO WE MAKE SURE THIS IS REALLY SERIOUSLY A PART OF THE BIGGER GOAL THAT WE HAVE. ON AND NOT ONLY OKAY.

TO COME UP WITH SOME STE -- IMMEDIATE SOLUTIONS TO A PROBLEM THAT'S VERY PRESENT RIGHT NOW IT'S NOT THE SOLUTION AND BY ANY MEANS IT'S FACT IT'S SHOULDN'T BE THE SOLUTION -- IN THE LONG TERM -- BUT AND I'M I ALSO KNOWLEDGE YOU KNOW THE WORK THAT COMMITTEE COLLEGES VERTICALLY THOSE IN MY DISTRICT I KNOW ACROSS THE STATE HAVE BEEN WORKING ON THIS ISSUE OF HOMELESSNESS -- AND TRYING TO APPROACH THAT -- WOULD ALSO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT AS WE'RE GOING TO THE BUDGET PROCESS IN THE GOVERNOR'S LEADERSHIP -- AND AS WELL AND TRYING TO PUT MRE RESOURCES TOWARD HOMELESSNESS AND IT IS -- UNITED IT'S PART OF A LARGER PROBLEM IS NOT JUST ABOUT COMMUNITY COLLEGES AND STUDENTS COMMUTE BECAUSE BUT WE NEED TO CREATE -- THOSE SPACES SO -- I L. B. PLEASE TO VOTE FOR YOUR BILL TODAY BECAUSE WE NEED TO CONTINUE TO HAVE THIS -- THIS OPTION -- I'M SURE YOU'LL BE WORKING WITH -- THE OPPOSITION TO MAKE OUR TREES I THINK WE'RE TAKING SOME GOOD AMENDMENTS CELL WE HAVE A SUNSET BECAUSE AGAIN THIS ISN'T. THE LONG TERM SOLUTION -- BUT I I CERTAINLY APPRECIATE THAT -- USE STEPPING UP AND SAYING WELL WE NEED TO DO SOMETHING TO TRUST IMMEDIATE PROBLEMS LOW LIKE TRIAGE RATED SAYS THAT'S NOT THE FINAL TREATMENT BUT YOU GOT TO DO SOMETHING. TO STAUNCH THE BLEEDING RIGHT NOW AND WITH THAT IF YOU SEE SOME OF THE BUILT APPROPRIATE TIME. THANK YOU CENTER PAN ANY FURTHER QUESTIONS COMMENTS SENATOR WILK THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR I WANT I WANT TO THANK -- OUR SPEAKERS YOU BOTH PHENOMENAL VERY ARTICULATE AND AND AND MADE THAT MADE THE CASE. AND HOW DARE YOU SEE SOME IN BERMAN YOU'VE NOT SOLVE THE WHOLE HOUSING -- CRISIS IN THIS BILL MY NAME ON YOU FOR BRINGING IT ON COULD PROPOSAL TO THE SENATE. LOOK IT AND I AGREE DOCTOR PAN. WE WISH WE WEREN'T HAVING TO DO THIS BUT I REMEMBER FIVE YEARS AGO BECAUSE CO AUTHOR ON THE BILL THAT OPEN UP SHOWERS AND COMMUNITY COLLEGES. THAT BILLS AUTHORED BY DAS WILLIAMS WHO HIMSELF WAS HOMELESS WHEN HE WAS IN COMMUNITY COLLEGE -- I HAD AS A COMMITTEE FOR YEARS AGO SAYING YOU A WAY TO CREATE BETTER STABILITY FOR COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENTS IS TO HAVE. COLLEGES OFFER PO BOXES FOR THOSE STUDENTS WHO ARE HOMELESS. I THOUGHT THAT'S A GREAT IDEA SO I MEAN WITH THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE THEY GO WELL SENATOR WE DON'T NEED TO DO THAT BECAUSE EVERY STUDENT HAS AN OFFICIAL RESIDENCE BECAUSE THEY CAN'T REGISTER WITHOUT OFFICIAL RESIDENCE -- WE KNOW THAT'S BALK -- AND AND WE HAVE IT WE HAVE A SERIOUS PROBLEM AND ALL THIS IS. IS TRYING TO HELP PEOPLE WHO ARE IN NEED AND IS GOING TO BE SLOPPY. AND THEY HAVE CHALLENGES BUT I MEAN IT IS MORALLY I THOUGHT FEEL COMPELLED THAT THAT THAT YOU KNOW WE WE WE ABSOLUTELY HAVE HAVE TO DO IT. SO -- SO I I COMMEND YOU FOR THAT IN SOME OF THE PROPOSAL FIRST OF ALL BY THE WAY ALL THE ALL YOUR COMMITTEE MINUTES EXCELLENT I MEAN I THINK IT MAKES A BILL. YOU SAID A WEEKEND AND I THINK IT MAKES IT BETTER -- WHAT AS WELL? PRIVATE CONVERSATION YOU NEED -- I JUST ADDED YOU I'M SO SORRY DID THAT. SO SORRY DO THAT. ANYWAY. IT LIKE THEY'RE GREAT BUT YOU KNOW THE I THINK THE POINT I THINK I THINK THE MORE THING IS THE THE POINT IS THAT THE SENSE IT'S IN THERE. HAVING PEOPLE OFTEN I DON'T THINK THEY'RE GONNA OFTEN AND THE OTHER THING I THINK THIS COULD BE AN EDUCATIONAL PROPOSITION FOR THE GENERAL PUBLIC BECAUSE I THINK A LOT OF THE STUDENTS BECAUSE I FIGURE I DON'T EVER SAY I WAS HOMELESS ALMOST BUT I HOP. I SLEPT ON CHARACTERS FOR ABOUT THREE MONTHS -- IN MY COLLEGE DAYS. I THINK IT'S GOING TO ALLOW THE GENERAL PUBLIC TO UNDERSTAND WHAT. THE HOMELESS IMPACT IS BECAUSE I DON'T THINK AS THE THESE ARE THESE ARE GHOST PEOPLE THEY'RE DOING WHATEVER THEY CAN TO SURVIVE THEY'RE NOT MEN LEO HILL THEY'RE NOT THE PEOPLE WE SEE ON THE STREETS AND SACRAMENTO OR OTHER PLACES. AND IT'S VERY PREVALENT AND AND I THINK POLICIES IN PLACE SO WE ADDRESS THE OVERALL. PROGRAM SO IS MUCH AS IT PAINS ME TO VOTE FOR THE BILL TODAY BECAUSE I WISH WE DIDN'T HAVE TO DO IT IT'S IT'S IT'S A NEED IT'S A NEEDED BANDAID -- AND I WILL BE SUPPORTIVE THANK YOU CENTER THANK YOU CENTER WILK WE ALL JUST LEARNED THAT WE SHOULD NOT TELL YOU ANYTHING A CONFIDENCE. WHY WE LOVE COMMITTEE HEARINGS WHO IS LEARN SOMETHING NEW? BEFORE YOU CLOSE ASSEMBLY MEMBER BERMAN AND I DO KNOW YOU LOVED ALL THE AMENDMENTS. I DO. I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE ONE KNOWS THERE IS NINE MILLION DOLLARS IN THE BUDGET -- TO COMMUNITY COLLEGES THOSE MONIES CAN BE USED FOR ALL THE PROGRAM'S LINED OUT IN THIS BILL WITHOUT WHICH LIKE TO CLOSE THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR -- AND THEN AGAIN REALLY THANK YOU FOR THE CONVERSATIONS THAT WE'VE HAD IN THAT OUR COMMITTEE OUR THAT OUR STATUS OF HAD -- THE BILL DOES WEEKEND MY ORIGINAL INTENT TO MAKE EVERY COMMUNITY COLLEGE DO THIS BUT I THINK IT'S ALSO GOOD TO PROVIDE AN INCENTIVE TO DO MORE OF TRYING TO ACTUALLY GET PEOPLE OUT OF THEIR CARS WHICH THE AMENDMENTS ARE. ARE YOU KNOW THAT THAT'S THE GOAL OF THE AMENDMENTS -- THIS ENCOURAGE MORE COMMUNITY COLLEGES TO DO MORE IN TERMS OF RAPIDLY HOUSING IN HOTEL VOUCHERS AND AND OTHER PROGRAMS TO TRY TO GET. THEIR STUDENTS OUT OF THEIR CARS -- BUT FROM TALKING TO A LOT OF THE HOMELESSNESS LIAISONS AT COMMUNITY COLLEGES ACROSS THE STATE ONE OF THE BIGGEST PROBLEMS THEY HAVE. IS THEY DON'T KNOW WHO'S HOMELESS -- AND STUDENTS ARE OUR EXCHANGE THEY SHOULDN'T BE BECAUSE SOCIETY'S FAULT BUT STUDENTS ARE SHAME TO COME FORWARD AND SAY THAT THEY'RE IN THE SITUATION -- AND SO WE NEED TO BREAK DOWN THOSE WALLS OF OF STIGMATIZATION. ABOUT STUDENT HOMELESSNESS WE NEED TO CREATE A SYSTEM WHICH THIS DOES IN WHICH THE AMENDMENTS ALSO FURTHER ON YOU KNOW THAT EFFORT. TO TRY TO ENCOURAGE STUDENTS. TO TO COME IN AND ASK FOR HELP AND WE NEED OUR COMMUNITY COLLEGES TO DO A BETTER JOB OF TELLING OUR STUDENTS WHAT HELP IS AVAILABLE I LOOKED AT THE WEBSITES OF FOR THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES IN MY DISTRICT IN AROUND MY DISTRICT ONE OF THEM -- INDIAN CEMETERY COUNTY IT HAD A DROP DOWN IT SAID SOMETHING TO THE EFFECT OF HOUSING ASSISTANCE. AS AWESOME GREAT UNDER STUDENT SERVICES YOU CLICK ON THE DROP DOWN HOUSING ASSISTANCE I CLICKED ON IT AND WHAT IT WAS WAS A GLORIFIED CRAIG'S LIST PAGE. ARE YOU LOOKING FOR AN APARTMENT OR DO YOU HAVE AN APARTMENT TO RENT. THAT'S NOT THE HOUSING ASSISTANCE THAT OUR COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENTS NEED -- AND AND SO -- WE WE THEN AND NOT SURE YOU BROUGHT THE ISSUE OF WAGES. A STUDY CAME OUT TODAY MY DISTRICT COVERS TWO DIFFERENT COUNTY SAN MATEO COUNTY SANTA CLARA COUNTY IN SAN MATEO COUNTY YOU HAVE TO MAKE AND I'M JUST TRYING TO REMEMBER OFF THE TOP OF MY HEAD BUT I THINK WAS A HUNDRED AND TWENTY SEVEN THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR. TO AFFORD A TWO BEDROOM HOUSE OR APARTMENT. IN SANTA CLARA COUNTY IT'S IT WAS ABOUT A HUNDRED FOURTEEN THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR THAT'S INSANE -- THE MASTER PLAN WAS ALLUDED TO AND I AGREE IT IS COMPLETELY ANTIQUATED WHICH IS WHY THE DAY I JOIN THE STATE ASSEMBLY I CREATED A SELECT COMMITTEE ON THE NINETEEN SIXTY MASTER PLAN FOR HIGHER EDUCATION -- AND HELD HEARINGS ALL THROUGHOUT THE STATE LAST YEAR TO IN SACRAMENTO ONE IN SAN JOSE ONE FRESNO ONE OF RIVERSIDE WHERE I HEARD FROM SO MANY STUDENTS ABOUT THE BASIC NEEDS IN SECURITY THEY'RE FACING THE FIRST ISSUE WAS. HOMELESSNESS THE SECOND ISSUE WAS FOOD AND SECURITY AND THE THIRD ISSUE WAS A LACK OF ACCESS TO MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ON CAMPUS. AND THAT COMPRISE 95% OF THE COMMENTS THAT I HEARD FROM HUNDREDS OF STUDENTS ACROSS THE STATE -- AND AND I KNOW SOME COMMUNITY COLLEGES SAID HEY WE GOT SNOW WE'RE WE'VE GOT HUNDRED DEGREE WEATHER AND AND THIS ISN'T SAFE. THE STUDENTS ARE DOING THIS TONIGHT. THIS BILL DOESN'T CREATE STUDENTS SLEEPING IN THEIR CAR THIS BILL TRIES TO PROVIDE A SAFER PLACE FOR THEM TO DO WHAT THEY'RE ALREADY DOING -- AND IF WE CAN FIND AN EVEN BETTER OPTION AND THE STATE NEEDS TO DO A BETTER JOB OF FUNDING THAT BETTER OPTION THAN A FULLY SUPPORTED I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR YOUR BILL THAT YOU'RE DOING. TO TO UPDATES FINANCIAL AID FOR COMMUNICABLE STUDENTS CAUSES DESPERATELY NEEDED -- THE THE AND AND TO TO GET YOU KNOW. MAKE CLEAR TO EVERYBODY. HI AND I IMAGINE NOBODY ELSE IS GOING TO VOTE YES ON THIS BILL AND THEN SAY OKAY WE SOLVE THE PROBLEM -- THIS IS REALLY A BANDAID A SHORT TERM TRIAGE SOLUTION -- WHILE WE WORK ON ON THE LONGER TERM -- ISSUES SO -- AND I LOOK FOR TO WORKING WITH EVERYBODY INCLUDING FOLKS WHO DON'T LIKE THIS BILL TO ADDRESS THEIR CONCERNS TO WORK ON THOSE ISSUES I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AYE VOTE THANK YOU.

JUST LAST NOVEMBER MASS SHOOTING A BORDERLINE BAR AND GRILL IN THOUSAND OAKS CALIFORNIA RESULTED IN TWELVE DEATHS. LAST YEAR THE AMERICAN COLLEGE OF PHYSICIANS PUBLISHED A POSITION PAPER THAT RECOMMENDS A PUBLIC HEALTH APPROACH THE FARMS RELATED VIOLENCE. IN THE PREVENTION OF FIREARM INJURIES AND DEATHS. WHILE MANY HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS RECOGNIZE THE RESPONSIBILITY TO HELP PREVENT FARM RELATED INJURY AND DEATH. MANY CITE A LACK OF KNOWLEDGE REGARDING WHEN AND HOW TO COUNSEL PATIENTS. AS A PRINCIPAL BARRIER TO ACTION. A POSITION STATEMENT ADOPTED BY THE CALIFORNIA MEDICAL ASSOCIATION IN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN STATED THAT EXPANDED EDUCATION AND TRAINING ARE NEEDED.

AND IS A PRACTICING EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN. LIKE MY CLINICAL COLLEAGUES I AM WELL AWARE OF THE IMPORTANCE OF PREVENTION MOST PEOPLE WHO DIE FROM GUNSHOT WOUNDS DIE WERE THERE SHOT DOESN'T MATTER HOW GOOD THE MEDICAL CARE SYSTEM IS. THESE PEOPLE ARE JUST DEAD FROM MOVES THAT ARE NOT SURVIVABLE. SO PREVENTION HERE IS HAS IMPORTANT AS IS PREVENTION OF DEATHS FROM CANCER AND HEART DISEASE FROM MOTOR VEHICLE CRASHES THEMSELVES. THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER MENTIONED THERE'S BEEN A SURGE OF INTEREST ON THE PART OF HEALTH PROFESSIONALS NOT JUST HERE IN CALIFORNIA BUT NATIONWIDE TO GET OFF THE SIDELINES. TO GET INTO PREVENTING THE PROBLEM THAT THEY TREAT ACUTELY AND TREAT THE CONSEQUENCES OF THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO THIS IS NEW TO MEDICINE IT'S NEW TO THE HEALTH PROFESSIONS. AND THE PROPOSAL IS TO CREATE THE CURRICULUM AND THE MATERIALS AT THE OUT REACH SYSTEM TO A QUICK HEALTH PROFESSIONALS IN CALIFORNIA TO TAKE ON THIS IMPORTANT NEW JOB AND ALSO TO SET A MODEL. FOR HEALTH PROFESSIONALS AND ORGANIZATIONS IN OTHER STATES WHICH QUITE FRANKLY MODEL SETTING IS ONE OF THE THINGS THAT CALIFORNIA DOES BEST -- I WILL MAKE JUST ONE OBSERVATION AND THEN FINISH. THIS INTEREST IS NOT ON THE PART OF HEALTH PROFESSIONALS THEMSELVES ARE CENTER HAS JUST RECENTLY COMPLETED A SURVEY OF THE GENERAL PUBLIC IN CALIFORNIA. AND WE FIND THAT MORE THAN 90% OF CALIFORNIANS AND MORE THAN SUPPORT CONVERSATIONS BETWEEN HEALTH PROFESSIONALS AND PATIENTS ABOUT FIREARMS SAFETY WHEN IT'S RELEVANT WHICH IS WHEN WE RECOMMEND THOSE CONVERSATIONS.

THERE THE PEOPLE ARE SHOT BY TODDLERS AT LEAST WEEKLY. AND UNITED STATES. SO THINK ABOUT THAT TODDLERS WERE ABLE TO GET ALL THE GUN AND SHOOT SOMEONE WEEKLY. I THINK WE CAN PRESUME THAT WAS NOT INTENTIONAL. BUT THE FACT THAT THEY COULD ACCESS TO A GUN AND AND BE ABLE TO PULL THE TRIGGER AND OF THE LOADED AND THAT WOULD ACTUALLY SHOOT SOMEONE IS SOMETHING. THAT WE SHOULD GIVE PAUSE TO AND I THINK CERTAINLY IS -- PEDIATRICIAN -- THEY KNOW THE AMERICAN CAT PEDIATRICS HAS GUIDELINES ABOUT COUNSELING FAMILIES ABOUT SAFETY THIS IS REALLY WHAT IT'S ABOUT AND I APPRECIATE BRING THE BILL FORWARD AND GENTLY HAPPEN TO MOVE IT TO PROTOTYPE THANK YOU. THANK YOU CENTER PAN SENATOR WILK. A AT THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR I VERY KHAMIS'S PROPOSAL SURPRISED THAT WE HAVEN'T DONE IT SOONER.

THANK YOU MEMBERS ASSEMBLY MEMBER WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR A VOTE THANK YOU THE BILL HAS BEEN MOVED BY SENATOR PAM AM SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. ITEM SEVEN EIGHTY FIVE TWENTY ONE THE MOTION IS DUE PASSED PUBLIC SAFETY LEYVA AYE LEYVA AYE WILK. WILK I CHIANG CHIANG AYE LASSELL. RUSSELL AYE GLAZER MCGUIRE PAN CAN I THE BILL HAS ENOUGH VOTES TO GET OUT WE WILL LEAVE IT OPEN FOR ADDITIONAL MEMBERS TO ADD ON THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

AB SEVEN SEVENTY THREE WILL HELP QUIPPED YOUNG ADULTS TO BECOME ENGAGED CITIZENS BY REQUIRING SCHOOL DISTRICTS TO IMPLEMENT VOTER EDUCATION PROGRAMMING FOR HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS. I'LL REMIND FOLKS THAT SO MANY OF US LEARNED HOW TO VOTE BY GOING WITH HER PARENTS ARE LEARNED FROM OUR PARENTS IN TODAY'S HIGH SCHOOLERS THERE ARE SO MANY WHO HAVE PARENTS WHO ARE IN ELIGIBLE TO VOTE OR HAVE NEVER VOTED THEMSELVES. AND SO WE HAVE DONE TREMENDOUS EFFORTS TO REGISTER TO PRE REGISTER TO ENGAGE THESE VOTERS BUT WE'VE NEVER TOLD THEM WHAT THEY'RE GOING TO BE DOING. SO THE MECHANICS OF VOTING CAN BE SCARY FOR PEOPLE WHO AREN'T FAMILIAR WITH THIS WITH THE SYSTEM NOT GETTING IT RIGHT CAN BE SCARY. OUR YOUNG VOTER SHOULD KNOW HOW TO REGISTER TO VOTE WHAT THE DEADLINES WHAT DEADLINES EXIST HAD RETURNED A BALLOT TO COUNTY ELECTIONS OFFICIALS HAD ACQUIRE LANGUAGE ACCESS MATERIALS AND INFORMATION ON THE RIGHT TO THE VOTER HOW TO GET NONPARTISAN INFORMATION ABOUT WHAT'S ON THE BALLOT. THESE ARE SIMPLE THINGS TO TEACH BUT CAN MAKE A WORLD OF DIFFERENCE FOR YOUNG VOTERS. AB SEVEN SEVENTY THREE WILL ACCOMPLISH THIS BY REQUIRING THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION AND THE SECRETARY OF STATE TO DEVELOP EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMMING FOR IMPLEMENTATION OF THE LOCAL LEVEL. LOCAL COUNTY ELECTIONS OFFICIALS WILL ALSO BE REQUIRED TO ENSURE THAT PROGRAMMING IS SPECIFICALLY TAILORED TO THE ELECTION SYSTEM IN THAT COUNTY AS WE KNOW COUNTY BY COUNTY OR BALLOTS LOOK DIFFERENT. THEY NEED TO KNOW WHAT TO EXPECT WHEN THEY FIRST WALK INTO THE VOTING BOOTH. IT'S NO LONGER ENOUGH TO JUST SIMPLY REGISTER VOTERS WE NEED TO LITERALLY TEACH YOUNG PEOPLE THE MECHANICS OF VOTING AND DIDN'T DEMYSTIFY THE ENTIRE ELECTRICAL ELECT WORLD PROCESS.

HOWEVER FROM THE STATE REPRESENTS BECTIVE -- THE SUPERINTENDENT BELIEVES WE CAN DO MORE TO SUPPORT OUR SCHOOLS AND EDUCATING STUDENTS ABOUT VOTE THE VOTING PROCESS MANY OF THESE NEW VOTERS.

THE BALLOT AND VOTING PROCESS AB SEVEN SEVENTY THREE WILL ALLOW VOTERS WILL ALLOW STUDENTS TIME -- I'M SORRY.

COME ON DOWN YOU HAVE FILE ITEM TWELVE WHICH IS AB EIGHT TWENTY NINE BEGIN WHENEVER YOU'RE READY. THANK YOU GOOD MORNING MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS AB EIGHT TWENTY NINE PERMITS THE CS USED TO AWARD DOCTORATE DEGREES IN OCCUPATIONAL THERAPY. TO COMPLY WITH CHANGING PROFESSIONAL STANDARDS. OCCUPATIONAL THERAPISTS OR TEASE SUPPORT CHILDREN WITH LEARNING DISABILITIES PEOPLE RECOVERING FROM INJURIES. AND OLDER ADULTS EXPERIENCING COGNITIVE FIVE AND PHYSICAL CHANGES. AS WITH MANY HEALTHCARE PROFESSIONS CALIFORNIA HAS A SHORTAGE OF TEAS AND TO IN FACT RANKS FORTY FOURTH IN THE NATION IN ACCESS TO OCCUPATIONAL THERAPISTS. CURRENTLY SEVENTY SIX OF THE NINETY SIX OCCUPATIONAL THERAPY MASTER'S DEGREE PROGRAMS IN THE COUNTRY ARE TRANSITIONING TO A DOCTORATE DEGREE PROGRAM. INCLUDING ALL OF CALIFORNIA'S PRIVATE PROGRAMS. SO AB EIGHT TWENTY NINE WILL PROVIDE CALIFORNIANS WITH AN AFFORDABLE OPTION AT THE CS USE FOR STUDENTS PURSUING A CAREER IN OCCUPATIONAL THERAPY. THE COST OF ATTENDANCE AT THE CSU FOR AN OCCUPATIONAL THERAPY DEGREE IS FOUR TIMES LESS. THAN THE AT THE STATE'S PRIVATE INSTITUTIONS IN WITH A PROJECTED GROWTH OF AN IN EMPLOYMENT BY OUR ABILITY TO OFFER THESE PUBLIC PROGRAMS WILL GREATLY IMPACT THE SUPPLY OF HIGHLY SOUGHT AFTER HEALTH CARE SPECIALISTS. TO TESTIFY AB DR TERRY PERALTA THE CHAIR OF DEPARTMENT OF OCCUPATIONAL THERAPY AT CSU DOMINGUEZ HILLS. AND MAGGIE WHITE WITH THE CSU OFFICE OF THE CHANCELLOR. ASSEMBLYMEMBER BEGIN WHEN YOU'RE READY.

YES GOOD MORNING EVERYONE -- MY NAME IS SAID DR TERRY BROUGHT THE GOT THE POINT I CHAIRED OCCUPATIONAL THERAPY DEPARTMENT AT CAL STATE DOMINGUEZ HILLS FOR TEN YEARS NOW. I'VE BEEN AN OCCUPATIONAL THERAPIST FOR TWENTY YEARS I'M REALLY HAPPY TO BE HERE BECAUSE I REALLY FEEL THAT CALIFORNIA'S DESERVE -- PUBLIC ACCESS ACCESS TO PUBLICLY FUNDED ADVANCED EDUCATION AND OCCUPATIONAL THERAPY. AS YOU KNOW THE CSU HAS THE ONLY PUBLIC BACK TO CARRIER IN OCCUPATIONAL THERAPY IN THE STATE. IN BETWEEN THE TWO PROGRAMS OF THE MINGUS HILLS INSANITY STATE WE CURRENTLY GRADUATE 30% OF THE OCCUPATIONAL THERAPIST EDUCATED IN CALIFORNIA. OUR GRADUATES HAVE A NINETY SEVEN AT LEAST PASS RATE ON THE NATIONAL CERTIFICATION EXAM. THIS AUTHORITY WOULD ALLOW US TO CONTINUE THE GREAT SUCCESS OF OUR MASTERS LEVEL PROGRAMS. AND ARE VITAL COMMUNITY PARTNERSHIP WHILE MEETING THE WORK FORCE DEMAND FOR DOCTORATE LEVEL EDUCATION AND SPECIALIZATION. ACROSS THE NATION 80% OF MASTER'S PROGRAMS ARE CURRENTLY TRANSITIONING TO OFFERING A DOCTORATE TO MEET THE DEMAND FOR THIS LEVEL OF EDUCATION. AS EVIDENCED BY THE MANY LETTERS OF SUPPORT SUBMITTED BY OUR COMMUNITY PARTNERS WHICH INCLUDE ALAMEDA HEALTH SYSTEM TORRANCE MEMORIAL MEDICAL CENTER AND MANY OTHER REGIONAL CLINICS BUT FOCUS ON SPECIALTY CARE. ARE CSU STUDENTS ARE HARD WORKING HIGHLY SKILLED AND EAGER TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE IN THEIR COMMUNITIES. WE BELIEVE THE HEALTHCARE FOR WORK FOR SHOULD REFLECT OUR POPULATION THAT'S WHY AND AFFORDABLE PUBLIC DEGREE IS SO IMPORTANT NOT JUST FOR STUDENTS BUT FOR THE STATE. THE COST OF TUITION OF CALIFORNIA'S PRIVATE MASTER'S PROGRAMS IN OCCUPATIONAL THERAPY RANGES FROM 850-002-10030. THREE THOUSAND AT CSU THE TOTAL COST OF TUITION FOR A TWO AND A HALF YEAR MASTERS PROGRAM IS ROUGHLY. NINETEEN THOUSAND WE ANTICIPATE THAT THE DOCTORATE LEVEL DEGREE% YOU WOULD CONTINUE TO BRING SIGNIFICANT COST SAVINGS TO OUR STUDENTS.

THIS BILL IS PROPOSING A COMMONSENSE FIX TO THE COMMUNICABLE IS FUNDING FORMULA FORMULA THAT WE ADOPTED LAST YEAR. TO ADDRESS THE UNIQUE SITUATION FACING COMMUNITY COLLEGES WITH PUBLIC SAFETY TRAINING PROGRAMS FOR FIREFIGHTERS AND LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS. ALMOST HALF OF ALL COULD CALIFORNIA COMMITTEE CALLS DISTRICTS HAVE INSTRUCTIONAL SERVICE AGREEMENTS WITH THEIR LOCAL PUBLIC SAFETY AGENCIES. TO PROVIDE OVER FIFTEEN THOUSAND FIREFIGHTERS AND LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS WITH ONGOING PROFESSIONAL TRAINING. LAST YEAR THE LEGISLATURE APPROVED A NEW COMMUNICATIONS FUNDING FORMULA THAT UNFORTUNATELY PROVIDES LESS FUNDING FOR THESE PUBLIC SAFETY TRAINING PROGRAMS. AB SEVEN TWENTY CALLS FOR THESE PUBLIC SAFETY PROGRAMS TO BE FUNDED OUTSIDE OF THE NEW FUNDING FORMULA SO THAT WE CAN SUPPORT OUR FIRST RESPONDERS WITH THE TRADING THAT THEY NEED.

IT WAS WITH THE EMOTIONAL SUPPORT OF MY FAMILY PEERS A MOTIVATED ME TO WORK HARD AND ALLOW ME TO GET ACCEPTED INTO THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA -- I REMEMBER SPENDING COUNTLESS NIGHTS STUDYING FOR AN UPCOMING EXAM AND MY PARENTS ARE MADE WITH ME THERE BY MY SIDE AND REFLECTING NOW. IT WAS THEIR SUPPORT THAT THAT HELPED ME AND MOTIVATED ME. TO TAKE TO GET PAST LIKE UP. THE OUTSIDE DISTRACTIONS AND WHAT FOCUS ON MY SCHOOL WORK AND THE HELP ME BECOME A BETTER PERSON AS WELL AS A BETTER STUDENT. AND I KNOW THE SAME CAN BE SAID FOR MANY OF MY PEERS AND THEY AND THE WHOLE POINT OF THIS IS THAT. A CHOIR THE AMERICAN DREAM AND WE DO THIS AS US LET ME KNOW IMMIGRANTS ETCETERA WE DO THIS THROUGH THE A.. THROUGH EDUCATION AND BY ALLOWING THE WHAT THE FAMILIES TO PAY TO GET THEIR CHILDREN INTO UC'S THEY TAKES LOCKED AWAY FROM HARD WORKING STUDENTS. COMING FROM DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE ON THIS BILL. THANK YOU NEXT WITNESS. GOOD MORNING CHAIR ELEVEN COMMITTEE MEMBERS FIRST AND FOREMOST I WOULD LIKE TO THINK THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER MCCARTY IN THE COMMITTEE FOR THEIR TIME THIS MORNING AND ALLOW ME TO SPEAK ON TESTIMONY BEHALF OF THE UCLA COMMUNITY. AND MARGINALIZE STUDENTS AS A WHOLE AT THE CORE A. B. THIRTEEN EIGHTY THREE IS DESIGNED TO ENSURE THAT EVERY STUDENT IS ABLE TO RECEIVE A FAIR AND QUALITY EDUCATION WITHOUT FEAR HAVING THEIR MISSIONS OPPORTUNITIES WINDOW BY SYSTEM DESIGNED TO SERVE THE PRIVILEGED FEW. MY EXPERIENCE AT UCLA DURING BOTH MY UNDERGRADUATE AND GRADUATE TENURE SERVES AS AN EXAMPLE OF THE BENEFITS OF AN ISSUES SUCH AS AFFIRMATIVE ACTION CAN DO TO SERVE UNDER REPRESENTED COMMUNITIES. AS AFRICAN AMERICAN STUDENT UCLA I WAS A MINUTE IN PART THROUGH THE AFFIRMATIVE ACTION INITIATIVE WITH THE SUPPORT OF THE ACADEMIC ADVANCEMENT PROGRAM AT UCLA WHICH IS THE NATION'S LARGEST UNIVERSITY BASED STUDENT DIVERSITY PROGRAM. AND GOAL IS TO CREATE ANY MINISTER INNOVATIVE ACADEMIC PROGRAMS FIRST GENERATION LOW INCOME AND STUDENTS WHO HAVE BEEN HISTORICALLY UNDERREPRESENTED IN HIGHER EDUCATION. THE FACT THAT THE STUDENT CAN BE EMITTED MERELY BASED ON THE INCOME LEVEL OR SOCIAL PRIVILEGES MORALLY GROTESQUE AND REINFORCES THEIR HISTORIC OPPRESSION OF MARGINALIZED COMMUNITIES IN THIS GREAT STATE. FOR EVERY STUDENT HAS PAID THEIR WAY THROUGH A SPECIAL MISSION THERE'S A FULLY QUALIFIED PERHAPS MARGINALIZE STUDENT WHOSE WORK TWICE AS HARD TO GET TO WHERE THEY ARE ACADEMICALLY AND DOES HAVE BEEN DISENFRANCHISED FROM AN ADMISSION OPPORTUNITY. TO PRESERVE THEIR ACADEMIC GOALS I CAN ATTEST TO THE DEATH INSIDE AN OPTIMISM WITHIN EACH BREWING ESPECIALLY BROWN'S A COLOR. EVERY STUDENT SHOULD BE IN DOUBT WITH THE ENABLE BE OVER INALIENABLE RIGHT TO A QUALITY EDUCATION WITHOUT PEER DISENFRANCHISEMENT AB THIRTEEN EIGHTY THREE DOES JUST THAT. THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA SHOULD LEAD BY EXAMPLE FOR THIS NATION JUST AS WE HAVE DONE TIME AND TIME AGAIN HI IMPLORED THE COMMITTEE TO VOTE BY ON A. B. THIRTEEN EIGHTY THREE AS IT WILL ENSURE EVERY STUDENT. HAS THE SAME ACCESS TO A QUALITY EDUCATION TO CONTRIBUTE TO OUR EVER MORE DIVERSE COMMUNITIES. THANK YOU YOU TELL ME THE GREAT ON TIME ABOUT A MINUTE LEFT. YES GO AHEAD. MORNING SENATORS MY NAME'S ELIZABETH I'M CURRENTLY A STUDENT AT UC DAVIS AND SO IN ORDER TO YOU GET INTO UC DAVIS I HAD TO BE BOTH OF JESUS ACADEMICALLY AND THEIR EXTRACURRICULAR IS. NOT ONLY WAS ACHIEVING HIGH GRADES IN THE HARDEST CLASSES AT MY SCHOOL I ALSO HAD TO DO SPORTS YEAR ROUND CITED VOLLEYBALL YEAR ROUND ON TOP OF WORKING VOLUNTEERING AT ANIMAL SHELTERS SENIOR LIVING COMMUNITIES. AND I ALSO TUTORED A CHILD WITH AUTISM SO I HAD TO DO ALL OF THAT. IN ORDER TO PROVE MYSELF WORTHY OF BEING ACCEPTED AND SO WHEN SOMEONE ELSE IS ABLE TO PAY THEIR WAY AND THEY'RE TAKING SPOT FROM SOMEONE. WHO HAS WORKED SO HARD FOR SO MANY YEARS AND DOESN'T GET THAT CHANCE? VERY WELL SAID -- HARD WORKING YOUNG WOMAN. IS THERE A DIGITAL SUPPORT. OF THE THIRTY MEN RIGHT WITH THE CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY WHEN I THINK THE AUTHOR FOR TAKING A MOMENT TODAY TO MINIMIZE THE BILL'S IMPACT ON OUR E. O. P. PARTICIPANTS. WE MAINTAIN A NEUTRAL POSITION THANK YOU THANK YOU. OUR REGULAR ME AFTER THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA WE ALSO APPRECIATE THE AMENDMENTS TAKEN BY THE AUTHORS OFFICE -- WE HAVE -- ONE PARTICULAR WORD THAT'S WE THINK WE CAN WORK OUT BUT I THINK WE'LL BE IN A POSITION WHERE THE BILLS ARE GOING TO BE AN ISSUE FOR US SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH. VERY GOOD THANK YOU. HI NOELLE MORE A STUDENT AT SAC STATE AND BOARD MEMBER FOR ALLIANCE FOR EDUCATION SOLUTIONS IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL. VERY GOOD ANYONE ELSE WANT TO RUN UP FOR SUPPORT. ALRIGHT IS THERE ANY OPPOSITION TO THE BILL. CNN WILL BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE. SENATOR PAN. THAT'S IT THANK YOU A CENTER CARD FOR BRING THIS BILL FORD I AM CURIOUS AND OUT OF YOU KNOW THE ANSWER SO -- THE PEOPLE GUIDED BEFORE UNDER THE EXCEPTION WHO HAD TO SIGN ON OFF OF IT BEFORE WAS A JUST A COACH OR I MEAN THAT YOU USUALLY THINK LIKE IN A MISSION AS AN ADMISSIONS COMMITTEE IT'S VERY DELIVER IT AND AND SOMEONE THOUGHT REALLY CAREFULLY OF ABOUT IT. I MEAN WHO WHO ACTUALLY DECIDED BEFORE. SENSUALLY WAS THE COACH AND IT WITHOUT A COACH AT WORST THAT WOULD THAT WERE BRIGHT -- FRAUDULENT MEANS AND SO THIS WOULD BRING SAM FRANKLY COMMONSENSE CHECKS AND BALANCES AND HAVE A SENIOR LEVEL ADMINISTRATOR HAVE A SECONDARY SENATE. YOU WOULD THINK THAT THIS SCAM WOULD NEVER HAPPEN AGAIN BECAUSE OF WHAT WAS. UNCOVERED THIS SPRING BUT YOU NEVER KNOW SO I THINK IT LOCK IT IN CALIFORNIA POLICY TO MAKE SURE WE HAVE -- ADEQUATE OVERSIGHT AND THIS IS WHAT THIS IS ALL ABOUT WELL I APPRECIATE I MEAN I THE FACT THAT AND AGAIN WE HAVE A LOT OF VERY TALENTED COACHES ATHLETIC DIRECTORS BUT THEY WOULD ACTUALLY HAVE. ESSENTIALLY THE ALMOST SOUL SAY ON AN ADMISSION OF A STUDENT. AS THERE'S A LITTLE CONCERNING I MEAN IT THAT THE THE ACADEMIC TEAM THE PEOPLE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE ACADEMIC SHOULD BE THE ONES MAKING DECISIONS ON ADMISSION CERTAINLY TEAM TO TAKE CARE OF LOTS OF DIFFERENT FACTORS BUT ALSO TO ISSUE RESPONSIBILITY. TO RIGHT ONE TO ADMIT THE PERSON THE UNIVERSITY IN THESE ARE PUBLIC UNIVERSITIES WERE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE STUDENTS AND SO THE IDEA THAT -- YOU DON'T HAVE A SENIOR ADMINISTRATOR SOMEONE WHO HELD TO BASICALLY SAY WE ARE ACCEPTING RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE EDUCATION OF TE STUDENT -- IS IS IS -- ESPECIALLY WHEN IT'S FOR AN EXCEPTION I THINK IS IS CONCERNING SO CERTAINLY -- STRONG SUPPORT YOUR BILL AND WOULD MOVE AT THE PROPER TIME. THANK YOU CENTER PAN ANYONE ELSE ASSEMBLYMEMBER WHICH I TO CLOSE. THANK YOU I APPRECIATE THE THE DISCUSSION IT'S REALLY MIND BLOWING TO THINK THAT AN INDIVIDUAL COULD APPLY TO MAYBE -- GO TO A SCHOOL AND AND PARTICIPATE ON THE WATER POLO TEAM AND THE COACH COULD SIGN OFF SAYING THIS PERSON'S AN EXCEPTIONAL WATER POLO PLAYER AND LITERALLY IS NO VERIFICATION THAT STUDENT EVEN KNOWS HOW TO SWIM. AND SO THIS IS WHAT WE'RE ATTEMPTING TO ADDRESS IT'S A COMMON SENSE MEASURE AND ASK THE RIVAL THANK YOU. ASSEMBLYMEMBER THE BILL HAS BEEN MOVED BY SENATOR PAN MA'AM SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL.

MOVING UP THE DEGREE STANDARDS. RIGHT SO NOW WE HAVE A SITUATION WHERE THE UNIVERSITIES IF THEY'RE GOING TO GRADUATE PEOPLE IN THESE FIELDS HAVE BEEN TRAIN A LONG TIME THEY NOW HAVE TO DO YOU KNOW MATT. MASTERS TO DR IT'S RIGHT. AND SO ON ONE LEVEL AND ARE STAND WHY THE UNIVERSITIES ARE HERE SEE ISSUES HERE TO BE COLLEGES COME HERE AND SAY WE NEED TO BUILD DO THESE ADDITIONAL DEGREES -- BECAUSE THEY'VE TRADITIONALLY DONE THE TRAINING FOR THOSE HEALTH PROFESSIONS BUT I AM CONCERNED ABOUT WHY CALL THIS CREDENTIAL CREED. AND WHAT'S US ALSO SAYS YOU THE CREDENTIAL CREE BY THE WAY IS WHEN YOU DO IT DR ED ARE YOU DO A MASTERS WAS FEES A BACHELORS ARE NOW MASTERS THAT BECOMES A DOCTORATE. IT GETS MORE EXPENSIVE THERE'S MORE BARRIERS NOW TO PEOPLE ENTERING THOSE FIELDS AS WELL SO A CERTAINLY I VOTED FOR THIS BILL I VOTED FOR SOME PREVIOUS BILLS. THAT I REALIZE IS A LARGER CONVERSATION AND IT'S ALSO INCORPORATES AND IT'S NOT YOU KNOW WE DON'T HAVE OVERSIGHT OVER THE INDIVIDUAL PROFESSIONAL ASSOCIATIONS THAT ARE DRIVING THIS. I AM VERY CONCERNED THAT WE HAVE THIS CREDENTIAL CREEP THAT'S GOING ON I SEE THIS ALSO MY OWN FEEL THE MEDICINE. AND THIS IS CREATING GREATER BARRIERS TO PEOPLE BOTH ENTERING THE FIELD THAT INCREASE ACCESS ISSUES SO I JUST FELT LIKE I HAD TO SAY SOMETHING ABOUT IT I WASN'T HERE FOR THE PRESENTATION BUT I'VE SAID THIS BEFORE SOME OTHER ONES AND IT IS SOMETHING I AM CONCERNED ABOUT.

THE STATE PARTY REQUIRE SCHOOLS TO RECOGNIZE -- THESE INDIVIDUALS NAMES FOR GENDER CHANGES -- WITH COURT ORDERS AND TO UPDATE THEIR PERMANENT RECORD -- THIS BILL WOULD SIMPLY CLOSE A GAP IN THE LAW TO ENSURE THAT STUDENTS WHO MAY HAVE COME OUT AFTER LEAVING SCHOOL.

THANK YOU -- MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS I'M PROUD TO PRESENT AB THIRTEEN THIRTEEN WHICH SIX TWENTY SURE THAT A STUDENT'S FUTURE IS NOT HELD HOSTAGE BY COLLEGES. THIS BILL PROHIBITS POST SECONDARY SCHOOLS FROM REFUSING TO PROVIDE A TRANSCRIPT IN ORDER TO COLLECT A DEBT -- COLLEGE TRANSCRIPTS ARE CRITICAL DOCUMENTS THEY GIVE STUDENTS MOBILITY -- TO PURSER HIGHER EDUCATION A PROFESSIONAL LICENSE AND EMPLOYMENT. OF CURRENT STATE LAW AND EDUCATIONAL POLICY ALLOW SCHOOLS TO WITHHOLD TRANSCRIPTS IN ORDER TO COLLECT A DEBT. OF SCHOOLS ARE PUTTING STUDENTS IN A PREDICAMENT WHERE THEY ARE UNABLE TO ADVANCE THEIR CAREERS AND GET TO A PLACE WHERE THEY CAN ACTUALLY PAY OFF THIS DEBT. OUR NATIONAL STUDENT LOAN DEBT EXCEEDS ONE POINT FIVE TRILLION DOLLARS TODAY THIS AMOUNT EXCEEDS ALL OUTSTANDING CREDIT CARD DEBT IN OUR COUNTRY. AND SAY INSTEAD OF MAKING IT MORE DIFFICULT -- WE SHOULD BE DOING EVERYTHING WE CAN TO REDUCE THE BURDEN OF PAIN THESE DEBTS OFF -- SO TO FURTHER SPEAK ON THIS BILL I HAVE A FEW WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. ON BEHALF OF THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE WHICH IS THE SPONSOR OF THIS BILL I'M HAPPY TO INTRODUCE MARTIN -- READ DOSE WHICH SORRY. AND BERNARD -- IS CAN DARI. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY WOMAN GENTLEMEN WELCOME TWO MINUTES EACH [inaudible] MEMBERS. MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS OF MARTIN RIAZ WHICH WITH THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S PROUD TO SPONSOR A. B. THIRTEEN THIRTEEN WHICH RESTRICTS POST SECONDARY SCHOOLS FROM THE PRACTICE OF WITHHOLDING. A STUDENT TRANSCRIPTS AS A MEANS FOR DEBT COLLECTION WE ALSO WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR INTRODUCING THIS BILL I HAVE BARNEY ASKING DOREY HE'S A SUPERVISING DEPUTY ATTORNEY GENERAL THEIR CONSUMER LAW SECTION WITH ME. WHO CAN DISCUSS THE NEED FOR THE BILL IN MORE DETAIL AND ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE? THANK YOU PLEASE PROCEED THANK YOU -- GOOD AFTERNOON NOW -- MY NAME IS BERNARD ASKING DARI BARNEY I'M SUPERVISING DEPUTY ATTORNEY GENERAL THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE. ON THE TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF ECONOMIC POTENTIAL IS LOCKED UP IN A STUDENTS COLLEGE TRANSCRIPT. TRANSCRIPTS ARE OFTEN THE CRITICAL DOCUMENT NECESSARY FOR SOMEONE TO TRANSFER TO ANOTHER SCHOOL TO OBTAIN A PROFESSIONAL LICENSE OR EVEN TO GET A JOB. BECAUSE THESE DOCUMENTS ARE SO IMPORTANT TO STUDENTS LIVELIHOOD THE ALSO MAKE A POTENT DEBT COLLECTION TOOL A PRACTICE THAT SOME OF CALLED TRANSCRIPT EXTORTION. WE SAW THIS FIRST HAND IN THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S PROSECUTION INVESTIGATION OF CORINTHIAN COLLEGES WHICH WENT OUT OF BUSINESS SHORTLY AFTER WE SUED THEM. CLINTON IS CONSIDERED AMONG THE WORST OF THE WORST A PREDATORY SCHOOLS DEFRAUDING STUDENTS AT EVERY TURN -- TWENTY IN STRONG ARMS STUDENTS INTO PAYING BACK THAT'S WITH A NUMBER OF A PRESS OF TACTICS -- THIS INCLUDED FOR EXAMPLE PULLING STUDENTS OUT OF CLASS TO BERATE THEM IN THE MIDDLE -- DURING INSTRUCTION IT ALSO INCLUDED WITHHOLDING TRANSCRIPTS TO PREVENT STUDENTS FROM FLEEING CORINTHIAN TO CONTINUE THEIR EDUCATION AND MORE LEGITIMATE INSTITUTIONS ARE ACTUALLY LEGITIMATE INSTITUTIONS. OUR EXPERIENCE INVESTIGATING AND PROSECUTING FOR PROFIT SCHOOLS IS WHAT PROMPTED THE ATTORNEY GENERAL TO SPONSOR THIS BILL. UNFORTUNATELY THE STRONG ARM TACTICS ARE NOT CONFINED JUST A PREDATORY SCHOOLS LEGITIMATE INSTITUTIONS ROUTINELY WITH WHOLE TRANSCRIPTS AS WELL. WITHHOLDING TRANSCRIPTS INTERFERES WITH STUDENT CHOICE INTERFERES WITH STUDENT MOBILITY AND THEREFORE IT HARMS COMPETITION AMONG SCHOOLS. IT DOES SO IN A WAY THAT THREATENS THE LIVELIHOOD OF STUDENTS BY BLOCKING FURTHER EDUCATION LICENSURE AND PLACEMENT. THE VERY THINGS WOULD ALLOW STUDENTS TO SUCCEED AND MAKE ENOUGH MONEY TO PAY BACK THEIR DEBTS. WHICH IS WHY THIS BILL IS SO IMPORTANT SCHOOLS ALREADY HAVE ALL THE DATA COLLECTION TOOLS THAT ON SECURED CREDITORS HAVE. IN OUR EXPERIENCE THE PRACTICE OF SCHOOLS WITHHOLDING TRANSCRIPTS IT'S SIMPLY TOO BIG OF AN ADDITIONAL HAMMER. THANK YOU AND I'M HAPPY ANSWERING QUESTIONS THANK YOU VERY MUCH ADDITIONAL WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. THE MANAGER WITH THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNICABLE JUST CHANCES OFFICE IN SUPPORT THANK YOU. THANK YOU IS THERE ANY OPPOSITION TO THE BILL. WELCOME TO YOU EACH HAVE TWO MINUTES ALL EVEN DECIDE WHO GOES FIRST. THANK YOU COMMITTEE -- IN MEMBERS MY NAME'S TYLER I YOU ARE SEEKING ON BEHALF OF THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA. IS ONE OF THE BIG KNOWLEDGE AND THANK THE AUTHOR IN THE SPONSOR WE DEFINITELY UNDERSTAND -- WHERE THEY'RE COMING FROM WITH THIS ISSUE WE WE UNDERSTAND THAT THERE IS A AMOUNT TEEN STUDENT DEBT CRISIS THAT EXISTS IN CALIFORNIA AND THE UNITED STATES? AND WE WILL CONTINUE OUR WORK TO PRIORITIZE THAT AFFORDABILITY ACCESS THAT WE PROVIDE TO YOU SEE WE ALSO SHARE THE AUTHOR'S INTEREST IN PROTECTING. STUDENTS AND CONTROLLING DEBT COLLECTION ABUSES BY -- SOME OF THE BAD ACTORS THAT WE HAD HEARD -- IN THE TESTIMONY THE PRACTICE OF WITHHOLDING TRANSCRIPTS THAT YOU SEE FOR DELINQUENT ACCOUNTS IS A FAIRLY COMMON -- TOOL THAT WE USE TO US -- RECOUP OUTSTANDING FINES -- TO THE UNIVERSITY. THIS IS THE TOOLS. BUT I CAMPUS IS PRIMARY LEVERAGE YOUR DISTANCE INTO A CONVERSATION ABOUT HOW THEY CAN PAY BACK THE DEBT THEY OWE -- WITH THEIR DUE DILIGENCE AND SURVEYED ALL OF OUR CAMPUS REGISTRARS WE JUST ASK THAT WHAT EXACTLY HAPPENS WHEN A STUDENT IS TRYING TO ACCESS. A TRANSCRIPT AND THEY OWE A DEBT TO THE UNIVERSITY ALL OF OUR CAMPUSES. ALL OF THEM WILL WORK WITH A STUDENT WHO IS TRYING TO ATTAIN A TRANSCRIPT FOR ACADEMIC OR WORK RELATED PURPOSES. SOME EXAMPLES FOR EXAMPLE -- WHEN CAMPUS WILL DO -- ONE TIME RELEASE -- IF THEY GIVE THE EMAIL OF THE EMPLOYER HAD ALSO DIRECTED EMPLOYER OTHER CAMPUSES LET'S SAY THE AMOUNT IS TWO FIFTY THE REQUIRED A TWENTY FIVE DOLLAR DOWN PAYMENT AND I'LL TRY TO FIGURE OUT A REASONABLE. PAYMENT PLAN GOING FORWARD SO THE THE GOAL HERE IS TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE NOT BURNING THE STUDENT OR PROHIBITING THEM FROM -- MEETING WITH THEIR EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES OF THEIR EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITIES. THAT IS NOT OUR GOAL OUR CAMPUS REGISTRARS HAVE EXTREME FLEXIBILITY TO TREAT STUDENTS IN A CASE BY CASE BASIS OF SOMEBODY'S COMING HERE AND THEY SAY YOU KNOW WE NEED. THIS TRANSCRIPT MUCH DRIVING JOB OFFER FOR FIFTY GRAND I CAN PAY BACK THE AMOUNT AND THREE MONTHS GREAT LET'S FIGURE OUT HOW TO DO IT. IN NO WAY WOULD WE PULL ANY STUDENTS OUT OF CLASS OR BE RATE THEM PUBLICLY OR WHATEVER MAY HAVE YOU -- WE WANT TO WORK WITH STUDENTS SO -- WE JUST ASK THAT WE CONTINUE. TO COLLECT DEBTS IN THIS METHOD WE THINK IT'S A BETTER OPTION THAN WHAT WE WOULD HAVE TO DO IS ACTUALLY SENDING THEM TO A THIRD PARTY COLLECTIONS AGENCY WHICH WE DO NOT WANT TO DEAL. THANK YOU NEXT WITNESS. GOOD AFTERNOON I THINK IT IS NOW -- ALEX GRAYS OF THE ASSOCIATION INDEPENDENT CALIFORNIA COLLEGES UNIVERSITIES REPRESENTING EIGHTY FOUR PRIVATE INDEPENDENT NOT FOR PROFIT INSTITUTIONS THROUGHOUT OUR STATE. I ALSO WANT TO THANK THE AUTHORS OFFICE AND THEIR STAFF I THINK WE'VE HAD THREE MEETINGS TO DISCUSS THIS BILL AND I APPRECIATE THE TIME AND AND THOUGHTFULNESS -- WE IS OUR WATER INDICATES HAVING OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED POSITION I THINK SIMILAR TO MY COLLEAGUE FROM YOU SEE WE FULLY SUPPORT THE IMPORTANCE OF YOU KNOW STUDENTS GETTING THEIR DEGREE. AND INTO THE WORK FORCE IN A TIMELY MANNER I WITH THIS LITTLE AS POSSIBLE -- YOU KNOW WE HAVE A TWO THIRDS ARE CAL GRANT STUDENTS GRADUATE IN FOUR YEARS -- WE HAVE VERY LOW DEFAULT RATES -- ON STUDENTS WHO DO TAKE OUT LOANS -- AND ON AVERAGE OUR SYSTEM OR PROVIDING ABOUT NINETEEN THOUSAND DOLLARS IN INSTITUTIONAL GRANT AID TO TO OUR CAL GRANT STUDENTS -- ARE UNDERSTAND IS CONCERNED -- THIS ISSUE STEMS FROM SOME PRETTY AGGRESSIVE TACTICS EMPLOYED BY SOME OF THE FOR PROFIT ENTITIES -- IN COLLECTING THESE DEBTS -- YOU KNOW WE BELIEVE THAT WE FUNDAMENTALLY AS NON PROFITS HAVE A DIFFERENT -- MISSION AN INCENTIVE IN EDUCATING STUDENTS OUR MISSION IS TO EDUCATE THOSE STUDENTS AND GET THEM DEGREES IT'S NOT TO MAKE MONEY OFF OF THEM -- YOU KNOW WE I WASN'T ABLE IS A DECENTRALIZED SYSTEM TO GET AN INPUT FROM ALL EIGHTY FOUR OF OUR SCHOOLS BUT I DID CONNECT ABOUT A DOZEN AND ACROSS THE BOARD DATE -- SOMEBODY C. TALKED ABOUT VARIOUS FORMS OF LENIENCY -- WITH OTHER TACTICS -- IS EXCUSE ME MECHANISMS THEY HAVE AT THEIR AVAILABILITY IN RECOGNITION OF THE FACT THEY WANT STUDENTS TO PROGRESS TOWARD THEIR DEGREE. SCHOOLS -- TALKED ABOUT THE FACT THAT THEY DON'T WITHHOLD REGISTRATION PRIVILEGES FOR STUDENTS WHO -- DEBT BECAUSE THEY RECOGNIZE YOU WANT THEM TO CONTINUE ON THE PATH TO THEIR DEGREE AND THEY CAN WORK WITH THEM IS ARE MOVING THROUGH THE SYSTEM TO WORK OUT ANY BAD. PAYMENT OF DEBT THEY THEY YOU KNOW ALSO MIGHT. NOT WITHHOLD ANY REGISTRATION OR WHAT HAVE YOU IF THE DEBT IS UNDER A HUNDRED DOLLARS -- THEY ALSO SOME SCHOOLS MENTION THAT THEY DON'T WITHHOLD THE CONFERRAL OF DEGREES WHICH IS ANOTHER ECHANISM AVAILABLE TO SCHOOLS FOR DEBT COLLECTION -- AND A NUMBER OF THEM YOU KNOW TALKED ABOUT VARIOUS COMMUNICATION METHODS OKAY I'LL SKIP TO THE END I WOULD JUST SAY THAT -- FOR COLLECTIONS ON THE BACK AND THE CHALLENGE FOR OUR SCHOOLS ESPECIALLY IS NOT FOR PROFITS IS -- WE LOSE 3550% OF THAT AMOUNT THROUGH THE NATURE HOW COLLECTIONS ARE ARE PAID -- AND SO GIVEN THAT OUR SCHOOLS THAT WE SURVEYED HAVE BETWEEN FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND AND AND UPWARDS OF FIVE TO EIGHTEEN MILLION DOLLARS IN UNPAID DEBT THAT'S SIGNIFICANT -- POTENTIAL COST TO OUR SCHOOLS AND TRYING TO CONTINUE TO PROVIDE REAL BY STATE SUPPORT FOR STUDENTS OF THANK YOU. THANK YOU. ANY ADDITIONAL OPPOSITION SEEING THAT WILL BRING BACK TO THE COMMITTEE QUESTIONS COMMENTS CONCERNS [inaudible] CENTER GLAZER. BUT I WANTED TO INVITE THE AUTHOR TO RESPOND TO THE SOME OF THE CONCERNS HAVE BEEN RAISED IN WHETHER OR NOT YOU SAW ANY REASON TO DIFFERENTIATE -- AND HOW YOUR BILL FAIL BUT COLLEGES YOUR BILL WOULD APPLY -- TO SURE OF YOU KNOW SO -- YOU KNOW THE APPROACH TAT THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES ARE TAKEN ARE TAKING IT REINFORCES THEIR MISSION RIGHT -- TO SUPPORT STUDENTS TO EDUCATE STUDENTS SO I WAS EXCITED TO SEE THAT THEY ARE SUPPORTING -- MY BILL -- I JUST RECEIVED THE LETTER FROM THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA YESTERDAY -- AND YOU KNOW THE FIRST THING -- THAT I DID WAS LOOK AT THEIR MISSION I'M YOU KNOW WHEN I WAS GROWING UP YOU KNOW THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA REPRESENTED. ON ACCESS TO ANYONE TO THOSE OF US THE GROUP IN LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES -- TO EDUCATION AND YOU KNOW I ALSO -- SAW STUDY YESTERDAY THAT YOU KNOW STUDENTS OF COLOR IN LOW INCOME GRADUATES ARE THREE TIMES MORE LIKELY TO TAKE ON STUDENT LOAN DEBT. AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SCHOOLS -- AND SO -- YOU KNOW IT DISAPPOINTED ME ARM TO SEE THE OPPOSITION -- I UNDERSTAND THAT THEY IN THEIR USING THIS TRANSCRIPT AS LEVERAGE BUT I THINK I LIKE WHAT THEY SAY IN THEIR LETTER IS THEY'RE USING THE TRANSCRIPT. TO START A CALM THE LEVERAGING OF THE TRANSCRIPT TO START THE CONVERSATION I THINK THERE ARE MANY WAYS AS EDUCATORS I'M TO START A CONVERSATION WITH STUDENTS -- THAT ARE HAVING TROUBLE PAYING THEIR DEBT -- I THINK -- YOU KNOW STUDENTS ARE YOU NEED THE OFFICIAL TRANSCRIPTS TO APPLY FOR SAY MEDICAL SCHOOL GRADUATE SCHOOL PROTECT POTENTIALLY JOBS AND THIS IS A LOT OF TIMES BEFORE THEY HAVE FINISHED THEIR DEGREE. YOU KNOW AS YOU KNOW GRADUATE SCHOOL APPLICATIONS ARE DUE JANUARY FIRST -- AND IF WE ARE WITH HOLDING THESE TRANSCRIPTS -- WERE NOT ALLOWING THEM -- TO MOVE FURTHER IN THEIR EDUCATION OR IN THEIR CAREER -- I THINK THE YOU KNOW FINANCIAL LITERACY IS IMPORTANT THAT SOMETHING THAT THE UNIVERSITIES -- CAN WORK WITH STUDENTS MAY BE REQUIRED THEM TO GO TO WORKSHOPS -- THAT WILL HELP THEM WITH THE STATE AND PAYMENT PLAN I DON'T THINK THAT THE TRANSCRIPTS LEVERAGING IS THE ONLY WAY TO HAVE A COME STATION WITH STUDENTS. WELL I I HAVE TO THE CHAIR I I CERTAINLY -- SUPPORT THE INTENTIONS OF YOUR BILL I MEAN -- A STUDENT THAT HAS GONE THROUGH SUCH EFFORTS AND TO AND TO HAVE THIS. PIECE OF PAPER WHICH IS SO CRITICAL BE HELD WITH TELL THIS IS A TRAGEDY AND SO I YOU AND AND IN GENERAL TERMS I AGREE WITH WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH THAT. IS OBVIOUSLY -- YOU KNOW IMPACT. IF YOU BELIEVE WHAT THE INS THESE INSTITUTIONS ARE SAYING. AT THE UC AND THEIR LETTER SAYS IT WILL COST THEM. TEN TO TWELVE MILLION DOLLARS ANNUALLY. AND THAT THERE'S NO FREE LUNCH OUT THERE RIGHT AND WE WOULDN'T WANT TO SEE THEM RAISE TUITION. AS AN EXAMPLE IS AN EXTREME EXAMPLE. IF THEY'RE NOT GETTING THE FUNDING THEY NEED TO TO PAY THE BILLS THEN WE HAVE TO FIND THE MONEY IN SOME OTHER WAY AND THAT PROBABLY APPLIES ACROSS THE BOARD SO -- IT'S IT'S A CHALLENGE TO HOW TO WEAVE AS THE GOOD GOALS THAT YOU'RE ADVANCE YOU KNOW YOU'RE PROPOSING AND THE BILL. IT RECOGNIZE THAT IF YOU'RE GONNA TAKE THIS TOOL WAY. YOU KNOW WHAT OTHER WHAT OTHER CHOICES REALLY ARE THERE AND WE HAVE TO ON THOSE CHOICES TO WRITE. IF YOU WANT TO SEND IT TO A DEBT COLLECTION AND WE HAVE NOW CREDIT ISSUE ON THAT PERSON'S -- NAME. FOR EIGHT YEARS INTO THE FUTURE THAT'S A CONSEQUENCE RIGHT AND YOU KNOW YOU DON'T WANT THAT EITHER. I I DON'T WANT IT I'M SURE YOU DON'T WANT IT EITHER SO. I'M JUST TRYING TO UNDERSTAND. HOW WE CAN ADVANCE YOUR COULD GOALS WITH THE WITH THE LEGITIMATE CONCERNS THAT ARE BEING RAISED -- YOU KNOW WE HAVE ASKED IN CONVERSATIONS WITH THE UNIVERSITIES WE HAVE ASKED THAT QUESTION WHAT OTHER TOOLS. ARE THERE BESIDES THIS SOMETHING THAT WILL -- YOU KNOW. PREVENT -- STUDENTS FROM THEIR FUTURE JOBS WHICH WILL HELP THEM PAY THE STAT OFF -- AND I HAVEN'T RECEIVED RESPONSES -- IN IN WORKING THROUGH THIS BILL AND THIS BILL DOESN'T PROHIBIT UNIVERSITIES FROM COLLECTING THAT. IT JUST PROHIBITS THEM FROM USING THE TRANSCRIPT -- TO COLLECT THE DEBT ONE LAST QUESTION THAT I'M SURE IF I COULD PLEASE THE ANY GIVEN ANY THOUGHT TO THE TO ANY KIND OF DIFFERENTIAL IF THE DEBT IS UNDER THREE HUNDRED DOLLARS. IF THE DAD IS OUTSTANDING FOR MORE THAN. TWO YEARS IF. IS THERE ANYTHING THAT CAN CREATE SOME. PLACES FOR THE INSTITUTIONS TO WORK AND TRY TO DEAL WITH THE EGREGIOUS EXAMPLES -- ANY THOUGHTS TO TRYING TO FIND A WAY TO NARROW -- TAKE WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO TO DO BUT NOT GETTING IN THE WAY OF OF THEM TRYING. TO PAY THE BILLS RIGHT THAT KEEP THE LIGHTS ON ARE YOU KNOW I'VE THOUGHT OF THE RIGHT FEEL LIKE AN A PARTICULAR MON IT'S HARD TO DETERMINE RIGHT NOW THE UNIVERSITIES. DON'T COLLECT DATA ON YOU KNOW HOW MANY -- OUTSTANDING DEBTS THEY'RE USING -- I'VE ASKED FOR IT AND I HAVEN'T RECEIVED THAT -- IN I DON'T KNOW WHERE THE NUMBERS ARE COMING FROM THE TEN TO TWELVE MILLION I MEAN IN THE SAME HEARING WE'RE HEARING ABOUT STUDENT HOMELESSNESS -- STUDENT HUNGER -- IN EITHER OTHER ISSUES THAT ARE ARE LEGISLATOR CURRENTLY IS TACKLING ON AND WE WE EVEN IN OUR CURRENT STATE BUDGET WE ALLOCATED FUNDS -- FOR COLLEGES TO DEAL WITH HUNGER AND HOMELESSNESS RATE -- SOMETHING THAT THEY HAVE REQUESTED AND YOU KNOW WE REALLY BELIEVE IN THOSE ISSUES AND WE'RE HELPING THEM BUT AT THE SAME TIME -- I THINK THIS IS OF IT'LL LOOK YOU KNOW YOU ALSO. PUTTING STUDENTS MORE MORE IN -- IN. IN A PREDICAMENT WHERE THEY CAN'T MOVE ON EITHER TRANCE FOR TRANSFER OR YOU KNOW. GO TO GRADUATE SCHOOL OR A CAREER -- I JUST DON'T SEE HOW THE SAME UNIVERSITIES ARE. ASKING US FOR FUNDS -- TO DEAL% WITH HUNGER AND HOMELESSNESS BUT THEN YET ARE ALSO PART OF THE PROBLEM. ENTER MY OWN TIME THEN LIKE IT'S SOME UP YOU CAN BE ON ANYBODY'S TIME GO AHEAD [inaudible] THANK YOU -- WELL FIRST I I DO WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING THE BILL FORD AND I'M THAT SUPPORT THE BILL TODAY BUT I I WOULD ASK YOU TO TO TAKE A CLOSER LOOK AT WAYS IN WHICH YOU CAN NARROW IT WHICH IS NEVER AN EASY THING. BUT TO TRY TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THAT THESE INSTITUTIONS CERTAINLY THE NON PROFITS AND OUR PUBLIC INSTITUTIONS ARE NOT. TRYING TO BE MEAN BUT THEY ARE TRYING TO PAY THE BILLS AND AND AND THERE'S A BALANCING ACT HERE WHICH I KNOW YOU'RE TRYING TO FIND THAT SPACE. FOR I HOPE THAT YOU'LL WORK WITH THEM -- AS IF YOUR BILL GOES FORWARD TODAY TO TRY TO SEE IF YOU CAN FIGURE THAT OUT AND NARROW IT. AND FINALLY I'M HAPPY TO SEE THE OFFICE OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL HERE ON THIS BILL -- YOU KNOW THERE'S ABOUT SIX OTHER. A FOR PROFIT BILLS THAT ARE HERE IN THE SENATE RIGHT NOW. AND I IS THE CHAIR OF A COMMITTEE THIS CAN HEAR SIX OF THEM -- THE NEXT WEEK OR SO I WOULD REALLY APPRECIATE YOUR INPUT ON THOSE AS WELL. DOES NOT TO BE IN A SPONSORSHIP ROLE BUT YOUR ADVICE AND EXPERTISE AND HOW WE DEAL WITH THE PROBLEMS THAT WE ARE SEEING. WITH HIS FOR PROFIT INSTITUTIONS AND I THINK WOULD BENEFIT FROM YOUR INPUT AS WE AS WE ARE. WITH YOUR SPONSORSHIP OF THIS BILL TODAY THANK YOU VENTURE THE CENTER GLAZER ASSEMBLY WOMAN WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE. THANK YOU -- YOU KNOW THERE I THINK. LIKE I MENTIONED BEFORE -- THIS BILL IS NOT PROHIBITING UNIVERSITIES FROM COLLECTING THAT IT'S JUST THE USE OF THE TRANSCRIPT TO LEVERAGE LIKE AS THEY SAY TO START THE CONVERSATION. I FEEL THERE ARE MANY WAYS -- AS EDUCATORS TO START A CONVERSATION WITH STUDENTS ON THESE ISSUES THESE ARE STUDENTS -- THAT ARE STILL DEVELOPING YOU KNOW I THINK STERN DEVELOPMENT ON THEIR YOUNG -- FIRST TIME OUT IN THE REAL WORLD FOR A LOT OF THEM -- THAT I THINK WE HAD WE NEED TO GO BACK TO THE MISSION OF THE UNIVERSITIES AND THINK HOW. AND SEE THIS AS AN EDUCATIONAL AND TEACHABLE MOMENT -- YOU KNOW -- I APPRECIATE -- THAT THE UC'S ARE WORKING WITH MY OFFICE AND THE A I CC YOU THE NONPROFIT UNIVERSITIES AND I WILL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THEM -- ON THIS BILL -- HOWEVER I BELIEVE THAT YOU KNOW SCHOOL SHOULD BE FOCUSING HAN HOW TO BEST SERVE OUR STUDENTS -- AND YOU KNOW LAST YEAR THERE WAS A BILL IN THE LEGISLATURE -- THAT WAS SIMILAR BUT WITH THE K. THROUGH TWELVE SYSTEM -- YOU KNOW ALL SCHOOL K. THROUGH TWELVE SCHOOLS WERE ALSO USING TRANSCRIPTS TO LEVERAGE -- IT'LL AND IN TO USE AGAINST FOR COLLECTING -- STUDENT DEBT -- I THINK WE NEED TO MOVE AWAY FROM THESE PUNITIVE PRACTICES -- AND INSTEAD -- EDUCATE OUR AND SO ON AB THIRTEEN THIRTEEN MAINTAINS A SCHOOL AND YOU KNOW MAKE ELEVATES AT HIGHER EDUCATION. IN OUR STATE -- THERE'S NOT A NUMBER OF TOOLS TO ADDRESS OUTSTANDING DEBT BUT I BELIEVE WE NEED TO EVOLVE AND HOW WE APPROACH ON COLLECTING THE STAT IN.
