MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS -- SB SEVEN FIFTEEN SUPPORTS THE CREATION OF LOCAL JOBS BY ALLOWING CONSTRUCTION APPRENTICES WHO OPERATE HEAVY EQUIPMENT AND CRANES. THE CONTINUED OPPORTUNITY TO LEARN THEIR TRADE AND FURTHER THEIR CAREERS. AS YOU KNOW THE CALIFORNIA STATE CARE BE HAS ADOPTED REGULATIONS IN AN EFFORT TO REDUCE CARBON EMISSIONS FROM IN USE OFF ROAD DIESEL FUEL VEHICLES. THANKS TO THESE MEASURES CALIFORNIA HASCUT ANTHROPOGENIC SOURCES OF BLACK CARBON EMISSIONS BY MORE THAN 90% SINCE THE NINETEEN SIXTIES. AND WILL CUT THEM AGAIN IN HALF BY. TWENTY TWENTY THE AIR BE HAS ACHIEVED THE SUCCESS AS WELL ALSO CAREFULLY BALANCING THE NEED FOR REASONABLE EXEMPTIONS FROM THE STANDARDS. STATE REGISTERED APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAMS USE OLDER HEAVY EQUIPMENT TO REPAIR EMPLOYEES FOR A CAREER IN THE CONSTRUCTION TRADES. IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT THE TRAINING EQUIPMENT AS YOU SICK SIGNIFICANTLY LESS THAN EQUIPMENT THAT IS USED ON A JOB SITE. I IT IS ESTIMATED THAT EQUIPMENT IS A IN TRAINING IS USE APPROXIMATELY TWO HUNDRED HOURS PER YEAR OR FOUR HOURS PER WEEK. AS COMPARED TO HEAVY EQUIPMENT USE ON THE JOB SITE ANYWHERE BETWEEN FIFTEEN HUNDRED AND THREE THOUSAND HOURS ANNUALLY. BUT THESE APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAMS -- THAT OPERATE THE CRANES HAD TO SPEND MILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN ORDER TO RETROFIT THEIR EQUIPMENT TO COMPLY WITH THE EXISTING REGULATIONS. THIS BILL SEEKS TO RELIEVE THOSE NOT NONPROFIT PROGRAMS FROM AN ADDITIONAL TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS IN EXPENSES -- WITH THE SIMILAR LOW USE EXEMPTION FOR VEHICLES OWNED AND OPERATED BY STATE REGISTERED NONPROFIT APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAMS SIMILAR TO JOB CORPS. A SIMILAR TO THE JOB CORPS EXEMPTION. IN THIS SCOPE OF THE OVERALL STATEWIDE EMISSIONS INVENTORY THE APPRENTICESHIP TRAINING FLEET IS THE DEMAND A MESS. CONTRIBUTOR BUT CRITICAL FOR CREATING THESE JOBS S. B. SEVEN FIFTEEN RESPECTS THE ACHIEVEMENT OF ENVIRONMENTAL GOALS. BUT ALSO WITH EMPLOYMENT CREATION. OF BOUNCING ALL THE NEEDS OF CALIFORNIA. I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE TODAY AND HERE TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF SB SEVENTEEN IS TEMPERAMENTS WHAT THE OPERATING ENGINEERS SOUTH OF THE US WITH CALIFORNIA BUILDING AND CONSTRUCTION TRADES COUNCIL. AND MAKE A SCRIPT SCOTT MARLA WITHDRAWAL CHO GREW. SORRY ABOUT THAT I KNEW IT'S GONNA TOP THAT UP [inaudible] THE PLEASE. BUT THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS THANKS FOR HEARING OR BILL THE SLAY TIME GIVING UP THIS BILL IT I THINK IT'S PRETTY STRAIGHTFORWARD IT'S AN ATTEMPT TO OF AN EXEMPTION ENJOYED BY -- FOLKS OF SUCH AS THE JOB CORPS OF THE ENTIRE AGRICULTURAL INDUSTRY AND UTILITIES AND A FIREFIGHTER APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAMS. THESE THESE ARE. PART TIME USE VEHICLES UP AND IN YOUR MEMBER THERE YOU SIGNIFICANT LESSON TRADITIONAL CONSTRUCTION EQUIPMENT AND AT LESS EXERTION RATES WE ARE ARE PRETTY SHIP TRAINING EQUIPMENT AVERAGES. ROUGHLY A HUNDRED FIFTY THREE HUNDRED HOURS YEARS IN USE AND IT LESS EXERTION GREAT SO LET'S ADMISSIONS IS WHAT THAT MEANS. UP. AND IN THE BILL IS CRAFTED FOR ONLY THOSE TRAINING PROGRAMS THAT ARE PART OF AN APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAMS SO THAT NARROWS THE USE OF VEHICLES BEING EXEMPTED ATOMIC -- ALSO ALSO IT'S WE BELIEVE THE THE EXHAUSTIVE DE MINIMUS COMPARED TO THE OVERALL UNIVERSE ARE REGULATED VEHICLE. UP AND IN. WHAT WE STRUGGLE WITH THIS REQUIREMENT OUR FLEETS HAVE TO BE DIVERSE FLEETS AND UNLIKE A CONTRACTOR WHERE THEY HAVE A COUPLE PIECE OF EQUIPMENT OR TRAINING REQUIREMENTS BECAUSE WE HAVE TO TRAIN APPRENTICES ON SEVERAL TYPES OF EQUIPMENT? HAVE TO HAVE A DIVERSE FLEET AND BECOMES A TOUGH REALLY TOUGH BALANCING ACT WHERE YOU WHERE YOU'RE MOVING EQUIPMENT IN AND OUT OF SERVICE TO ACHIEVE TRAINING REQUIREMENTS AND TRAINING NEEDS. AND IT IN THE THIRD JOINT LABOR MANAGEMENT PROGRAMS KELLY. IT'S AWESOME MANAGE IT WORKING OTHER TO FIGURE OUT THE NEED TO THE FUTURE AN THAN WHAT THERE ARE PRESSING NEED TO BE TRAINED UP. TO IT TO MAKE IT TO MAKE THEM MORE EFFICIENT AND MORE SAFE -- AS AN EXAMPLE -- WE CURRENTLY HAVE SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA FLEET OF HUNDRED FOURTY FOUR VEHICLES FORTY ONE OF THOSE VEHICLES ARE PUT IN NINE YOU STATUS ARE LOW YOU STATUS. BECAUSE OF THE REGULATION AND WHAT IS THAT MEANS THAT MEANS OUR PRINCES HAVE LESS CHANCE TO TRAIN ON THIS EQUIPMENT IT'S LEAVING A HOLE IN OUR CURRICULUM. AND IT MAKES IT MAKES OUR OUR CONTRACTORS AND OUR WORKERS GENERAL LESS SAFE AND LEFT LEFT EXPERIENCE. OF IN IN IN AT ENTRANCE INTO -- WE SPENT FIVE TO SEVEN MILLION UPGRADES IN THE TWENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLAR BUDGET WE ANTICIPATE ANOTHER. SIX SEVEN EIGHT MILLION TO BE INCOMPLETE CHIEF COMPLIANCE [inaudible] FOR FOR TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO THE I IN IN THE END ON THE USE OF OF EQUIPMENT THAT THE MARKET WILL WILL DRIVE WHAT TYPE OF EQUIPMENT WE TRAIN ON SO THE MARKET WILL WILL DRIVE. QUIT WITH ITS OUT OF USE OUT OF DATE WILL BE TAKEN OF OUR OUT OF OUR APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAMS THERE'S NO USE TO TRAIN APPROACH APPRENTICES ON OLD DIRTY EQUIPMENT -- AND I AND I HAVE THROUGH AN AYE VOTE THING. NEXT WITNESS PLEASE. NOT MISTER CHAIRMAN VERSUS OUR HEELS OVER HALF THE STATE BUILDING CONSTRUCTION TRADES COUNCIL WANT THINK THE SENATOR FOR CARRYING THIS IMPORTANT AND VERY NARROW EXEMPTION FROM IMPORTANT AIR REGULATION OF RULES. AS WAS STATED BY MY COLLEAGUE MISTER CRIMMINS THESE ARE PRIVATELY FUNDED APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAMS THAT ARE FUNDED PRIMARILY BY WORKERS WAGES. WE TRAIN THE BASS SKILLED BUT THEY'RE ALSO VOWED RUN TO STATE OF THE ART AS MUCH AS THEY CAN IT MAKES SENSE THE GRANT IN THE VERY NARROW EXEMPTION AS PROVIDED TO OTHER INDUSTRIES AND OTHER GROUPS IN CALIFORNIA FOR THOSE REASONS WE ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT. EXPERT KNIGHTLEY'S MIKHAIL SCARLET HERE ON OF FROM THE BOOK A GROUPIE ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA COUNCIL FOR ENVIRONMENT COME BALLOTS WERE BUSINESS LABOR ORGANIZATION. A SUPPORTING BOUNCE BETWEEN THE ECONOMY AND THE ENVIRONMENT -- AS MENTIONED BY THE PREVIOUS -- SPEAKERS AT THIS IS A VERY NARROW EXEMPTION OF MUCH NARROWER THAN THE OTHER ONES THAT AIR BECAUSE GRANTED IN REGARDS TO THE LOW USE -- BUSES AND TRUCKS. ACT EQUIPMENT THAT USE LESS THAN WHICH HAS A MUCH LARGER. A FLEA AND THEY CO TRAINING AT THE SAME FACILITIES -- WITH THAT WE APPRECIATE YOUR EITHER. THANK YOU NEITHER WITNESSES IN THE PUBLIC IT WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF THE AUTHORS BILL. PLEASE STATE YOUR NAME AND YOUR REPRESENTING PLEASE MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS THE COMMITTEE ANY BERNACCHI MIGHT HAPPEN NATIONAL ELECTRICAL CONTRACTORS ASSOCIATION CALIFORNIA LEADS THE COMP PLUMBING HEATING PIPING INDUSTRY.

FAMOUS CHAIRMAN KEITH DONE HERE ON BEHALF THE SUFFOLK COUNTIES COALITION THE DISTRICT COUNCIL OF IRON WORKERS THE SENATE CALIFORNIA JUST LIKE TO SAY THAT. THIS TYPE OF PROGRAM IS CRITICAL TO PROVIDE THE WORK FORCE THAT WE NEED TO CONTINUE TO MEET THE DEMANDS OF OUR TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM. HAVING THESE TRAINED AND SKILLED EMPLOYEES TAKES TIME AND RESOURCES. AWAY FROM COST ON THESE PROJECTS IS TO MINIMIZE COST ON WHAT THEY'RE PUTTING OUT THERE AS FAR AS THE OLDER VEHICLES IT'S A GREAT PROGRAM WE ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT OF THIS IMPORTANT DON'T.

NEXT WITNESS PLEASE PHILIP IF ONE TO SOME OF THE ASSOCIATE GENERAL COUNSEL. ASSOCIATE ALL CONTRACTORS A CALIFORNIA TRUSTS WORK THEY CAN. THE MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC THERE ARE TEST FINDS MORE THE AUTHORS BILL. SEEING NONE MEMBERS THE PUBLIC LIKE TO TESTIFY IN OPPOSITION TO THE AUTHORS BILL. PLEASE STATE YOUR NAME IN THE REPRESENTING PLEASE. WELL GOOD EVENING HAVE WILL PARENT WITH THE AMERICAN LUNG ASSOCIATION ON BEHALF OF THE AMERICAN LUNG ASSOCIATION WE HAVE TO RESPECT PROPOSES BILL. CALIFORNIA'S POLLUTION CONTROL PROGRAMS ARE GROUNDED IN THE PROTECTION PUBLIC HEALTH. THIS BILL WOULD EXEMPT OLD LARGE DIESEL ENGINES FROM IT INITIAL CONTROL STANDARDS. THE EXEMPTION PUTS TOXIC CARCINOGENIC POLLUTION IN OUR AIR THREATENS PUBLIC HEALTH MAKES ATTAINMENT OF EMISSION STANDARDS. MORE DIFFICULT AND ULTIMATELY COULD SHIFT EMISSION REDUCTIONS TO OTHER SOURCES. THE WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION HAS DECLARED DIESEL EXHAUST IS CARCINOGENIC CALIFORNIA A STATE RECOGNIZES DIESEL EXHAUST AS A TOXIC AIR CONTAMINANT. ALLOWING THIS EXEMPTION PUTS THE HEALTH OF HEALTH OF WORKERS TRAINEES AND SURROUNDING NEIGHBORS AT RISK. WE DON'T KNOW THE SCOPE OF THE VEHICLE FLEET THE OPERATING LE SITE LOCATIONS OUR NEIGHBORING LAND USES. OR OTHER CRITICAL DETAILS WOULD HELP US TO EVALUATE THIS LEGISLATION. WE'RE CONCERNED THAT THIS EXEMPTION WOULD BREATHE NEW LIFE INTO. EQUIPMENT THAT WOULD EITHER BE OTHERWISE BE RETIRED. BOB WE APPRECIATE THAT THIS COMMITTEE HAS REJECTED PAST EFFORTS TO EXEMPT EQUIPMENT FROM ADMISSIONS REQUIREMENTS IN THE PAST AND REQUESTED OF THE SENATE TODAY THANK YOU. THANK YOU NEXT WITNESS PLEASE AYE MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS BRING INTO IT ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA AIR POLLUTION CONTROL OFFICERS ASSOCIATION. AYE REPRESENTING ALL THE EXECUTIVE OFFICER SMALL THIRTY FIVE LOCAL AIR DISTRICTS OUT WERE ALSO RESPECTFULLY IN OPPOSITION AND CERTAINLY WE APPRECIATE THE VALUE OF THE APPRENTICESHIP. TRAINING PROGRAMS BUT WE ARE VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THE PUBLIC HEALTH IMPACT RELATED THIS ANSWER MISTER BARRETT HAS MENTIONED -- WERE ALSO TALKING ABOUT. THE APPRENTICE APPRENTICES ARE BREATHING -- HIGH CONCENTRATION OF CANCER CAUSING DIESEL PARTICULATE MATTER A AND THAT IS OUR CONCERN IN ADDITION TO THE NEARBY COMMUNITIES -- I WILL POINT OUT THAT THIS REGULATION HAS BEEN ON THE BOOKS SINCE. TWO THOUSAND SEVEN OF V.. AT DEADLINE TO COMPLY AND IS JANUARY -- ONE TWENTY NINETEEN IT'S BEEN POINTED OUT THAT THERE HAVE BEEN OTHER EXEMPTIONS UP LIKE THE JOB CORPS PROGRAM BUT THAT IS DIFFERENT IN THAT IT WENT THROUGH. THE PUBLIC PROCESS THE REGULATORY PROCESS AND THAT'S ONE OF OUR BIG CONCERNS WITH ALL OF THIS IS THAT A A THAT TO US IS IS A WHERE SOMETHING LIKE THIS SHOULD BE RESOLVED IN THERE'S OPPORTUNITY THERE TO DO THAT. AND WE THINK THIS SETS A BAD PRECEDENT WHERE -- IF. OTHERS WILL BE COMING TO THE LEGISLATURE OUGHT TO DO THE SAME THING AND THAT'S ALSO GOING TO HAVE ADDITIONAL PUBLIC HEALTH IMPACT. I WILL. ALSO ADD THAT I'M. THEY'RE THEY'RE OUR INCENTIVE GRANTS AVAILABLE THAT POSSIBLY COULD HAVE BEEN USED FOR THIS AS WELL. TO HELP -- BUT HERE WE ARE AT THE AT THE ELEVENTH HOUR RIGHT BEFORE THE DEADLINE. AND THAT WE RESPECTFULLY. OPPOSE THE MEASURE [inaudible] THANK YOU. ASTEP UP THE MIKE PLEASE STATE YOUR NAME AND WHO YOU REPRESENT PLACE. I THANK YOU A DANTE ACOSTA ASSEMBLY MEMBER THIRTY EIGHTH DISTRICT -- I WAS HERE IN FRONT OF THIS COMMITTEE -- JUST A FEW MONTHS AGO ROB RECENTLY HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO CONSIDER OF THE BILL THAT I AUTHORED AB TWENTY THREE SIXTY FIVE THAT WOULD HAVE INCLUDED THE VERY FOLKS OF THAT THIS BILL SEEKS TO HELP. BUT INSTEAD OF TREATING EVERY A CRANE OPERATOR AND OWNER IN CALIFORNIA THE SAME -- OF THIS BILL -- WAS THAT BILL WAS REJECTED BY THIS BODY AND I THINK THAT -- THIS COMMITTEE SHOULD DEFINITELY REJECT THIS BILL ONE OF THE THINGS THAT -- IS SEWING COMPANY IS AS A LEGISLATURE AND ALL THE U. S. LEGISLATORS IS A FAIRNESS ASPECT TO IT -- IF THE REGULATION IS -- IF THIS REGULATIONS BAD FOR THE OPERATING ENGINEERS AND THEIR PREMISE PRO OF APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAM AND TO BE CLEAR I THINK THAT IT IS -- ONEROUS REGULATION THAT IT'S ALSO BAD FOR THE BUSINESSES THAT HIRE THE VERY PEOPLE THAT THIS APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAM IS TRAINING -- I HAVE A AGAIN OPERATOR MY DISTRICT CHAMPION CRANE WHO HAS UP FOLKS THERE WORKING A THROUGHOUT THE DISTRICTS IN THE VALLEY. ARM THAT ARE HIGHERS THE OPERATING ENGINEERS MEMBERS AND THIS BILL DOES NOTHING FOR THEM AS A MATTER OF FACT THAT BUSINESSES RIGHT ON THE VERGE OF GOING OUT OF GOING OUT OF BUSINESS SO I URGE YOU TO REACT A REJECT THIS HALF MEASURE. AND I REALLY ENCOURAGE THE THE LEGISLATURE TO COME BACK IN THIS COMMITTEE TO COME BACK AND WORK ON MEANINGFUL LEGISLATION THAT BENEFITS ALL CALIFORNIANS AND TREATS THEM EQUALLY. ARE BECAUSE THE VERY ENGINEERS THAT THIS PROGRAM WANTS TO TRAIN WILL COME BACK IN THE CALIFORNIA AND FIND OUT THAT THEY WILL NOT HAVE THE JOBS THAT THESE -- THAT OTHER TRAINING FOR AND I THINK THAT'S REALLY AN ISSUE AND IT'S ALSO AN ISSUE LIKE I SAID EARLIER OF COME OF FAIRNESS. AND I THINK WE NEED TO REJECT HYPOCRISY THAT THIS BILL ACTUALLY JUST THROWS RIGHT UP IN OUR FACE BECAUSE IT'S A IT'S AN ABSOLUTE -- YOU KNOW HYPOCRITICAL MOVED TO SAY THAT THE COMPANY IS SIR IS IS IT'S GOT UP MEET THE SUBJECT IS BUT NOT THE ACTUAL -- ORGANIZATION SO I APPRECIATE THAT YOUR TIME AND I APPRECIATE THE INDULGENCE OF THE CHAIR WHILE THE LONG THANK YOU. NEXT WITNESS PLEASE STATE YOUR NAME AND HE REPRESENT PLEASE. TOM EDISON WITH THE BAY AREA AIR QUALITY MANAGEMENT DISTRICT HEARD AND BEHALF OF IRAQ TO EXECUTIVE OFFICER RESPECTFULLY OPPOSE THE BILL. WE THINK THAT BELONGS OF APPRENTICES IMPORTANT TOO WE THINK THAT APPRENTICES SHOULD BE TRAINING ON NEW CLEAN EQUIPMENT NOT OLD DIRTY EQUIPMENT -- WE WOULD NOTE THAT THIS BILL AS PROPOSED. UNFORTUNATELY DOES NOT GRANT. I TIME EXTENSION OF FOR COMPLIANCE ELIMINATES COMPLIANCE ENTIRELY WE WOULD NOTE THAT THE TWO THOUSAND AND SEVEN REGULATION. SETS UP COMPLIANCE PERIOD THAT STARTS IN TWENTY NINETEEN BUT THAT'S ONLY FOR THE FIRST. OUR INITIAL PORTION OF VEHICLES VEHICLES HAVE UNTIL TWO THOUSAND AND TWENTY EIGHT ARE THERE ARE BEING EXEMPTED FROM THIS RULE TO COMPLY. ARM FOR THOSE REASONS WE'VE BUT TACTFULLY OPPOSE. ISSUE NAMELY REPRESENT PLEASE HER ROCKY RUSHING WITH COLLEGE FOR CLEAN AIR IN APRIL OF THIS YEAR WHEN THIS COMMITTEE REJECTED. ASSEMBLY MEMBER ACOSTA IS BILL HE DID THE RIGHT THING AND IN PART THE ANALYSIS READ BY EXEMPTING ONE CATEGORY OF VEHICLE FROM EXISTING REGULATIONS WE ARE UNDERMINING OUR STATE CALLS AND POTENTIALLY WE OPENING REGULATIONS THAT HAVE BEEN IN PLACE FOR OVER A DECADE. THE ANALYSIS WENT ON TO READ ADDITIONALLY PROVIDING EXEMPTION FOR ONE CATEGORY MAY PRESUMABLY LEAD TO OTHER INDUSTRIES. COMING BACK TO THE LEGISLATURE TO SEEK EXEMPTION. WITH ALL DUE RESPECT TO THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER AND CENTER DELGADO WE THINK THE COMMITTEE GOT IT RIGHT BACK THEN WE HOPE COMMITTEE GETS IT RIGHT TONIGHT THANK YOU SO MUCH THANK YOU. ANY OTHER MEMBERS THE PUBLIC ELECT TESTIFYING OPPOSITION THE AUTHORS BILL. SEEING NONE ANY QUESTIONS OF THE COMMITTEE MISTER FUNG. I WOULD APPRECIATE YOU FOR BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD -- AND CERTAINLY I'M SYMPATHETIC THAT WE NEED WEAPONS OR RELIEF BUT OF COURSE AS AS ASSEMBLY MEMBER -- ACOSTA MENTION I'M AS THESE GRADUATES LEAVE PAPERS ARE PROGRAMS WE CERTAINLY WANT PRINT OPERATORS TO HIRE THEM. SO HOW DO YOU RESPOND TO THAT FACT THAT AND WE ARE PROVIDING AN EXEMPTION FOR THESE -- OPPRESSOR PROGRAMS BUT THEN THE CRANE OPERATORS AT LARGE WHETHER THEY BE UNION OR NOT -- THEY ARE HAVING THESE OWNERS REGULATE TO AND TOUR AND THEY MAKE A LOT OF BUSINESS AND SO THE JOB MARKET ISN'T GONNA BE THERE FOR THEM. IF I MAY I I THINK WE ALL UNDERSTAND THIS IS A A MUCH NARROWER PROPOSITION THAN THE BILL ITSELF REFERENCE IN THE PATH. AND ALMOST A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT POLICY QUESTION. OF BUT I WOULD SAY IN CURRENT PRACTICE NOW WE HAVE SEVERAL CONTRACTORS OR SIGNATORY TO US. WERE WORKING AND THRIVING THAT WE ARE THE BUSINESS WE'VE BEEN AND IT DECADES AND THEY CONTINUE TO THRIVE UNDER THE CURRENT REGULATIONS. HOW MANY GRADUATES WOULD PER YEAR WOULD THAT WEIGH IN ON THAT AND THAT VARIES DRAMATICALLY DEPENDING ON THE ECONOMY -- WE ARE PROBABLY SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA RUNNING. EIGHT HUNDRED NINE HUNDRED GRADUATES AND PLAVI IS SOMEWHAT OF A LIKE NUMBER AND IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA. AND HOW MANY OF THEM GET PLACE AFTER THEY GRADUATE OF THEY ALL DO IT ALL THE BILL WE WERE ACTUALLY LOOKING FOR APPRENTICES NOW WE CAN'T FIND THEM. IN FOR SEVERANCE WE HAVE OPENINGS WERE DYING TO FIND APPRENTICES NOW. BUT BUT I AND IT'S GREAT AND AT WITH THE SENATOR A GREAT THAT THERE IS THAT THE THAT THIS REGULATION IS. FAIRLY ONEROUS ON NOT ONLY DEPEND SHIP TAKE ON THE UNION PROGRAM OTHER PRODUCER PROGRESS BUT ALSO ON THE CRANE OPERATORS AT LARGE IN YOUR DISTRICT. AT THIS POINT I'M SEEKING TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE FOR THE APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAM FOR JOB CREATION THAT'S WHERE IN DIRE NEED IN THE STATE FOR THE BUT ACCEPTING THIS BILL WOULD ALSO ACCEPT THE PREMISE THAT. THAT THIS THAT THIS CAR REGULATION IS ONEROUS WELL ON THE OBOE THEY WE NO REASON FOR THE FOR THE EXEMPTION -- IF I MAY UM AYE AYE WOULD RESPOND -- APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAMS NOTICE OWNERS BUT THE APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAMS ARE REALLY UNIQUE IN THAT THEY HAVE A VERY DIVERSE. FLEET THAT HAVE TO TO MAINTAIN TO TRAIN NOT. A TRADITIONAL CONTRACTOR HAS ABOUT THREE OR FOUR SPECIFIC EQUIPMENT HE CAN RUN THROUGH WE HAVE TO HAVE EVERY PIECE. EQUIPMENT IN THE CATALOG SO WE HAVE A DIVERSIFIED WELL TRAINED WORKFORCE SO TILL IT'S A LITTLE BIT THE RATE OF A AFFECT OUR PROGRAMS IN A DIFFERENT WAY. THAN A TRADITIONAL CONTRACTOR HOUSE UP. I WOULD JUST VENTURE TO SAY THAT THE LEG THAT THIS BILL IT'S A BIT SMALL ITSELF IS CONSISTENT WITH. SIMILAR EXEMPTIONS TO JOB CORPS EXEMPTION ALREADY MAKES THE SAME DETERMINATION THAT THIS IS AN ONEROUS REQUIREMENT FOR CERTAIN PROGRAMS SO. THIS ALREADY IS BEING DONE AND WE ARE JUST SEEKING THIS VERY MINOR. A EXEMPTION FOR THIS PROGRAM WOULD YOU BE OPENED LAST QUESTION OF APOLOGIZED I WOULD VISITORS WOULD YOU BE OPEN TO EXPANDING THE EXEMPTION FOR CRANE OPERATORS -- BROADLY IN THE FUTURE. SO I THINK I THINK WHAT WE'RE LOOKING AT IS AN INCREDIBLY NARROW EXAM FOR THE APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAM WHICH IS NOT GENERATING REVENUE RIGHT. YOU'RE TRAINING PEOPLE IT'S LIKE GOING TO COLLEGE AND YOU'RE NOT GOING TO GIVE THEM A NEW MILLION DOLLAR PIECE OF EQUIPMENT TO TO TRAIN ON UNTIL IT'S YOU KNOW IT THIS IS HAND ME DOWN FROM THE CONTRACTORS THIS IS NOT. BRAND NEW IN FLEET STUFF THAT YOU'RE GONNA BE RUNNING YOU KNOW. THREE SHIFTS A DAY PERK FOR ROAD PROJECT IN AND TO INVEST THAT CAPITAL. IN SOMETHING THAT THAT'S ONLY GONNA GET TWO HUNDRED HOURS OF USE IN A YEAR WOULD BE. IT IT JUST DOESN'T MAKE ANY FINANCIAL SENSE -- AND I THINK THAT'S WHY THE JOB CORPS. WOULD RECEIVE THEIR EXEMPTION IT IT. YOU KNOW TO APPLY THIS TO TO TWO HUNDRED OR LESS IN TWO HUNDRED VEHICLES THAT. ARE USED FOR LESS THAN TWO HUNDRED HOURS IS FAIRLY REASONABLE IN TERMS OF ALSO LIMITED. TO TO TO GO TO OUR THREE LOCATIONS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA SOME OF THESE LOCATIONS ARE CROWE TRAINED WITH JOBS CORPS. AND THEY'RE EXEMPT EQUIPMENT SHIRTS AYE I I I ACCEPT THE PREMISE BEHIND THE THE BILL I JUST WANT TO ENSURE THAT WHEN THESE GRADUATES OF THESE PROGRAMS. GO ENTERED THE WORKFORCE THAT ONE ISSUE THAT THERE ARE MORE CRANE OPERATORS -- AT THAT ARE AVAILABLE AND DRIVING TO HIRE THESE APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAM OR THEIR BODIES GRADUATES AND SO MY HOPE IS THAT IF WE COULD PROVIDE SOME CERTAINTY IN SOME REGULATORY CERTAINTY FOR THESE UP. CRANE OPERATORS IN THE BUSINESS CLIMATE IN CALIFORNIA THAT THEY WERE ABLE. TO HIRE MORE THESE GRADUATES AND SO THAT WE WOULD HAVE MORE GRADUATES WE HAVE MORE EMPLOYEES SO I I APPRECIATE THE TIME THAT IT TOOK BECAUSE OTHER THAN THAT THIS IS A CRITICAL ISSUE AS FAR AS IT RELATES TO JOB CREATION I AM FORTUNATELY M. IN THE LEGISLATOR LEGISLATION ONLY FOR ANOTHER WEEK SO I AM TRYING TO ACHIEVE SOMETHING. OF FOR THE PEOPLE WORKING PEOPLE IN MY COMMUNITY [inaudible] I REQUEST [inaudible] MISTER NAZARIAN. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR GOOD EVENING BY THE WAY [inaudible] AB. IS THERE A MOTION TO MOVE THIS BILL. AND THE SECOND. I JUST WANTED TO MAKE SURE THANK THANK YOU MISTER O'DONNELL CHEN QUIT BUT YOU KNOW THE THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRED SWIMMING QUICK COMMENT I'M HERE FOR JOBS YOU FOR JOB TRAINING YOUR FOR THIS BILL. I APPRECIATE THOSE BILLS BEEN NARROWLY TARIFF TAILORED TO ADDRESS A CERTAIN SITUATION AND THAT IS A JOB TRAINING SITUATION. AND IT COMPLIMENTS OTHER -- LIKE POLICY -- NOW IT MISTER COST YOU BROUGHT OF A BILL THAT YOU HAD NIGHT I MENTIONED AFTER YOU BROUGHT THAT BILL FOR THAT I'D LIKE TO HAVE A CONVERSATION ABOUT THAT BUT THAT. THAT IS A DIFFERENT CONVERSATION THAT WE'RE HAVING TODAY -- AND THAT IS A CONVERSATION INVOLVES MANY STAKEHOLDERS MANY AT THIS TABLE NOW NOT PROMISING ANYTHING OTHER THAN I AM OPEN TO HAVING THAT CONVERSATION. BUT JUST FOR THE SENATOR I DO APPRECIATE THIS NARROWLY TAILORED BILL THAT YOU PRESENTED TODAY THANK YOU. THINK ANY OTHER QUESTIONS THE COMMITTEE MS BAKER. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN AND THANK YOU SENATOR IBM SINCE OUR FIRST HAS ALWAYS MAKES IT. I APPRECIATE THAT I I HAVE CONSIDER I WANNA MAKE SURE THIS APPLIES TO ALL OF MY CONSTITUENTS TO HAVE A COULD APPLY I CARE ABOUT THEIR JOBS IN MY DISTRICT. AND THE WAY THIS IS WRITTEN IT DOESN'T. AND SO I I WELCOME UNDERSTANDING A LITTLE BIT MORE FROM YOU -- WHY NOT INCLUDE MORE BROADLY ALL THE OPERATORS OF THE VERY -- TYPES OF VEHICLES AND IN SPECIFICALLY WHAT IS IT ABOUT A FORKLIFT THAT'S OPERATED BY. YOU KNOW A UNION RELATED A PROGRAM CAN ONE THAT ISN'T BECAUSE THEY THEY ARE THE SAME THE WORKER IN MY DISTRICT IS IS THE SAME THAT BUSINESS IN MY DISTRICT THAT IS WORKING WITH BUT THEM AS WELL AS UNION MEMBERS IS THE SAME. AND THE AIR WE BREATHE AT ALL OF THAT AND SO. WHAT IS DIFFERENT ABOUT THE TYPES OF VEHICLES A VERY SPECIFIC QUESTION THE VEHICLES THAT THIS DOES APPLY? TO AND IF YOU'RE NOT UNION THAT IT DOESN'T. AND I'M INTERESTED IN THE SENATOR'S RESPONSE ACTUALLY SO THIS ACTUALLY SIX AN EXEMPTION FOR STATE REGISTERED NON PROFITS. WHO ARE SEEKING TO CREATE APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAMS SO THERE'S NO SPECIFIC UNION DESIGNATION FOR IT OTHER COULD BE OTHER LIKE A PROGRAMS THAT COULD SEEK THE SAME EXEMPTION? UNDER YOUR ARE YOUR BILL STATE REGISTERED NONPROFIT NONPROFIT APPRENTICESHIP TRAINING PROGRAM SO ARE THERE ARE OPERATORS OF GRADERS LOADERS MOWERS ROLLERS ROUGH TERRAIN FORKLIFTS READ TIRE LOADERS SCRAPERS. SKID STEER LOADERS AND THESE OTHERS THAT ARE NON. THAT ARE ARE NOT COVERED BY THIS THAT ARE IN APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAM THAT WOULD NOT BE COVERED BY THIS BILL OF YOURS JUST MAKING SURE WE UNDERSTAND THE TEXT OF THE BILL. I'M SIZE REPEAT YOUR QUESTION SO. I I I WANNA MAKE SURE I'M UNDERSTANDING YOU CORRECTLY THAT. THEY SOMEONE COULD APPLY FOR THIS. THAT OPERATES ANYONE OF THE VEHICLES TO WHICH THE SUPPLIES THROUGH AND THEY'VE LEARNED THROUGH THE PRESSURE PROGRAM BECAUSE I HAVE THOSE IN MY AREA IN THE BAY AREA AS WELL. YOU MADE IT SOUND LIKE THEY COULD APPLY FOR IT. TOO IF THEY ARE STATE RUN JUST A STATE REGISTER NONPROFIT APPRENTICESHIP TRAINING PROGRAM OKAY SO WHAT APPRENTICESHIP TRAINING PROGRAMS ARE NOT COVERED BY THE BILL. ONES THAT ARE NOT STATE REGISTER NONPROFITS OF WORK DO YOU KNOW WHERE THEY ARE WHERE THEY'RE LOCATED. I'D I DON'T CURRENTLY HAVE A LIST ARE YOU AWARE AYE AYE IF I MAY. UM. SO THE AGAIN THE THESE ARE PROGRAMS REGISTER WITH CALIFORNIA STATE APPRENTICESHIP COUNCIL GENERALLY MOST OF THEM ARE IT CERTAINLY IS THE INDUSTRY'S AT THE DO THE BULK OF THE APPRENTICESHIP TRAINING THE HEAVY EQUIPMENT INDUSTRY. ART JOINT LABOR MANAGEMENT COMMITTEES MEETING THEY HAVE SEVERAL EMPLOYERS AND THAT AND THAT'S WHAT MAKES OUR APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAMS UNIQUE. YOU'RE SERVING SEVERAL EMPLOYERS ENOUGH HAVE SEVERAL PIECES OF EQUIPMENT IS WHAT MAKES IT I THINK WHAT YOU'RE REFERRING TO IF I MAY IS PROBABLY SINGLE EMPLOYER TRAINING PROGRAMS GENERALLY -- I I WOULD ARGUE THAT'S A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT OR SINGLE EMPLOYER WILL MULTI EMPLOYER YOU HAVE TO HAVE A DIVERSITY OF ADVERSE FRIENDSHIP AND A DIVERSE CONTRACTOR BAKER SERVING. AS OPPOSED TO SINGLE EMPLOYERS ONE TYPE OF INDUSTRY GENERALLY LIMITED NUMBER OF EQUIPMENT THEIR TRAINING AT THE END FOR AND FOR THE SENATE AS WELL AS IT IS YOUR BILL YOUR NAME IS ON IT AND YOU ARE DOING IT FOR YOUR CONSTITUENTS I'M ALSO THINKING OF MINE AND OTHER. CALIFORNIANS. WHAT IS DIFFERENT ABOUT THE VEHICLES THAT THEY ARE OPERATING? THE ONES THAT ARE COVERED BY THIS BILL. THAT ARE -- FOR THOSE WHO CAN'T APPLY. WHY SHOULD THEY BE TREATED DIFFERENTLY? WHY SHOULD THIS GROUP RETRAITE TREATED DIFFERENTLY YES? REALLY THE GOVERNMENT VEHICLES LIKE BECAUSE OF MY UNDERSTANDING IS YOU SAY THAT'S A HAND ME DOWN COMING FROM A CONTRACTOR YOU CAN DO THAT AND AND OTHER TRAINING PROGRAMS WHAT'S DIFFERENT ABOUT THAT VEHICLE. THAT IF I IF I MAY SAY SO CARPET DOESN'T ON A FLEET AVERAGE. NOT PER NOT PER VEHICLE ON THE ON THE ENTIRE FLEET A IN YOUR POSSESSION WHETHER. YOU'RE IN YOUR SINGLE EMPLOYER WHETHER YOU'RE AN APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAM. YOUR YOUR CARBS STANDARD IS DETERMINED BY YOUR ENTIRE FLEET AVERAGE IT'S IT'S NOT THE EQUIPMENT OKAY SO. UP THE AIR I STILL TRYING TO UNDERSTAND BECAUSE I'M I'M GONNA BE ABLE TO GO BACK TO MY CONSTITUENTS AND SAY WHY IT'S OKAY TO CARVE SOME OF THEM OUT AND NOT ALLOW OTHERS TO HAVE THE BENEFIT AND WHENEVER I THINK% THEY'VE GIVEN YOU AN ANSWER I THINK GOING. TO GET THE SAME ANSWER. WELL I'M ASKING THAT ANSWER FOR THE QUESTIONS. LET ME WOULDN'T LET ME INTERJECT. SO ACTUAR WAS RIGHT THE MILITA QUESTION THE GO AHEAD MISTER CHAIR YEAH OKAY THANK YOU SO VIVID EXPLAIN TO YOU THAT THESE ARE HAND ME DOWN VEHICLES. OR EQUIPMENT THEY DON'T HAVE THE CAPACITY TO MAKE MONEY OFF THIS LIKE PRIVATE INDUSTRY. SO THEY HAVE TO CONTINUE TO UTILIZE THE EQUIPMENT AND TELL. ITS EXPIRES OKAY. THEY DON'T HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY MAKE A DIME OFF OF THIS. PRIVATE INDEED DOES THEY TRANSFER ANY COST ON TO THE CONSUMER. THEY ARE PRIVATELY FUNDED BY EMPLOYEES [inaudible] DUES SO THIS IS THIS IS THERE FUNDING MECHANISM. THEY WILL THE HUBBY. UTILIZING ANYTHING OTHER THAN THIS EQUIPMENT FOR TRAINING. NOT NOT MAKING MONEY SO THAT'S WHAT THEY'RE DOING. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I I'D YOU HAVING VISIT SOME OF THE LOCATIONS FOR APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAMS IN MY DISTRICT I DO UNDERSTAND THAT COMPONENT BECAUSE I I DO TRY TO GO IN. AND SEE THE STUFF FOR MYSELF AND UNDERSTAND WHAT'S DIFFICULT FOR ME IN A AND I HEARD THE TESTIMONY THAT. WITHOUT THIS WORKERS WILL BE LESS SAFE AND LESS EXPERIENCED AND I'M MORE INTERESTED IN WHEREVER THE WORKER IS WHAT WHATEVER. YOU KNOW EQUIPMENT FLEET THEIR TRAINING ON THAT THEY'RE TREATED EQUALLY. AND THEY HAVE THE SAME EQUAL OPPORTUNITY IN BENEFITS ARE COMING FROM THIS BILL THAT'S THE CONCERN THAT I HAVE ABOUT IT AND AYE I KNOW YOU WORK PART OF THE BACKSTORY ON WHY THERE WAS A BILL EARLIER THIS YEAR AND WHOSE NAME GETS ON AND I ADMIRE THAT YOU. IN THE TIME THAT YOU GET TO SERVE IN THE BODY ARE ABLE TO WANT TO COME FOR IT IT'S JUST THAT IT'S LEAVING OUT SOME OF MY CONSTITUENTS THEY APPRECIATE YOUR CONCERNS. THANK YOU ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OF THE COMMITTEE OF THE AUTHOR. SEEING NONE -- CENTER WE'D LIKE CLOSE. AB MEMBERS THIS BILL SIMPLY PROVIDES AN EXEMPTION -- LIKE PROVIDED FOR THE JOB CORPS APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAM -- FOR THIS A SIMILAR GROUP AND IT WILL HELP CREATE MUCH NEEDED JOBS IN OUR STATE SO I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU SENATOR FOR BRING THIS BILL FORWARD AND AGAIN AS A BY PRODUCT THE APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAM IS A CARPENTER I APPRECIATE.

MISTER CHAIRMAN YOU CAN SAY WHATEVER YOU WANT YOU MEMBERS [inaudible] CHAIR. I'M OFFERING AB THIRTY ONE THIRTY FIVE TO FINAL WHAT FINALLY PART PRIOR TOYS. SUSAN PRIORITIZE SAFETY ON OUR HIGHWAY SYSTEM. THE FACTS ARE CLEAR SINCE TWO THOUSAND TEN THE STATE'S HIGHWAYS HAVE BECOME LESS SAFE. SPECIFICALLY CRASHES HAVE INCREASED 29%.
