HEARING FOR THIS EVENING. OF THIS AFTERNOON FOR UTILITY AND ENERGY WERE FOCUSING ON THE TWENTY TWENTY INVESTOR OWNED UTILITY WHILE FIRE MITIGATION PLANS. AND WE'RE LOOKING FORWARD TO THESE PRESENTATIONS AND SO WHAT I'M GONNA DO IS JUST MAKE A FEW OPENING COMMENTS- THEN WE WERE GOING TO WE'RE GOING TO GET STARTED. WE HAVE A GOOD GREAT PANEL- THAT'S GOING TO BE ASSEMBLED AND I THINK IT'LL BE VERY- INFORMATIVE FOR ALL OF US I'D LIKE TO ALSO THANK THE- MEMBERS AND- THOSE WHO ARE ON THE WHO ARE HERE AND THOSE WHO ARE ON THEIR WAY- THE PUBLIC FOR BEING HERE TODAY. OF THE MOST CRITICAL ISSUES FACING THIS COMMITTEE IS ENSURING THAT WE'VE TAKEN THE STEPS NECESSARY TO REDUCE. RISK AN OCCURRENCE OF CATASTROPHIC WILDFIRES IGNITED BY UTILITY INFRASTRUCTURE. THE FOUNDATION OF THAT WORK IS EMBODIED IN THE I OWE YOU WHILE FIRE MITIGATION PLANS. WHICH ARE THE FOCUS OF TODAY'S HEARING. AND THE LAST TWO LEGISLATIVE SESSIONS LEGISLATURE HAS SIGNIFICANTLY EXPANDED THE IMPORT AND REQUIREMENTS OF THE PLANS IN THE C. B. CEBU CITY HAS CONTINUE TO ENHANCE. AND REFINE PLAN ELEMENTS AND OVERSIGHT. THE TWENTY TWENTY PLANS WERE FILED IN FEBRUARY IN THE C. P. U. C. NEWLY CREATED WHILE FIRE SAFETY DIVISION IS IN THE PROCESS OF REVIEWING THOSE PLANS WITH THE INTENT OF FINALIZING THAT EFFORT BY JUNE. THIS ISN'T A ONE TIME EFFORT. THE PLANS AND RELATED SAFETY WORK BY CAL FIRE- YES AND CEBU CITY AND OTHER STATE AND LOCAL AGENCIES ARE NOW EMBEDDED. AS PRIORITIES IN THE STATE. WE WILL ALSO DISCUSS IN PART TWO OF HERE OF THE HEARING. THE WORK OF THE ARE USED TO REDUCE THE SCOPE DURATION AND FREQUENCY OF PS PS OF THAT'S- UNFORTUNATE. YET NECESSARY TOOL AS WOMEN CLIMATE CHANGE CHANGE CONTINUE TO WREAK HAVOC ON OUR STATE. I DO ASK MEMBERS AND PRESENTERS TO DO THEIR BEST TO KEEP QUESTIONS ABOUT PS PS ADVANCE COMMUNITY OUTREACH EXETER A TWO PART TWO OF THIS HEARING THESE HEARINGS WILL HAVE THE SAME PANEL- BUT WE'RE GOING TO FOCUS ON THE FIRST pWILL BE. ON THE S. P. S. A TODAY WE HAVE THE THREE LARGEST ELECTRICAL CORPORATIONS BEFORE US 2% KEY ELEMENTS. OF THE REP RESPECTED PLANS WE ALSO REALLY WANT TO HEAR. ABOUT BEARS TO FULL EXECUTION OF THE PLANS. WE'VE WE HAVE INVITED A FEW MEMBERS WHO ARE NOT ON THE COMMITTEE TO JOIN US TODAY SOMEONE MEMBERS AGUIAR-CURRY BAUER K. HAND AND WOOD. I'D ALSO LIKE TO SAY BEFORE WE START OF THE OFFICIAL PART OF OUR HEARING- TO ALLOW A GOOD FRIEND OF- THIS ASSEMBLY AND ALSO OUTSTANDING PUBLIC SERVANT IN OUR SUPERINTENDENT OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION- TONY THURMOND- TO SHARE SOME BRIEF COMMENTS AROUND THE P. S. P. S. EVENTS BECAUSE WE KNOW YOU CAN'T STAY THROUGH THE DIRECTION OF THE MEANING. AND TO GIVE US YOUR PERSPECTIVE ON HOW OF THESE OCCURRENCES ARE IMPACTING ON OUR PUBLIC SCHOOLS THROUGHOUT THE STATE SO IF YOU'D LIKE TO JOIN US YOU CAN LEAD US OFF MAYBE ABOUT FIVE MINUTES FOR YOU AND YOUR TEAM TO- MAKES YOUR- AND THEN WE WILL. HOLD ON TO THOSE THOUGHTS AS WE MAKE OUR WAY THROUGH THIS YEAR. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE- TONY THURMOND STATE SUPERINTENDENT OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION. I'M JOINED BY ONE REALIZE WHO HEADS UP OUR FACILITIES DIVISION AND HAS BEEN- OUR LEAD PERSON- WORKING WITH THE OFFICE OF EMERGENCY SERVICES AND OTHERS DURING TIMES OF WHILE FIRING HILL. AT A FEW PERSPECTIVE- APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO JUST SHARE AN APPLE FIVE FEW THE EXPERIENCES OF OUR SCHOOL DISTRICTS IN THE THINGS THAT. THEY EXPERIENCE A DURING WHILE SEASON IN P. S. P. S. EVENTS- DOES IT. WOULD SEEM OBVIOUS TO YOU THAT SCHOOLS ARE IMPACTED JUST LIKE EVERY OTHER ASPECT OF OUR COMMUNITY. AND TAKE IT REALLY HARD WHEN THERE IS LOSS OF LIFE- LOSS OF POWER A LOSS OF OPPORTUNITY TO ENSURE THAT OUR STUDENTS ARE GETTING A GREAT EDUCATIONAL EXPERIENCE. I LIKE TO SAY AT THE OUTSET THAT WE'RE GRATEFUL- TO MANY OF THE I. O. U.'S HAVE BEEN IN COMMUNICATION WITH US DIRECTLY- AND SCHOOLS AND ACCEPTED OUR INVITATION. TO TALK ABOUT THE EXPERIENCE OF OUR SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND HOW WE KEEP THAT- AT THE FOREFRONT OF THEIR MIND- SEE- WORK WITH THIS COMMITTEE AND LEGISLATORS ON PLANS- TO- MANAGE FUTURE. NEEDS YOUR AGENDA IS FULL- AND WE NOW THAT THERE ARE MANY ITEMS THAT HAVE TO BE COVERED BUT WE APPRECIATE. THAT SCHOOLS- CONTINUE TO BE IN THAT CONVERSATION. AS YOU CAN IMAGINE OUR SCHOOL DISTRICTS. STRUGGLE FROM THE RANGE OF THINGS THAT COME UP ONE IT'S JUST KNOWING WHAT TO EXPECT ABOUT WHAT PARTS OF COMMUNITIES MIGHT BE- WITHOUT POWER- IN THE BILL WE NEED TO HAVE. A CLEAR INFORMATION AND MAPS AND TIMELY INFORMATION ABOUT WHERE POWER SAFETY SET OFF WILL OCCUR. IS ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE'VE HEARD- I WOULD SAY THE LOUDEST FROM OUR SCHOOL DISTRICTS THEY LIKE TO HAVE MORE OF THAT. WHEN IT COMES TO THE ACTUAL PS PS ADVANCE SCHOOLS HAVE BEEN REALLY CLEAR. HAVE GENERATORS IN MANY DON'T AND SO IT BECOMES A CHALLENGE TO PROVIDE EDUCATION WITHOUT ANY POWER- SO FOR SCHOOL DISTRICTS THAT ARE ARE FEEL THAT THEY CAN SAFELY REMAIN OPEN. DURING THE YES BE YES THEY THE SCHOOLS WILL SAY US THAT TIME WHAT THE- HAS BEEN CLASSROOMS ARE WITH THE- HEAT NOT ALWAYS THE BEST LIGHTING- DIDN'T INABILITY TO KEEP FOOD- PRESERVE FOR. STUDENTS MEALS- AND SO AS YOU CAN IMAGINE THEY'RE ALL KINDS OF CHALLENGES- THAT DISTRICTS FACE. DURING THESE TIMES- OF CHALLENGE IN SO THAT WE WOULD ASK THAT YOUCONTINUE AS YOU MAKE THESE PLANS. TO CONSIDER NEEDS A SCHOOL AND THEN ALSO ULTIMATELY THE QUESTION THAT WE HEAR FROM DISTRICTS IS HOW DO WE ADDRESS THE LOSS OF INSTRUCTION TIME. AND SO WHILE THAT MAY NOT BE- AT THE TOP OF THE LIST FOR THIS COMMITTEE WE HOPE THAT YOU WILL CONSIDER ALL THESE ITEMS IN THE IMPACT IT HAS. ON OUR ABILITY TO SUPPORT OUR SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND TO SUPPORT OUR SIX MILLION STUDENTS IN THE STATE- LIKE TO. GIVE MISTER ROSS IS AN OPPORTUNITY GIVE ME JUST ANOTHER MINUTE OR TWO OF EMPHASIS ON SOME OF THE THINGS THAT WE HAVE HEARD FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF OUR SCHOOLS THANK YOU. AFTER MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS OVERALL LAST YEAR WE HAD OVER FIFTEEN HUNDRED SCHOOLS CLOSED NUMBER IMPACTING OVER A HUNDRED THOUSAND STUDENTS. AND WHAT IT IS UNDER YOUR SHIP OUR STATE SUPERINTENDENT HELD A CONFERENCE CALL WITH TWENTY THREE COUNTY SUPERINTENDENTS. HERE FROM THEN WHAT IS THE STATUS OF SCHOOLS TO HEAR WHAT THE CHALLENGES ARE. AND THE NUMBER ONE ISSUE ON THAT WE HEARD FROM THE SCHOOLS THAT DID REMAIN OPEN WHAT'S HAVE AXES- GENERATORS- MAYBE SCHOOL NOT JUST LIKE THE STATE SUPERINTENDENT GEN AND THIS IMPACTS EMMONS. AWAY I'M IS REFER PATIENTS FOR FOOD BUT THE STATE'S WHICH ANIME. BUT ALSO MANAGE. FOR STUDENTS TO HAVE SPECIAL NEEDS FOR MEDICATION. SOME SCHOOLS SPECIAL RULES SCHOOLS RUN ON WELL SYSTEMS. THEY NEED ELECTRIC PUMPS TO HAVE FLOWING WATER MANY OF THEM DID NOT. AND AS ANOTHER FACTOR THAT THEY HAD TO CONSIDER WHEN CLOSING SCHOOLS. AND SOMETIMES THESE ISSUES WENT BEYOND THE SCHOOL CAMPUSES THEMSELVES- TRANSPORTATION OF THERE'S NO FUEL IF THE GAS- GET THERE'S GUYS THERE'S NO GASOLINE FOR THAT BUSES THEY CAN TRANSPORT STUDENTS. AND EVEN SOME TRAFFIC LIGHTS YOU KNOW BEYOND THE SCHOOLS IF THERE'S NO TRAFFIC IT BECAME A VERY FOR SCHOOLS FOR STUDENTS TO WALK TO SCHOOL SAFELY- OVERALL IT THE STATE'S A PLAN MENTION. HAVING AXIS TWO GENERATORS WAS A BIG FACTOR IN REMAINING OPEN. AND WE DID HEAR FROM SOME OF OUR COUNTY SUPERINTENDENTS THAT THEY DID NOT RECEIVE. A TIMELY AND ACCURATE INFORMATION WHICH IS CRITICAL FOR THEM TO PLAN ACCORDINGLY WHEN MAKING DETERMINATIONS TO CLOSE SCHOOLS. AND TO COMMUNICATE WITH THE PARENTS AND THE COMMUNITY. AND WITH THAT I'D LIKE TO. ASK ME QUESTIONS. IT WAS WE SUBMITTED A QUESTION FROM YOUR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE WELL THANK YOU- I THINK PROBABLY THE BEST WAY TO PROCEED IS THAT. YOU RAISE A VERY IMPORTANT ISSUE AND WITH YOUR JURISDICTION AND ALL OF OUR CONCERN WE NEED TO. MAKE SURE THEY WERE PAYING ATTENTION TO HOW THESE ISSUES IMPACT ON ON SCHOOLS AS WELL AS- HOSPITALS AND OTHER FACILITIES AROUND COMMUNITIES THAT ARE. ARE VERY IMPORTANT- TO MAKE SURE POWER IS SOMEWHERE IS MAKING ITS WAY TO THAT LOCATION WHAT I WOULD. SUGGEST BECAUSE I THINK THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT TO SHARE TODAY AND WE WILL HOPE. PASS ALONG YOUR THOUGHTS I KNOW THAT THE REPRESENTATIVES OF THE UTILITIES WHO ARE HERE TODAY. ARE TAKING NOTE- BUT THE CPSC IS REVIEWING THESE WELL FOR MANY YEARS AND PLANS AND IT THERE'S A PROCESS THAT YOU CAN A SUPERINTENDENT ON BEHALF OF THE SCHOOLS IN THIS DISTRICT KIND OF OUTLINE- SPECIFIC ISSUES AS YOU'VE DONE HERE TODAY. THAT WOULD PROBABLY BE VERY INSTRUCTIVE TO THE AGENCY AS IT GOES THROUGH ITS PROCESS AND HAS ITS COMMENTS BACK TO THE UTILITY SO. I WOULD JUST MAKE THAT SUGGESTION AS A WAY TO FURTHER. YOUR COMMUNICATION AND GETTING INFORMATION OUT ALL PAUSE IF THERE'S ANY OTHER MEMBER THAT WOULD LIKE TO ASK A QUESTION BUT- WE'RE GIVING YOU THE COURTESY BECAUSE- YOU DESERVE THE COURTESY IN YOUR WELL AS A FORMER MEMBER YOU ALWAYS HAVE PRIVILEGES AROUND HERE- BUT WE WILL STAY IN CONTACT WITH YOU AND- CERTAINLY BE HELPFUL ALONG THE WAY TO. TO MAKE SURE THAT THE VOICE OF THE CHILDREN IN THE SCHOOLS IN THIS DISTRICT HEARD. THINGS CHAIR AND- WE WILL ACT ON YOUR SUGGESTION I WOULD SAY THAT THE STAFF OF THIS COMMITTEE HAS BEEN PARTICULARLY HELPFUL IF WE COULD WORK WITH THEM ON HOW TO MAKE THAT HAPPEN OR YOU KNOW WE HAVE ACCESS TO THE YOU KNOW THE FIFTY EIGHT COUNTY SUPERINTENDENTS AND THEIR DISTRICTS. AND THEN THEIR ASSOCIATIONS THAT REPRESENT THE MORE THAN A THOUSAND SCHOOL DISTRICTS SO WE'RE FAIRLY CONFIDENT THAT IT WOULD BE EASY FOR US TO GET FEEDBACK AND ENGAGE FOLKS BUT WE CAN WORK WITH YOUR STAFF ON HOW TO MAKE THE CONNECTION DIRECTLY. WITH THE RIGHT FOLKS TO THE CPUC WOULD BE HAPPY TO MAKE SURE THAT PERSPECTIVE IS INCLUDED DONE DEAL. THANK YOU. THANK YOU I'M SORRY. PRESS I JUST WANT TO THANK YOU SO MUCH OF SUPERINTENDENT FOR PROVIDING THIS INFORMATION BUT I WOULD HOPE THAT DURING THE SECOND SESSION THE HAVING HEARD THE CONCERNS OF REGARDING OUR SCHOOLS THAT THE FOOD THE PRESENTERS A PANELIST WILL ADDRESS THIS. THANK YOU THAT'S REQUEST. THANKS SO MUCH THANK YOU. SO LET'S MOVE TO OUR FIRST PANEL AND THAT PESENTATION IS ON THE WELFARE MITIGTION PLANS AND I'LL CALL FOR THE PANELISTS A JOHN JENKINS WHO IS THE VICE PRESIDENT. ELECTRIC SYSTEMS OPERATION FOR SAN DIEGO GAS AND ELECTRIC BILL HARRINGTON SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT OF TRANSITION TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA EDISON. DEBRA POWELL VICE PRESIDENT ASSET RISK MANAGEMENT AND COMMUNITY WHAT WILD FIRE SAFETY PROGRAM. FOR PACIFIC GAS AND ELECTRIC AND MATTHEW PENDER DIRECTOR COMMUNITY WHILE FIRE SAFETY PROGRAM THE CIVIC GAS AND ELECTRIC. WILL WE WELCOME ALL OF YOU AND IF YOU CAN MAKE YOUR PRESENTATION IN THE ORDER OF WHICH YOU WERE CALLED UP. THERE WILL BEGIN. ALL RIGHT- I'LL BE READY. WE ARE READY OKAY GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS JOHN JENKINS I'M SAN DIEGO GAS ELECTRIC SPICE PRESIDENT OF ELECTRICITY TO OPERATIONS AND I APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY MISTER CHAIR. IS A BETTER OKAY APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO COME HERE AND PRESENT TO THE OTHER MEMBERS TODAY AN OVERVIEW OF SD GINNY'S WILDFIRE MEDICATION PLAN. OF YOU GO TO THE FIRST SLIDE IN THE DECK- THIS IS JUST TO HELP PROVIDE SOME CONTEXT ABOUT OUR SERVICE TERRITORY- SO. OUTLINED IN THE IN THE BRIGHT RED LINE IS AS DISNEY'S FORTY ONE HUNDRED SQUARE MILES OF SERVICE TERRITORY THAT COVERS SAN DIEGO COUNTY IN THE SOUTHERN PART OF ORANGE COUNTY- WITHIN THAT READ. BOLDED LINE- YOU SEE THE YELLOW SHADED AREA THAT'S OUR HIGH FIRE THREAT DISTRICT HERE TOO. AND THEN WITHIN THAT THE- PINK SHADED AREA IS OUR HIGH FIRED THREAT DISTRICT HERE THREE- AND THIS COMPRISES 64% OF THOSE FORTY ONE HUNDRED SQUARE MILES THAT I MENTIONED WE ALSO HAVE A SIXTY FIVE HUNDRED OVERHEAD ABOVE CIRCUIT MILES. THIRTY FIVE HUNDRED OF THOSE MILES ARE IN THE HYPER THREAT DISTRICT- WE HAVE ONE POINT OVER ONE POINT THREE MILLION ELECTRIC METERS THAT WE SERVE A TUNER SIX THOUSAND THOSE- RESIDE IN THE HIGHER THREAT DISTRICT. WE HAVE ONE HUNDRED NINETY ONE WEATHER STATIONS THAT GIVE US REAL TIME WEATHER INFORMATION AND- SMALLER MICROCLIMATE AREAS TO HELP US MAKE- OPERATIONAL DECISIONS AND GIVE US INFORMATION TO AND FORMER MITIGATION EFFORTS. AND ANOTHER UNIQUE ASPECT OF OUR SERVICE TERRITORY AS WE DO HAVE 61% OF OUR INFRASTRUCTURE IS UNDERGROUND- HOWEVER THE MAJORITY THAT IS COASTAL- SO MORE OUTSIDE OF THE HYPER THREAT DISTRICT. AND WE HAVE FOUR HUNDRED SIXTY THOUSAND TREES THAT WE INVENTORY IN OUR DATABASE AND 53% OF THOSE VEGETATION ASSETS FROM THE HYPER THREAT DISTRICT. NEXT SLIDE OF ONE MORE SLIDE ON TO PROVIDE SOME CONTEXT AS TO THE CHANGING CONDITIONS- THIS IS A TOOL THAT THAT WE DEVELOPED A NUMBER OF YEARS AGO CALLED THE SANTA ANA WILDFIRE THREAD INDEX IN THE STATES- THIS- TRACKS. THE INDEX BACK TO NINETEEN EIGHTY FOUR- AND YOU CAN SEE THE RISE AND OCCURRENCES AND FREQUENCY OF OCCURRENCES. OF EXTREME WEATHER CONDITIONS AND TO AS NOTED ON THE SLIDE FIFTEEN OF THE TWENTY. FIVE MOST DESTRUCTIVE FIRES IN THE STATE'S HISTORY OF OCCURRED SINCE TWO THOUSAND. NOW MOVING ON TO- THE- IGNITION CAUSES- I WOULD LIKE TO CLARIFY THAT THIS INFORMATION IS SYSTEM WIDE SO OBVIOUSLY THE MAJORITY OF OUR MITIGATION EFFORTS- AND PROCEDURES THAT WE HAVE DURING ELEVATED CONDITIONS OCCUR IN THE HYPER THREAT DISTRICT BUT THIS- THIS TABLE IS SYSTEM WIDE- AND- GOES THROUGH THE VARIOUS CONTACT- CAUSES. OF OUR IGNITIONS IN OUR SERVICE TERRITORY- AND YOU CAN SEE THE TOTALS OF THE BOTTOM GOING FROM THIRTY IN 200-015-2215 IN TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN- THE PART OF THE PIE CHART ON THE RIGHT. GOES OVER- THE CAUSES FOR THE LAST FIVE YEARS AND PERCENTAGES SO WE HAVE 35% THAT ARE BECAUSE FROM FROM EQUIPMENT ISSUES. AND IT'S 65% OF SOME SORT OF CONTACT WITH WITH OUR LINES FROM FOR LARGER OBJECTS SUCH AS A- MYLAR BALLOONS. NOW MOVING ON TO THE- ACTIVITIES THAT ARE IN OUR TWENTY TWENTY WILD FIRE MITIGATION PLAN- THERE ARE SIXTY FIVE ACTIVITIES THAT ARE IN THE PLAN THESE ARE A- HIGHLIGHTS OF SOME OF THE MAIN ACTIVITIES THAT THAT ARE OCCURRING- THE FIRST TWO. OF WE'LL START WITH THE FIRST ONE SAYS HARDENING OF AS PART OF THE EVOLUTION OF OUR MITIGATION EFFORTS WE ARE INCORPORATING MORE UNDERGROUND IN THIS PLAN. OF THE REASON FOR THAT BEING IS WE HAVE CERTAIN PARTS OF OUR TERRITORY THAT HAVE. THE TERRAIN AND FUELS AND WHEN CONDITIONS WORSE- CONSISTENTLY SEE ONE SPEEDS OVER SIXTY MILES AN HOUR WORDS JUST HARD FOR US TO GET COMFORTABLE WITH HAVING OVERHEAD. ENERGIZED FACILITIES THERE EVEN IF IT'S COVERED CONDUCTOR WITH. REPLACING HIGH RISK EQUIPMENT WITH VEGETATION MANAGEMENT ON ALL THOSE THINGS ARE STILL AN INHERENT RISK HAVING ENERGIZED FACILITIES OVERHEAD IN. IN THOSE REALLY RISKY AREAS. ANOTHER PART OF OUR UNDERGROUND IN IS WHAT WE CALL DIRECT UNDER GROUNDING AND WHAT THIS IS EXPRESS UNDERGROUND CIRCUITS OUT TO SOME OF THESE BACK COUNTRY COMMUNITY CENTERS. SO WE WOULD UNDERGROUND JUST THOSE COMMUNITIES. AND UNDER FEEDER THOSE SO WE COULD KEEP. CRITICAL FACILITIES ON TO SCHOOLS- AS JUST MENTION THE OPENING REMARKS OF STORES- URGENT CARE CENTERS- COMMUNITY CENTERS WHERE PEOPLE CAN GO DURING DURING THESE EVENTS AND- SO THAT'S INCORPORATED IN OUR UNDERGROUND AS WELL IN THE CANTEEN WITH THEIR OVERHEAD. HARDENING EFFORTS WITH THAT WITH A HUNDRED FORTY FIVE MILES OF OVERHEAD HARDENING INCLUDING BEAR AND COVER CONDUCTOR. OVER THE THREE YEAR PERIOD- WE'RE GOING TO BE INSTALLING A THIRTY ADDITIONAL WEATHER STATIONS TO. PROVIDE MORE INFORMATION FOR US TO BE EVEN MORE PRECISE THEM ARE ARE AND IN. THAT INSTEAD OF US HAS FIVE CUSTOMERS. ONCE EACH THE PROP CONDITION WERE THE ROOT IS HI THE END. THAT MAYBE CALL DOWN TO THREE HUNDRED SO AN EXAM OF USING. H. INCOME WITH THE LIES BASIS. WE ARE ALL WHY WE HAVE OVER ONE THIRD OF MOUNTAIN TOP I'M A RENT DEFINITION CAN WERE GOING TO BE IMPROVING THE TECH AND THE TO COMMUNICATE TO THOSE AND THIS THERE VALUABLE TOOL FOR A WANNA MAKE SURE THAT THEY THE TO STAY CLEAN WITH AND THE BUT THE LATEST TECHNOLOGY POSSIBLE. AND THEN MOVING ON TO ENHANCE VEGETATION. THAT WE DEVELOP THE VEGETATION RISK INDEX IN TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN- THROUGH THE DATA ANALYSIS OF THE DATA AND OUR DATABASE WE'VE IDENTIFIED FIVE SPECIES OF TREES THAT ARE MORE PROBLEMATIC THAN OTHERS- PINE PALM OAK EUCALYPTUS AND SICK MARKED A TO BE PRECISE- AND WE'RE LOOKING TO GO. BEYOND OUR TWELVE TO FIFTEEN FEET OF HOSE TRIM CLARENCE THAT WE CURRENTLY GET- TO UP TO TWENTY FIVE FEET DEPENDING ON THE SITUATION AND SO WE'RE TRYING TO- DO THAT TO FIFTY ONE THOUSAND OF OUR FOUR HUNDRED AND FIFTY FIVE THOUSAND TREES- IN THIS TIME PERIOD- THAT'S IN THIS TIME PERIOD. I WERE ALSO DOING SOME FUELS MANAGEMENT- WHERE WE HAD WE STARTED A PILOT PROGRAM LAST YEAR WHERE WE- AGAIN IN THE REALLY RISKY AREAS WE HAVE SOME FUEL BEDS THAT WE WANTED TO CLEAR TO REDUCE THE POSSIBLE SOURCE CAN IGNITION. US WITH THAT FOR TWENTY FIVE MILES IN TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN SO WE'RE GONNA CONTINUE THAT PROGRAM OVER THE- THE THREE YEAR PERIOD HERE- ADVANCED PROTECTION. OF FIFTY FIVE. SUBSTATIONS A IN OUR HIGH FIRE THREAT DISTRICT. OF THIS TWENTY WILL HAVE ALMOST EVERY SUBSTATION WOULD HAVE ADVANCED PROTECTION CAPABILITIES NOW AND WHAT THAT MEANS. AS WE HAVE COMMUNICATION TO THOSE SUBSTATIONS AND COMMUNICATION FROM THE SUBSTATIONS OUT TO THE PROTECTIVE DEVICES ON THE LINES. IT HELPS TO ENABLE OUR SINCE THE PROFILE PROTECTION WHICH- THE QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE- IDENTIFIES FAULTS AND ISOLATES THEM LIMITING THE AMOUNT OF ENERGY AVAILABLE OBVIOUSLY LIMITING THE- A POSSIBLE SOURCE OF IGNITION. IT ALSO ENABLES ARE FALLING CONDUCTOR PROTECTION SO IF SOMETHING COMES IN CONTACT WITH OUR LINES. BRINGS THE LINE DOWN IT WILL BE ENERGIZED THE LINE BEFORE IT HITS THE GROUND OBVIOUSLY- MITIGATING THE POSSIBILITY ENDING MISSION THAT SITUATION I TALKED ABOUT THE S. ACTUALIZING DEVICES IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE WEATHER STATIONS- THERE'S DEFINITELY. DEFINITELY PS PS BENEFITS TO THAT- WE'LL TALK ABOUT THAT IN THE SECOND PRESENTATION. OF MICRO BRAIDS- SIMILAR TO MY DIRECT AROUND HIM OR WE'RE GONNA UNDERGROUND SOME COMMUNITY CENTERS TO PROVIDE SOME CRITICAL GOODS AND SERVICES TO THE BACK COUNTRY COMMUNITIES- SOMETIMES IT'S MORE COST EFFECTIVE TO DO THOSE THROUGH MY CORPORATE SO WE'LL DO IT OF. A DEPLOYED DISTRIBUTED ENERGY RESOURCE SUCH AS GENERATION OR ENERGY STORAGE- TO BE THE SOURCE- FOR THOSE COMMUNITY CENTERS AND SO THERE ARE. SEVEN MICROPHONES PLAN OVER THE YEAR PERIOD FOR THOSE WILL BE INSTALLED AND IN TWO THOUSAND TWENTY AND THEN A COUPLE OF OTHER- GENERATOR PROGRAMS WE HAVE A- MEDICAL BASS LINE GENERATOR PROGRAM THAT WE STARTED IN TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN WILL BE OFFERED A- BATTERY STORAGE UNIT IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE PORTABLE SOLAR PANELS SO THEY COULD RECHARGE DURING THE DAY- TO PROVIDE EMERGENCY SOURCE. OF FOR PEOPLE WITH NEBULIZERS AUCTION TANKS AND THINGS LIKE THAT. WE'RE GONNA EXPAND THAT PROGRAM OF IN THIS THREE YEAR PERIOD. AND IN LOOKING AT SOME BEHIND THE METER SOLUTIONS TO SOAR GONNA PILOT- SOME DIFFERENT- TYPES OF GENERATION SO WE'RE GONNA LOOK AT. ENERGY STORED ROOFTOP SOLAR CONJUNCTION WITH ENERGY STORAGE- EVEN POSTLE FUEL GENERATION- THERE CERTAIN SITUATIONS THAT WE HAVE FIVE MILES A BLIND FEE. FIVE TO TEN CUSTOMERS IT JUST ISN'T ECONOMICALLY VIABLE TO HARDEN THAT LINE FOR THAT NUMBER CUSTOMERS. SO TO HELP MITIGATE THE EFFECTS OF PS PS WILL BE LOOKING AT BEHIND THE METER SOLUTIONS TO PROVIDE THEM POWER DURING THOSE SITUATIONS. AND THEN THE LAST SLIDE IS JUST THE FINANCIALS THAT ARE- GO ALONG WITH THE ACTIVITIES THAT I JUST DESCRIBED AND WE HAVE THE TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN ACTUAL AS WHICH WE- A SPENT IN THOSE CATEGORIES- COMPARED TO. WHAT'S PLANNED FOR TWO THOUSAND TWENTY AND THEN WHAT'S INCORPORATED IN THE- THREE YEAR TWO THOUSAND TWENTY THROUGH TWO THOUSAND TWENTY TWO PLAN- WHICH IS A TOTAL OF APPROXIMATELY NINE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS. CAPITAL OVER THE THREE YEARS FOR SAN DIEGO GAS ELECTRIC. I WE HOLDING THE QUESTIONS TILL THE END OR WE CAN. OKAY ONCE ALL OF YOUR CREDIT. OKAY GOOD AFTERNOON SURE HOLD AND- MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE ASSEMBLY MEMBERS IN ATTENDANCE I'M FILL HARRINGTON THE SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT OF TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION FOR SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA EDISON UP WE WANT TO THANK YOU FOR HOLDING THIS HEARING TODAY ALLOWING US TO YOU THE OPPORTUNITY TO SHARE THE SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS WE'VE MAKING- IN WALL FIRE MITIGATION AS WELL AS LESSONS LEARNED FROM THE OCTOBER TWENTY NINETEEN P. S. P. S. OFFENSE. WE PROVIDE YOU WITH A PRESENTATION- I WILL OCCASIONALLY REFERRED TO THIS ROUTE OBVIOUSLY WE CAN ANSWER QUESTIONS. ABOUT THE PRESENTATION LATER BUT I WILL NOT BE GOING TO SLIDE BY SLIDE THROUGH THIS A RIGHT NOW. S. C. E. HAS SAFETY IS OUR NUMBER ONE PRIORITY AND WE ARE COMMITTED TO CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT. TOP IN THAT SPIRIT- WHILE WE'RE HERE TO- SURE PLAN A PROGRAMS WITH YOU- MOST IMPORTANT WE'RE HERE TO LISTEN- WE NOT ONLY OF THE YOUR FEEDBACK WE NEED YOUR FEEDBACK AND SO- WE WANNA CORPORATE THAT OUR PLANS GOING FORWARD. RIGHT BEFORE- THE INCREASING WILDFIRE RISK WAS A PARENT- WE ARE INVESTING IN A SMARTER MORE RESILIENT TO READ. OVER THIS PAST DECADE WE'VE INVESTED MORE THAN ELEVEN BILLION DOLLAR TO. MAINTAIN UPGRADE AND MODERNIZE. OUR GRADE WITH STATE OF THE ART TECHNOLOGY. THAT IMPROVES RELIABILITY AND WILDFIRE RESILIENCY. NOW THIS HAS THE ADDED BENEFIT OF MAKING OUR SYSTEM- BETTER PERFORMING IN PS PS VETS. REDUCING THE SCOPE AND THE SCALE THOSE OCCURRENCES. NOW THIS HISTORY OF INVESTMENT ALLOWS US TO SECTIONAL AS OUR SYSTEM- WHICH IS WE'VE TALKED ABOUT PREVIOUSLY HAS BENEFITS IN THE P. S. P. S. EVENTS. AS AN EXAMPLE- DURING THE EVENTS OF LAST YEAR THE SIGNIFICANT EVENTS OUT OF THE FIVE MILLION CUSTOMERS OR METERED CUSTOMERS IN OUR SERVICE TERRITORY. AROUND A HUNDRED THOUSAND OR 2% WERE ULTIMATELY DE ENERGIZED- SO THAT'S EVEN THOUGH WE HAVE ROUGHLY FOURTEEN THOUSAND SQUARE MILES OF HIGH FIRE RISK AREA WHICH ACCOUNTS FOR ROUGHLY A THIRD OF OUR SERVICE AREA. OUR EFFECTIVELY WORKING WITH CUSTOMERS AND COMMUNITIES TO DETERMINE HOW WE CAN MINIMIZE THE IMPACTS OF PS PS. AND THROUGH GREAT HARDENING AS WELL AS OPERATIONAL CHANGES. REDUCE THE IMPACT OF P. S. P. S. OVER TIME. NOT HOWEVER OUT YOUR OLD YOU MENTION THIS UNFORTUNATELY PSP AS WILL STILL NEED TO REMAIN AVAILABLE TO US. AS A TOOL DURING EXTREME EVENTS. NOW WE PROPOSED TO IN OUR TWENTY TWENTY WHILE FIRE MITIGATION PLAN- THAT WILL MOVE US WELL BEYOND COMPLIANCE WITH REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS- AND REALLY INSTEAD TOWARD DAY IMPLEMENTING PRACTICES. PROCEDURES OR POSITION US AS THE INDUSTRY LEADER IN WALL FIRE MITIGATION. NOW TODAY I'LL DISCUSS FOR TWENTY NINETEEN WORK- AS WELL AS OUR TWENTY TWENTY PLAN. AND ALSO SURE WERE ADAPTING APPROACH TO PSP A SPACE ON COMMUNITY AND CUSTOMER FEEDBACK. SO AFTER THE DEVASTATING FIRES OF TWENTY SEVENTEEN- AS HE PUT FORTH THE GRID SAFETY RESULT RESILIENCY PROGRAM- THIS WAS WELL BEFORE THE- SI PC WHILE FIRE MITIGATION PLAN PROCEEDINGS WE KNOW TODAY. WE KNEW WE NEEDED ACT AND WE WANTED TO DO THAT EXPEDITIOUSLY AND THOUGHTFULLY AND THAT WAS REFLECTED IN THAT PROGRAM. NOW SINCE TWENTY EIGHTEEN- WE'VE INSTALLED ROUGHLY FIVE HUNDRED MILES OF COVER CONDUCTOR- AS A MEASURE OF HARDING OUR INFRASTRUCTURE. OVER FOUR HUNDRED EIGHTY WEATHER STATIONS HAVE BEEN INSTALLED OVER THAT TIME PERIOD. AND HUNDRED SIXTY HIGH DEFINITION CAMERAS COVERING 90% OF OUR HIGH FIRE RISK AREAS. NOW WE'RE ABLE TO GO WELL BEYOND THE COMPLIANCE TARGET SO WE SET FORTH IN OUR TWENTY NINETEEN WHILE FIRE MITIGATION PLAN. AND YOU CAN SEE A LIST OF THE PROGRESS WE'VE INCLUDED THAT ON SLIDE FOR. NOW WE HAVE BEEN LASER FOCUS ON DOING THE WORK- THAT- ARE REGULATORS. AND THIS LEGISLATOR HAS SET BEFORE US. NOW BEYOND THAT AND AT THE SAME TIME WE FOUND WAYS TO MORE. THE S. SEES MOVING SWIFTLY AND DELIBERATELY TO REDUCE RISK BEFORE THIS NEXT THE BARS SEASON WHICH IS NEAR UPON US. NO THAT'S WHAT WE DID IN TWENTY NINETEEN SELECT A SURE WITHIN OUR PLANS FOR TWENTY TWENTY. IN OUR TWENTY TWENTY WHILE FOR A MITIGATION PLAN FILING WE PROPOSE INVESTING THREE POINT EIGHT BILLION DOLLARS THE PAST ME. OVER THE NEXT THREE YEARS TO REDUCE THE CHANCE THAT OUR LOCAL SERVICE EQUIPMENT SPARKS OF FIRE. THERE ARE TWENTY NINETEEN IN OUR TWENTY TWENTY PLAN EXCUSE ME WE PROPOSE INVESTING THREE POINT EIGHT BILLION DOLLARS OVER THE NEXT THREE YEARS TO REDUCE THE CHANCE THAT OUR ELECTRICAL EQUIPMENT SPARKS OF FIRE. AND TO MITIGATE THE IMPACT OF POWER SHUT OFFS. I'LL BE HIGHLY DETAILS OF THAT PLAN TO DEMONSTRATE OUR BUILDING ON PREVIOUS WORK AS WELL AS SIGNIFICANTLY STEPPING UP OUR DEPLOYMENT. ACROSS OUR TIRE PLATFORM INCLUDING INNOVATION. THE ONLY SPEND A MOMENT ON OUR CORE FOCUS AREAS THIS WILL NOT BE THE ENTIRE PLAN I GO THROUGH THERE'S A NUMBER OF A- NUMBER PROGRAMS IN THERE THAT ARE WORTH SPENDING TIME ON- BUT THIS IS COVERED SLICE FIVE THREE SIXTEEN OF THE- OF THE PLAN THAT WE- HANDED OUT. A COVER CONDUCT DEPLOYMENT REMAINS REPRESENTS THE BULK OF OUR HARDING EFFORTS. THEY WERE PLANNING TO DEPLOY AT LEAST SEVEN HUNDRED CIRCUIT MILES IN TWENTY TWENTY WHICH REPRESENTS A SIGNIFICANT. UPTICK FIVE HUNDRED MILES OF IN STOCK FOR THE LAST TWO YEARS. NOW WE'VE OPPOSE IN A GROUP TO PLAN COMPLETE APPROXIMATELY FORTY FIVE HUNDRED MILE CIRCUIT MILES. OF COVER CONDUCTOR BY THE END OF TWENTY TWENTY TWO. NOW OUR ABILITY TO SEXUALIZED AND ISOLATE CIRCUIT SEGMENTS HAS BEEN CRITICAL TO RELIABILITY. AND COUPLED WITH REAL TIME WEATHER STATIONS THIS HELPS REDUCE THE NUMBER OF CUSTOMERS IMPACTED BY PSP YES. THEY WILL CONTINUE TO FIND AND TARGET SECTIONAL ICING FOR CIRCUS TO FURTHER MITIGATE THE IMPACT OF PS PS IN THE FUTURE. NOW OR FOCUSED ON COST EFFECTIVE HARDING SOLUTIONS SUCH AS COVER CONDUCTOR. WE'RE ALSO INCLUDING- SELECTIVE UNDERGRAD IN AREAS TO MEET SPECIFIC CRITERIA FOR EXAMPLE AREAS THAT ARE ROUTINELY HIT BY P. S. P. S. OR AREAS WHERE. THERE CHALLENGES THE INGRESS AND EGRESS. INSTALLATION EXPECTED TO COMMENCE OUR PROGRAM IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE AFTER COMPLETING THE DESIGN AND PERMITTING OF THAT WORK. NOW MOST- IGNITIONS ARE SYSTEM OCCUR WHEN FOREIGN OBJECTS **** TO CONTACT OUR LINES IT'S OVER REMAINS A CORE FOCUS FOR US. NOW WITH EXPANDED OUR TREE LINED CLEARANCE STANDARDS AND CONTINUE TREE REMOVALS UNDER OUR HAS A TREE MITIGATION PROGRAM EACH THE MP. NOW THE FURTHER ARE WHITE WITH FARMERS ONLY SEE ALSO- WE CREATE A FIREBREAK AROUND OUR POLLS AND SOMETHING CALLED THE POLL BRUSHING PROGRAM. NOW ALSO IN TWENTY NINETEEN WE INSPECTED OUR HYPER RISK AREA. IN OUR TWENTY TWENTY PLAN. OUR OBJECTIVE IS TO PRIORITIZE THE RE INSPECTION OF MANY OF THOSE LINES. THE REPRESENT THE HIGHS FIRE RISK BASED ON THE PROBABILITY OF IGNITION AND THE CONSEQUENCES OF THAT IGNITION. THESE STRUCTURES WILL BE INSPECTED ANNUALLY BOTH FROM THE AIR AND ON THE GROUND. AND GOING FOR THE CURRENT REGULATORY REQUIREMENT OF FIVE YEARS AND THREE YEARS- FIVE YEARS FOR DISTRIBUTION OF THREE YEARS FOR TRANSMISSION WILL ALWAYS BE WELL EXCEEDED UNDER THAT PROGRAM. NOW THE NEXT. SO TALK BRIEFLY ABOUT SITUATIONAL AWARENESS I THINK THAT'S A COMMON WE HAVE WITH THE MEN THE UTILITIES THAT WE ARE. LOOKING AT THE NORTH AND SOUTH OF COURSE- THE DEPLOYMENT HIGH DEFINITION CAMERAS IS ESSENTIALLY COMPLETE A SAID A HUNDRED AND SIXTY HT CAMERAS. AT MISSILE SO FAR AND IT PROVIDES IS VISUAL COVERAGE OF SIXTY OR 90% OF OUR SERVICE TERRITORY IN HIGH FIRE RISK AREAS. THAT'S ESSENTIALLY SATURATION GIVEN OUR TOPOGRAPHY AND TERRAIN SO WE REALLY CAN'T GET ANYMORE BENEFIT FROM- IDENTITY HIGH DEFINITION CAMERAS. NOW WE'VE ALSO COMPLETED INSTALLING A HUNDRED AND TO THE FOUR HUNDRED EIGHTY TWO WEATHER STATIONS. AND THESE DEVICES APPROVING CRITICAL- FOR WEATHER MODELING AND FORECASTING AND THIS ALLOWS US TO DO MORE TARGETED DAMAGES ASIANS- IN THE FUTURE. NOW WE'RE PROPOSING TO INSTALL THREE HUNDRED SEVENTY FIVE WEATHER STATIONS EACH YEAR FOR THE NEXT SEVERAL YEARS. THE PART OF OUR PROGRAM. AND OF COURSE WE'RE ALSO CONTINUING DEPLOYMENT A PROMISING NEW TECHNOLOGIES DISTRIBUTION FAULT ANTICIPATION RAPPER EARTH FALL CURRENT LIMITING TECHNOLOGIES. PROBABLY REALLY REALLY PARTLY FOR LEVERAGING THE USE OF BIG DATA MACHINE LEARNING AND ADVANCED ANALYTICS. NOW PORTLY OUR TWENTY TWENTY PLAN WILL INCLUDE SPECIFIC MEASURES TO PROVIDE TRANSPARENCY TO THE PUBLIC AND OTHER STAKEHOLDERS AND WILL ENABLE SI PC TO CLEARLY EVALUATE OUR PROGRESS. THIS TRANSPARENCY BETWEEN UTILITY ARE REGULATORS THE LEGISLATURE AND STAKEHOLDERS IS NECESSARY TO OUR JOINT SUCCESS. THIS WILL LEAD TO A CLEAR UNDERSTANDING OF HOW OUR PROPOSED MEDICATIONS ARE REDUCING RISK AND PROTECTING OUR CUSTOMERS FROM UNNECESSARY COSTS. NOW THE TOPIC OF CUSTOMER COSTS SOMETHING THAT'S A OF DEEP CONCERN TO US ALWAYS. OUR PRESENTATION BECAUSE A BREAKDOWN OF THE INVESTMENTS WERE PROPOSING TO MAKE- IN ARE PLANNED BY CATEGORY. AND THE VAST MAJORITY OF THESE HAVE ALREADY BEEN COLLUDED IN OUR GENERAL RATE CASE WHICH WAS RECENTLY FILED- AND ARE PENDING APPROVAL BEFORE THE CPUC. NOW HISTORICALLY OUR ELECTRICITY RATES HAVE RISEN- ON PAR WITH INFLATION. HOWEVER WITH THIS COMPREHENSIVE INVESTMENT PROGRAM- WE EXPECT TO SEE RATES ABOVE THAT. HOWEVER ACCORDING TO SEE IF YOU SEE PROJECTIONS WILL CONTINUE TO HAVE THE LOWEST SYSTEM AVERAGE RATES. OF THE INVESTOR OWNED UTILITIES IN CALIFORNIA. NINE CLOSING- SAFETY IS AS SEIZE NUMBER ONE PRIORITY- THAT'S MY PARTY THAT'S OUR COMPANIES PRIORITY. SAFE YOUR PUBLIC OUR CUSTOMERS OUR EMPLOYEES AND FIRST RESPONDERS WHO AFTER REACT WHEN THERE ARE FIRES IN OUR SERVICE TERRITORY. NOW LAST YEAR WE MADE SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS THROUGH OUR IMPLEMENTATION COVER AGGRESSIVE TWENTY NINETEEN WHILE FIRE MITIGATION PLAN. FOR TWENTY TWENTY PLAN BILLS ON THE SUCCESS OF LAST YEAR'S EFFORTS AND SIGNIFICANTLY EXPANDS THE SCOPE AND SCALE OF OUR WORK. NOW W APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO SHARE OUR MOVING SWIFTLY IN PARTNERSHIP WITH OUR COLLEAGUES AT IBEW LOCAL FORTY SEVEN. TO REDUCE THE RISK OF WILDFIRES AND ENHANCE THE SAFETY OF OUR PUBLIC. SO WE THANK YOU AND I LOOK FOR YOUR QUESTIONS. THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR HOLDEN AND- GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR HOLDEN AND- COMMITTEE AND ASSEMBLY MEMBERS MY NAME IS DEBBIE PAL I AM THE VICE PRESIDENT OF P. GENIES ASSET RISK MANAGEMENT AND COMMUNITY WHILE FIRE SAFETY PROGRAM. MY RESPONSIBILITIES INCLUDE OVERSEEING MANY OF OUR EXTENSIVE WILD FIRE SAFETY MEASURES I'VE NEARLY THIRTY YEARS OF ENERGY INDUSTRY AND MILITARY EXPERIENCE. WELL I'M NEW TO MY CURRENT ROLE I HAVE BEEN WITH P. JEANNIE FOR A DECADE- SERVING IN SENIOR LEADERSHIP ROLES AND ELECTRIC JANET- ELECTRIC OPERATIONS AND POWER GENERATION. I'D ALSO LIKE TO INTRODUCE MATT PENDER WHO IS THE DIRECTOR OF OUR COMMUNITY WHILE FIRE SAFETY PROGRAM. AND WHILE FIRE MITIGATION PLAN. AS I JOINED THIS TEAM RECENTLY MATT IS HERE TO ANSWER ANY DETAILED QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE. AS AN ENERGY COMPANY THE SAFETY OF OUR- SIXTEEN MILLION CUSTOMERS AND THE COMMUNITIES WE SERVE IS OUR MOST IMPORTANT RESPONSIBILITY. WE NEED TO ACT NOW BECAUSE THE CLIMATE IS CHANGING. P. JEANNIE- SERVICE. HAS CHANGED FROM 15% 252% HI FIRE RISK AREAS THAT'S IN SEVEN YEARS THAT'S A SIGNIFICANT CHANGE. PROLONGED PERIODS OF HIGH TEMPERATURES EXTREME DRYNESS AND RECORD HIGH WINDS HAVE CREATED CONDITIONS AND OUR STATE WHERE ANY SPARK TO CREATE CATASTROPHIC WILDFIRE. AT P. JEANNIE WE ARE TAKING IMMEDIATE AND COMPREHENSIVE ACTIONS TO UPGRADE OUR INFRASTRUCTURE. MONITOR FIRE THREATS IN REAL TIME AN INSTITUTE NEW WILD FIRE SAFETY MEASURES. WE ARE IMPROVING OUR PUBLIC SAFETY POWER SHUT SHUT OFF PROGRAM IN AN EFFORT TO MAKE THE EVENTS SMALLER. SHORTER AND SMARTER WHILE WORKING TO KEEP OUR CUSTOMERS AND COMMUNITY SAFE DURING TIMES OF SEVERE WEATHER. I'M HERE TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTIONS ABOUT HOW ARE WHILE FAR MITIGATION PLAN AND COMMUNITY WHILE FIRE SAFETY PROGRAM WILL HELP REDUCE THE THREAT OF WILDFIRES IN NORTHERN AND CENTRAL CALIFORNIA. I'M SURE WHAT WE ACCOMPLISHED LAST YEAR UNDER TWENTY NINETEEN WILD FIRE SAFETY PLAN AS WELL AS OUR GOALS FOR THIS YEAR. UNDER THE PLAN THAT WE SUBMITTED TO THE CPUC LAST MONTH. I'D LIKE TO START PROVIDING SOME CONTEXT AROUND THE RISK SPECIFIC TO OUR SERVICE AREA AS THE OTHER UTILITIES DID. AS THEY DID SO. SLIDE TO IN YOUR MATERIALS- TALKS TO THE FIRE REX AREAS SO THE CPU SEES COMMISSION AT THE CPU SEES HIGH FIRE THREAT DISTRICT MAP. HIGHLIGHTS HOW BIG THE CHALLENGE IS FOR P. JEANNIE. THAT MAP WAS DEVELOPED IN COORDINATION WITH CALIFORNIA AND BASED ON IMPACT. FROM THE ELECTRIC UTILITIES. COMMUNICATIONS INFRASTRUCTURE PROVIDERS LOCAL PUBLIC SAFETY AGENCIES. SO IT IDENTIFIES AREAS THAT ARE HAVE ELEVATED RISK OTHERWISE KNOWN AS TIER TWO. AN EXTREME RISK SHOWN AS TIER THREE. THIS MAP SHOWS HOW DRAMATIC KLIMEK CLIMATE IMPACTS ARE INCREASING FIRE RISK AND IDENTIFIES AREAS IN THE STATE WHERE THERE ARE ELEVATED AND EXTREME RISKS OF WILDFIRES THAT pWHEN YOU LOOK AT CALIFORNIAN THE TOTALITY OF THE THREE I- USE FOOT PRINTS AND HIGH FIRE THREAT AREAS. OUR SERVICE AREA MAKES UP SEVENTY SIX OF THE SUIT 76% OF THE ELEVATED FIRE RISK FOR THE TIER TWO AREAS AND TIER THREE AREAS. OUR SERVICE TERRITORY IT ALSO HAS THE LARGEST POPULATION OF OVERHEAD CONDUCTORS- POWER LINES IN THE HIGH FIRE THREAT AREAS. WE HAVE OVER TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND MILES OF OVERHEAD DISTRIBUTION LINES WERE ABOUT 65% OF THE TOTAL I OWE YOU OVERHEAD DISTRIBUTION CIRCUIT MILES. IN HIGH FIRE THREAT AREAS. MOVING ON TO THE NEXT SLIDE. YOU CAN SEE IS THE RESULT OF THE- OF SOME OF THE SPECIFIC WILDFIRE RISKS THAT OUR SERVICE TERRITORY YOU CAN SEE THERE'S A REALLY LARGE FORESTED FORESTED SERVICE TERRITORY A MAJORITY OF THE SERVICE THERE IS LOCATED IN ELEVATED OR EXTREME FIRE RISK AREAS AGAIN AS DEFINED BY THE SI PC. AND WE HAVE A GREATER NUMBER OF OVERHEAD POWER LINES. IT'S ALSO WORTH NOTING THAT- CALIFORNIA'S FORCE HAVE SUFFERED GREATLY OVER THE LAST SIX YEARS FROM HISTORIC DROUGHT. ENTRY MORTALITY. ACCORDING TO THE FOREST SERVICE MORE THAN A HUNDRED FORTY SEVEN MILLION DEAD- MILLION TREES HAVE DIED IN OUR STATE SINCE THE DROUGHT BEGAN IN TWENTY TEN. MOVING ON TO SLIDE FOR OUR TWENTY TWENTY WILD FIRE MITIGATION PLANNED BUILDS ON THE WORK WE COMPLETED IN TWENTY NINETEEN I'D LIKE TO TAKE A MINUTE TO SHARE SOME OF THE WORK THAT WE COMPLETED IN NINETEEN. SO WE MADE OUR ELECTRIC SYSTEM STRONGER AND MORE RESILIENT BY INSTALLING. STRONGER AND MORE RESILIENT POLLS COVERED POWER LINES ON A HUNDRED SEVENTY ONE CIRCUIT MILES TWENTY ONE MILES MORE THAN OUR GOAL OF A HUNDRED FIFTY. AND OVER THE NEXT TWELVE TO FOURTEEN YEARS WE WILL HARDEN SEVENTY ONE HUNDRED MILES OF LINE AND HIGH FIRE THREAT AREAS. WE CLEARED VEGETATION AROUND THOUSANDS OF MILES OF POWER LINES THROUGH OUR ENHANCED VEGETATION MANAGEMENT WORK WE PRUNED OR REMOVE TREES WITH THE HIGHER WITH THE HIGHER POTENTIAL FOR WILDFIRE RISK. ALONG NEARLY TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED MILES OF DISTRIBUTION LINES AND THAT EXCEEDED THE GOAL THAT WE SET FOR OURSELVES. WE TURNED ON A HUNDRED AND THIRTY THREE HIGH DEFINITION CAMERAS FOR EARLY SPOTTING OF WILDFIRES. AND THAT'S THIRTY SEVEN MORE THAN OUR GOAL WAS FOR THE YEAR. WE INSTALLED FOUR HUNDRED TWENTY SIX WEATHER STATIONS. EXCEEDING OUR GOAL OF FOUR HUNDRED. WE INSTALLED NEARLY THREE HUNDRED SECTIONAL RISING DEVICES WHICH I THINK WE'RE ALL RELYING ON TO SEPARATE THE GET GRADE INTO SMALL SECTIONS FOR OPERATIONAL FLEXIBILITY. FINALLY IN TWENTY NINETEEN WE ACTIVATED ONE HUNDRED ELEVEN COMMUNITY RESOURCE CENTERS DURING POWER SAFETY PUBLIC SAFETY POWER SHUT OFF EVENTS TO PROVIDE BASIC RESOURCES AND INFORMATION TO OUR CUSTOMERS WE'RE GOING TO EXPAND THAT NUMBER TWO HUNDRED SEVENTY ONE THIS YEAR. MOVING ON TO I DON'T ACTUALLY HAVE A SLIDE FOR THE THESE TALKING POINTS BUT- TO KEEP THE ON POINT NOW I WILL TURN TO OUR CONTINUED ACTIONS THIS YEAR AS PART OF A TO MY COMMUNITY WILD FIRE SAFETY PROGRAM TO HELP KEEP OUR COMMUNITIES A CUSTOMER SAFE. THESE EFFORTS ARE DETAILED IN OUR WILD FIRE MITIGATION PLAN WHICH CHAIR HOLDEN REFERRED TO OUR COMPREHENSIVE PLAN FOR REDUCING WILDFIRE RISKS. FURTHER BUILDS ON THE WORK THAT I JUST DESCRIBED THAT WE COMPLETED IN TWENTY NINETEEN SO TWENTY NINETEEN SERVED AS A FOUNDATION FOR TWENTY TWENTY AND THE YEARS BEYOND. WE ARE INCLUDING NEW GREAT TECHNOLOGY. CONTINUED FOCUSED ON CRITICAL HARDENING OF THE ELECTRIC SYSTEM AND THE ENHANCED VEGETATION- OF MANAGEMENT. A LITTLE BIT MORE THERE WITH THAT SHORT TERM MEDIUM TERM AND LONGER TERM- PLANS TO MAKE OUR SISTER SAFER OUR SYSTEM SAFE THERE. ARE TWENTY TWENTY PLAN OUTLINES THREE MAIN OBJECTIVES FIRST IS REDUCING THE WILDFIRE IGNITION POTENTIAL SECOND AS WE REDUCING THE SPREAD POTENTIAL. AND THEN THIRD AS REDUCING THE IMPACTS OF THE PUBLIC SAFETY POWER SHUT OFFS. I YOUR MATERIAL SLIDE FIVE. SO WE ARE REDUCING THE RISK OF CATASTROPHIC WILDFIRES FROM ELECTRICAL COMPONENTS BY MITIGATING THE KNOWN BECAUSE CAUSES OF IGNITION. THROUGH OUR ENHANCED BADGE MANAGEMENT WE ARE MEETING AND EXCEEDING STATE REGULATIONS FOR AND FIRE SAFETY STANDARDS. WE'RE INSPECTING THE VEGETATION NEAR LINES AND PRUNING OR REMOVING OVER APPROXIMATELY MILLION TREES TO MAINTAIN CLEARANCE FROM OUR POWER LINES. WE'RE CONDUCTING EIGHTEEN HUNDRED LINE MILES OF TWENTY AT TWELVE FOOT RADIO CLEARANCES AND REMOVING HIGH RISK TREES AND OVERHANGS. WE'REEXPANDING RIGHTS AWAY ON OUR LOWER VOLTAGE TRANSMISSION LINES TO REDUCE RISK AND FUTURE FOR PRINCE OF PS PSP BOUNCE. WE'RE FURTHER AUTOMATING OUR SYSTEM BY CONTINUING TO ENABLE DEVICES AND RE CLOSERS BUT ALLOW OPERATORS TO REMOTELY PREVENT A LINE FROM RE ENERGIZING AFTER A FAULT. WE'RE KILEY DATING PILOTING AUTOMATED RAPID EARTH FAULT CURRENT LIMITER TECHNOLOGY IT'S HARD TO SAY FILL JUST SAID THAT- THAT CAN AUTOMATICALLY REDUCE THE ELECTRICAL CURRENT IN A DOWNED WIRE. WERE INCORPORATED ENHANCED INSPECTION PROCESS SEASON TOOLS FROM OUR TWENTY NINETEEN WILD FIRE SAFETY AND PRO IMPROVEMENT INSPECTION PROGRAM INTO OUR ROUTINE INSPECTION PROGRAM. MAR HARDENING OUR SYSTEM BY REPLACING MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED FORTY MILES OF OVERHEAD POWER LINES WITH STRONGER AND MORE RESILIENT POLLS AND COVERED POWER LINES ALONG WITH TARGETED UNDER GROUNDING. FOR IMPROVING SITUATIONAL AWARENESS WE'RE IMPROVING OUR UNDERSTANDING OF UPCOMING AND REAL TIME WEATHER AND FIRE CONDITIONS. TO REDUCE FIRE CONDITIONS RESPOND FASTER AND MINIMIZE THE SCOPE OF PS PS EVENTS. TO FURTHER ADVANCE OUR WEATHER FORECASTING BUILD AT CAPABILITIES WE ARE BUILDING OUR OWN NETWORK OF WEATHER STATIONS TO MONITOR AND FORECAST WEATHER CONDITIONS. BETTER PREDICT WHEN EXTREME WILDFIRE DANGER COULD OCCUR SO WE CAN RESPOND QUICKLY AND APPROPRIATELY TO KEEP OUR CUSTOMERS SAFE. WE'RE ADDING APPROXIMATELY FOUR HUNDRED NEW WEATHER STATIONS THIS YEAR FOR A TOTAL OF THIRTEEN HUNDRED NEW WEATHER STATIONS BY TWENTY TWENTY TWO. AT&amp;T THAT'S DENSITY AS ONE STATION FOR ROUGHLY EVERY TWENTY CIRCUIT MILES AND THE HIGH FIRE RISK AREAS. RENTS TOWING NEARLY TWO HUNDRED. AT NEW HIGH DEFINITION CAMERAS IN HIGH FIRE THREAT AREAS FOR A TOTAL OF NEARLY SIX HUNDRED BY TWENTY TWENTY TWO. AND OUR WILD FIRE SAFETY OPERATIONS CENTER WHICH WE ESTABLISHED IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN MONITORS POTENTIAL WIRE FOR THREATS ACROSS OUR SERVICE AREA IN REAL TIME. AND COORDINATES PREVENTION AND RESPONSE EFFORTS. IN CONCLUSION WE'RE COMMITTED TO WORKING TOGETHER P. JEANNIE OUR GOVERNMENT AND ALL CALIFORNIANS TO ADAPT- ELECTRIC SYSTEM TO THE GROWING THREAT OF WILDFIRES. WHILE ALSO HELPING OUR CUSTOMERS PREPARE FOR PUBLIC SAFETY OUTAGES WE'LL TALK MORE ABOUT PS PS IN THE SECOND HALF. THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR YOUR WE DO APPRECIATE YOUR PRESENTATION THIS MORNING THIS AFTERNOON I'M GONNA TURN TO COMMITTEE AND OUR OUR GUESTS MEMBERS TO SEE IF THEY HAVE ANY QUESTIONS TO ANY OF THE UTILITIES AT PRESENT OR MAYBE THERE'S A QUESTION THAT APPLIES TO ALL THREE FOR RESPONSE BUT ALL TURN TO COMMITTEE MEMBERS IF YOU HAVE ANY. QUESTIONS AT THIS TIME. FOR COMMENTS DUCKWORTH. I KNOW THERE'S CERTAINLY- CONCERNS BY EVERYONE ABOUT THE FACT THAT THE POWERSHOT US BUT- COMPARED TO HAVING TO FIRE I THINK THIS IS THE RIGHT THING I DO APPRECIATE THAT YOU'RE GONNA BE TELLING US ABOUT HOW YOU'RE- TRYING TO DO THEM LESS EXPANSIVELY- SPECTRA. I THINK IT'S JUST EXTREMELY IMPORTANT THAT WE DON'T. THAT EVEN THOUGH WE MAY BE CONCERNED ABOUT THE POWER SHUT OFF THAT YOU CONTINUE TO DO THAT- AND NOT BE. INTIMIDATED FROM DOING THEM WHEN IT'S THE RIGHT THING TO REDUCE RISK I KNOW THAT. IN THE CASES OF RPG AND I'M IN THAT SERVICE AREA- THERE WERE A NUMBER OF- PLACES WHERE THE LINES HAVE BEEN G. ENERGIZED. AND THERE ARE MANY POSSIBLE SITES OF IGNITION SO I THINK WAS THE RIGHT THING TO DO. AND THEM I KNOW YOU'LL BE IMPROVING ON YOUR TECHNIQUES AS TIME GOES ON THANK YOU. FOR FOCUS A LITTLE BIT MORE INTENTLY ON PSP US IN THE NEXT SEGMENT BUT LET ME JUST ASK A QUESTION IN TERMS OF YOU KNOW WHEN ARE WE SAFE. AND THIS IS A PROCESS THAT WE'RE GOING THROUGH AN OBVIOUSLY WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT. AT THE END OF THE DAY THAT THE CUSTOMERS ON ONLY FILL SAY BUT ARE. AND THE DIFFERENT ASPECTS OF WHAT YOU'RE DOING YOU KNOW THEY FIT INTO A- YOU KNOW A- NEED SCHEDULE- THERE'S A POINT. THE WHERE WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO UNDERSTAND HOW WE ARE SAFE AND HOW WE CAN PARSE OUT THESE DIFFERENTPIECES TO HIT TIME FRAMES THAT- WE CAN KIND OF RELY ON- I WAS LOOKING AT THE CHART WHERE IT DESCRIBES. A AND THIS IS JEANNIE BUT I THINK ALL OF YOU HAD REFERENCED IN YOUR YOUR REPORT AT TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND AND RELATES TO- P. JEANNIE TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND CIRCUIT MILES. OF P. JEANNIE SYSTEM ARE LOCATED IN HIGH- FIRE THREAT AREAS- AND THEN THE NEXT- SLIDE OVER HEAD. UNDER ENHANCE VEGETATION MANAGEMENT AS AN EXAMPLE IT DESCRIBES THE TWENTY TWENTY TARGETED EIGHTEEN HUNDRED MILES. LINE MILES- SO HOW. LOOKING AT THE LONG LOOK AT ALL OF THE YEAR THAT YOU HAVE TO COVER IN A LOT OF TO COVER. YOU FOR VIEWING THE LONG TERM IN TERMS OF HOW WE CAN HOW YOU CAN GET TO A PLACE WHERE. YOU'RE ABLE TO DEMONSTRATE TO THE PUBLIC WHEN YOU'RE GOING TO GET THE TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND MILES. LINE MILES- ADDRESS SO THAT THERE'S A SENSE OF TIMING AND WHEN THAT TAKES PLACE AND- HOW THAN WE CAN GET A BETTER SENSE ON. SAFETY SO FOR I THINK YOU KNOW RECOGNITION THAT THE PUBLIC SAFETY POWERSHOT OF EVENTS A REALLY IMPACTFUL TO OUR COMMUNITIES MY FAMILY WHEN IT WENT THROUGH A- P. S. P. S. EVENTS AT OUR HOME. AS WELL AND SO. TOTALLY UNDERSTAND THE IMPACT TO THE COMMUNITIES THERE. AS AS WAS MENTIONED EARLIER RIGHT NOW. THAT'S WHAT PGA ANY BELIEVES WE NEED TO DO I BELIEVE THE OTHER INVESTOR OWNED UTILITIES FEEL THE SAME WHEN THE WEATHER CONDITIONS ARE SUCH THAT IT'S NOT SAFE TO LEAVE THAT THE LINES ENERGIZED THAT WE DE ENERGIZED THEM. I THINK WHAT EVERYBODY REALLY WANTS TO NOW I THINK WHAT YOU'RE GENERALLY ASKING IS- WHEN WILL THE P. S. P. S. EVENTS AND- HARDER TO SAY THAT BECAUSE I THINK WE ALL BELIEVE WE NEED TO HAVE THAT TOOL IS A REAL LAST RESORT IN OUR IN OUR TOOLBOX. BUT THE THINGS THAT WE'RE DOING WITH THE VAJRAYANA JUDGMENT. WITH THE CLEARING AROUND THEIR SIXTY AND SEVENTY KV LINES. WITH THE SECTION THE LACE SEXUAL RISING DEVICES THAT WE'RE PUTTING INTO PLACE TO ISOLATE ONLY THE AREAS THAT ARE GOING TO SEE. THE SIGNIFICANT WEATHER IMPACTS ARE THINGS THAT WE ARE DOING TO ENSURE COMMUNITY SAFETY. YEAH IF MILLIMETERS TO ABOUT TO FIND A POINT IN TERMS OF THE DATES- IN TERMS OF HOW TO COME UP WITH THE DATES FOR COMPLETION OF THE WORK THAT. ADDRESSES THE MAGNITUDE OF THE COVERAGE THE LINES WHICH AND HOW YOU CAN GET TO THAT PONT SO THAT THE PUBLIC KNOWS WHEN YOU WILL HAVE ACCOMPLISHED OF BASED ON TIME FRAMES THE GOAL OF SAFETY AND LINE SECURITY. SO IT'S A GOOD QUESTION THIS IS UNDER FROM EACH ANY AND IT'S GOOD SO THAT WE TALKED A LOT BECAUSE THIS IS THE TO RIGHT YOU WE HAVE THIS MAP THAT WE'VE TALKED ABOUT AND WHAT THOSE LINE MILES ARE WE THE CLAIM IS CONTINUING TO CHANGE AND THAT WILL CONTINUE TO EVOLVE. AND SO WE ARE BEING CONDITIONS WILL CONTINUE TO EVOLVE IN THE EXAMPLE OF ENHANCE VEGETATION MANAGEMENT WE- LAID OUT IN OUR REGULAR OUR GENERAL RATE CASE THAT WE HAD A TEN YEAR PLAN TO GET TO ALL OF THE MILES WITH THIS ENHANCE% VEGETATION MANAGEMENT TREATMENT. BUT WE'RE STARTING WE USE A LOT OF- MODELS TO IDENTIFY WHERE THE HIGHEST RISK AREAS ARE SO IT'S NOT AN EVEN PACE IN TERMS OF RISK REDUCTION WE'RE STARTING IN THE AREAS THAT HAVE THE MOST BANG FOR OUR BUCK IN TERMS OF TREATING THE VEGETATION AND REMOVING RISK. SAME THING ON OUR SYSTEM HARDENING- PROGRAM WHERE WERE HARDENING THE LINES ARE PUTTING THEM UNDERGROUND AND SO- THOSE ARE LONG TERM PROGRAMS RIGHT TEN YEARS TO DO ALL THE VEGETATION MANAGEMENT IS NOT AS FAST AS WE WOULD ALL LIKE IT TO BE. BUT WE'RE USING THE BEST DATA WE HAVE AVAILABLE TO US TO IDENTIFY THE AREAS MOST AT RISK OF AN IGNITION AND MOST AT RISK OF A CATASTROPHIC SPREAD SO THAT WE CAN- AND IMPROVE SAFETY THE FACT IS. IF THE RESOURCES AND- THE BILL IT IS PART. WITH THESE LARGE SCALE PROGRAMS. THANK YOU EXCEPT MAYBE THE ONLY THING SO COME THINGS WILL LIKE TO HAVE THE CON UP. THAT IS A WE'RE ALL WORKING AS HARD AS WE CAN FIND AN ANSWER TO I THERE'S A FEW THINGS WE ARE DEALING WITH A HIGH ENERGY SYSTEM I THINK EVERYBODY REALIZES THAT SO GETTING TO ZERO- I THINK IS- THAT THAT'S THAT'S A LOOSE OF- IN OUR BENCHMARKING WITH OVERSEAS UTILITIES- THEY PROJECTED. AFTER SEVERAL YEARS OF HARDENING UP STILL SEEING NATION'S OTHER SYSTEM I THINK WHAT'S IMPORTANT THOUGH IS THAT WE LOOK AT THIS FROMA RISK STANDPOINT AND IT'S WHAT WE'RE DOING. WE HAVE IN OUR DISTRIBUTION NETWORK IN HIGH FAR RISKIER IS ROUGHLY TEN THOUSAND CIRCUIT MILES. BY THE END OF TWENTY TWENTY THREE- WILL OF COVERED AROUND SIX THOUSAND OF THOSE MILES SO PRETTY RAPID- RAPID COVERING AT THAT INFRASTRUCTURE- BUT MUCH AS MATT SAID- WE'RE NOT DOING THIS IN A- I'D SAY PANCAKE FASHION OR BEING ABOUT FACTION BUT WE'RE DOING IS HIGHLIGHTED WHAT IS THE MOST SIGNIFICANT AREAS IT FIRST. AND FRANKLY THOSE WE'VE ACTUALLY COVERED ALREADY SO THAT SITTING THE THREAT OF EMISSIONS AND ALSO HITTING THE CONSEQUENCE SIDE OF IT RIGHT AWAY- THERE ARE OTHER VARIABLES I THINK THE LATEST OUR THE UTILITY BECAUSE- OR YOU TO. AROUND 10% WHILE FIVE SO THAT ANOTHER FACTOR. WHAT WE ALL THE SCENE AND I THINK WHAT WE CAN TO LEAVE IT SHARE THE WITH WITH THE SAN IS. MANY PIECES TO UTILITY IN. DRIVING THOSE TWO ZERO QUICK AS WE CAN AND USING OUR TARP COLLUDED THAT HARDING PS S. OPERATION PRACTICE VEGETATION MANAGEMENT. FOCUSED THE THINGS WE CAN GET AWAY OF BUDGET TO MANAGE IT PAYS OFF REAL REAL QUICK YOU CAN TURN YOUR WHOLE SYSTEM IN A YEAR AND YOU'VE GOT THE BENEFIT BUT ALSO CONTINUE TO INVEST IN FIVE A RESPONSE KEEP WE'VE SEEN THAT VERY. AND THE OF REACTIONS PURCHASED CAN PLAY A BIG ROLE IN ALL MITIGATING AND GET A ARGUE CENTER IF YOU SAFE AS WELL. I JUST WANT TO- GO BACK TO THE CHAIRS QUESTION BECAUSE I THINK THAT IS. ULTIMATELY THE MOST IMPORTANT THING. THAT WERE RESPONSIBLE FOR WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO TELL THE CUSTOMERS. THAT YOU CAN NEXT YOU CAN EXPECT THAT THIS IS A TIME LINE. YOU'RE RIGHT IT'S NEVER GOING TO BE ZERO. BUT WE HAVE TO HAVE A PLAN TO. GET TWO ZERO AND GET AS CLOSE TO THAT AS POSSIBLE SO. THAT ULTIMATELY IS THE MOST IMPORTANT QUESTION IS. WHAT WAS YOUR QUESTION AGAIN. IS WHEN WE SAY. IT IS WHEN WE SAY WHAT DO WHAT DO WE- WHAT IS A TIME LINE SO THAT WE CAN TELL ARE THE CUSTOMERS. BY THIS TIME WE EXPECT YOU TO BE SAFE. NOBODY FEEL SAFE RIGHT NOW. I I'D I THINK THAT'S A- THAT THAT'S SOMETHING WE'RE ALL WORKING TOWARDS- AND I THINK THIS IS A IS A KEY QUESTION. ON A BRING MAYBE TO THE FOR OUR TWENTY TWENTY WHILE FIRE MITIGATION PLANS AND- AS YOU LOOK TO THOSE- ONE OF THINGS WE'VE BEEN ASKED TO DO IS FORECAST TO DECLINE IN THE NATION'S. NOW IT'S A RELATIVELY STRAIGHTFORWARD A WAY OF APPROACHING IT BUT- BUT LOOKING AT HOW WE'RE PERFORMING IN THE END OF THE ANALYSIS WE NEED TO SEE THAT EVERYTHING WE'RE DOING IS ACTUALLY RESULTING IN FEWER EMISSIONS. AND LOWER CONSEQUENCE WHEN THERE ARE NATIONS- AS WE LOOK TO THESE PLANS AND AS I LOOK AT OUR PLANS WE ARE IN A MUCH BETTER PLACE THAN WE WERE LAST YEAR. WE WILL BE IN A MUCH MUCH BETTER PLACE NEXT YEAR AS WE CONTINUE TO DEPLOY THESE MEDICATIONS AND THAT'S THE PATH AND THAT'S THE JOURNEY WERE ON. WHAT WE DON'T HAVE A DATE OR WE CAN SAY IT'S SAFE BECAUSE I THINK THERE'S SO MANY VARIABLES AND WE'RE INVESTING AND ART AND ART TIME. AND OUR AND OUR EFFORTS IN MAKING SURE WE GET THERE AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE- WE HAVE TO GET THROUGH ANOTHER WILDFIRE SEASON I THINK WE CAN LOOK AT OUR SYSTEM NOW AND SAY. IT IS MUCH SAFER THAN IT WAS LAST YEAR AND WE'RE ONNA CONTINUE IMPROVE ON THAT- AND THAT PROGRESS. THANK YOU. WHAT THANK THANK YOU AND THIS IS JUST A GENERAL QUESTION WHY SHOULD PRIME MORE DIRECTED TOWARD EACH UNIQUE SAYS MY SERVICE SURGERY SO- HOW HOW ARE YOU PRIORITIZING ARE YOU ARE YOU PRIORITIZING THE HIGHEST RISK AREAS AND IT RELATIVE TO SEE PUBLIC SAFETY- HOW ARE YOU HOW ARE YOU PART WHICH ISING ARE USING ARE USING FOR EXAMPLE WE'VE I'M AWARE OF THE COMPANY CALLED TECHNO SOBRE USING INFORMATION FROM TECHNO SILVA OR ARE YOU ARE SO WE ARE WE ARE FOR- FOR PRIDE PRIORITIZING BY OUR WILD FIRE RISK AREAS BY THE POPULATIONS WITHIN THOSE WILD FIRE RISK AREAS WE'RE INCORPORATING AS YOU MENTIONED THE TECHNO SILVA TECHNOLOGY. INTO OUR METEOROLOGY FOR OF CASTLE IT'S NOT JUST WHAT'S THE WEATHER IMPACTS THAT ARE COMING IN BUT ALSO WHAT IS THE POTENTIAL FOR THE WILDFIRE SPREAD THAT CAN OCCUR WITH THAT AND THAT'S THE TECHNO SILVA PEACE. SO WE'RE WE'RE TAKING ALL OF THOSE PIECES WITH A RISK BASED VIEW. TO UNDERSTAND WHERE WE SHOULD BE APPLYING. OUR MEDICATIONS. SO ARE YOU- AND I GUESS AND IS THE FOLLOW UP TO THAT AND THAT'S THE- YOU'RE CREATING- THESE SWITCHING DEVICES OR SORT SECTION. I'M QUITE A MEMBER EXACT TERM USED. AND THE SECTIONAL I THINK THIS ACTUALIZING SO. TO BE ABLE TO REALLY DRILL DOWN AND CUT OFF ONLY THOSE AREAS IT ABSOLUTELY NEED THAT. SO I THOUGHT THAT TECHNOLOGY EGGS EXISTED ALREADY SO I'M KIND OF SURPRISED THAT WERE IN TWENTY TWENTY AND- WE CAN'T REALLY SECTION ALLIES THE GRID LIKE THAT SO- IS THAT THE SAME AND THE OTHER TWO. UTILITY ATLANTIC I SAW ALL SPEAK RIGHT HERE IT REALLY TAKES THE UNDERSTANDING OF THE ENVIRONMENT THE WEATHER. IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE SWITCHING DEVICE THAT ALLOWS YOU TO BE THAT PRECISE SO YOU- BY INSTALLING THE WEATHER STATIONS EARLY IN GETTING THE TEN YEAR HISTORY THAT WE HAVE. WE UNDERSTAND THIS SMALL SEGMENT THAT AFFECTS YOU KNOW JUST THIS HUNDRED CUSTOMERS WHAT THE WEATHER ENVIRONMENT IN CONDITIONS ARE THERE AND THEN. ONCE WE GET INTO AN OPERATIONAL SITUATION WE LOOK AT THE CONDITIONS AND ARE ABLE TO MAKE A REAL TIME DECISION AND OPEN THAT SECTION LIES IN THE VICE THAT'S ASSOCIATED WITH THAT WEATHER STATION. THUS ISOLATING THAT AREA. YOU HAVE A TEN YEAR HISTORY YOU DON'T SO HOW IS THIS GOING TO MAKE US SAFER AND THE NEXT FIVE YEARS. SO FIRST WE'VE BEEN BENCHMARKING WITH BOTH OF THE OTHER UTILITIES AND STEALING SHAMELESS FROM BOTH OF THEM TELL YOU THAT WE'RE WORKING TO MAKE OUR- OUR EVENTS. SMARTER SHORTER AND IS. IN THE WEATHER FORECASTING AND THE TECHNO SILVA TECHNOLOGIES SO WE'RE TAKING OUR WEATHER FORECAST IF YOU IMAGINE OUR SERVICE TERRITORY SEVENTY THOUSAND SQUARE MILES. AND YOU YOU BREAK IT DOWN AND THE PIXELS. LAST YEAR OUR CAPABILITY WAS TO FORECAST WEATHER IN THREE COLLAMER BY THREE KILOMETER PIXELS. THIS YEAR WE'RE REDUCING THAT WE'RE SHRINKING THAT TO BUY TEN CLIMBERS SO- OUR WEATHER FORECASTING COMBINED WITH THE WILDFIRE SPREAD IS GOING TO GIVE US MUCH BETTER- UNDERSTANDING OF WHERE THE AND WHETHER IMPACTS WILL HIT. THEN WITH THE ADDITIONAL SECTIONAL ISING DEVICES WE ARE ABLE TO ONLY ISOLATE THE FOLKS WHO ARE IN THE AREA OF THE SEVERE WEATHER SO THAT'S GONNA MAKE THE EVENTS MUCH SMALLER THEN- WE'RE WE'VE BROUGHT ON ADDITIONAL RESOURCES WE HAVE CONTRACTED HELICOPTERS WERE NEARLY DOUBLING OUR HELICOPTER RESOURCES TO FLY THE LINES TO ENSURE THERE'S NO DEBRIS IN THEM. BEFORE WE RE ENERGIZE THOSE LINES WERE ALSO BRINGING IN SOME FIXED WING AIRCRAFT TO BE ABLE TO PERFORM NIGHT PATROLS FOR OUR TRANSMISSION LINES SO THAT WE CAN RESTORE CUSTOMERS EVEN FASTER AND WE'RE LOOKING TO MOVE THOSE RIGHT RESTORATION TIMES FROM TWENTY FOUR HOURS AFTER THE WIND EVENT ENDS TO TWELVE HOURS. DAHLE YOU'D LIKE THAT I MENTIONED EARLIER IN THE DISCUSSION OF OUR INVESTMENT TRAJECTORY OVER THE LAST. DECADE OR SO OF ELEVEN BILLION DOLLARS. A BIG PART OF THAT WAS THE SECTIONAL RISING WAS PART OF OUR GREAT MODERNIZATION PROGRAM- THEY ON AVERAGE WE HAVE FOUR DEVICES SECTION LIGHTING DEVICES- PER CIRCUIT- SO THAT'S SOMETHING WE'RE EXPLOITING EVEN MORE NOW WE DIDN'T LAST WILDFIRE SEASON LAST PSP IS EVENT- SEASON. ONE OF THESE WERE ALSO BUILDING INTO THE PROGRAM AND IT WILL PROBABLY COME UP A LITTLE BIT LATER DURING THE PS PS DISCUSSION. UP IS ACTUALLY BUILDING EFFECTIVELY AND WHAT IS A PLAYBOOK FOR EVERY SINGLE CIRCUIT SO WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU GET IN THESE EVENTS YOU DON'T KNOW WHERE THEY'RE COMING FROM YOU MAY HAVE- NGUYEN FROM ONE DIRECTION TO ANOTHER DIRECTION A CERTAIN. PORTION OF THE CIRCUIT- RECEIVING THE HIGH WINDS ANOTHER BUT PORTION NOT SO OR DOING FOR BREAKING EACH ONE DOWN SAYING IN THIS SITUATION. THIS IS HOW YOU SEXUAL LIFE THE CIRCUIT SO. INSTEAD OF IN THE EVENT. ASSESSING THE SITUATION AND COMING UP WITHA PLAN WE'RE GONNA MULTIPLE PLANS GOING INTO THE SCENARIO SO WE CAN SECTION LIES MUCH MORE EFFECTIVELY AND WE SEE THAT THAT MAKES A HUGE DIFFERENCE- IT'S- IT'S UP TO HALF THE NUMBER OF CUSTOMERS ON ANY GIVEN CIRCUIT. OR MORE TO BANG ON HOW MUCH. HOW MUCH YOU'RE ABLE TO- TO PARSE THAT OUT IN BIG EVENTS CANDIDLY BIG EVENTS TAKE. MY MORE OF THE CIRCUIT WITHIN THEM SO. REDUCE OPPORTUNITY FOR TWICE BUT THAT WOULD. OKAY THIS MESSAGE. THANK YOU I WANTED TO FOLLOW UP MISTER WOULD SAY QUESTION TO P. JEANNIE AND ADDISON WITH SIR MIGHT ADD HOW DO YOU PRIORITIZE TH WILD FIRE MITIGATION INVESTMENTS AB SO- A VERY VERY SIMILAR STORY- WE'RE USING A KIND OF A PRECURSOR TO TECHNO SILVA WE WILL BE WITH ACT OF CIVIL AS WELL CALL REACTS- IT ASSESSES A NUMBER OF DIMENSIONS INCLUDING POPULATION STRUCTURES- PROPENSITY TO SPREAD WHAT HAPPENS WHEN IT DOES SPREAD. THEN WE MARRY THAT UP WITH SOMETHING THAT WE'VE DONE BILL TO THE MACHINE LEARNING CAPABILITY LURKING LOOKING AT ALL OF OUR DEVICES AND PIECES OF EQUIPMENT SO WHAT WE DO IS WE COMBINE A PROBABILITY OF FAILURE WITH THE CONSEQUENCE OF THAT FAILURE AND WE GET A SCORE AND WE LOOK AT THAT AND BY THE WAY THIS IS ONE OF DIMENSIONS WE USE WE'RE ALSO LOOKING AT HOW OFTEN WAS A CUSTOMER IMPACTED BY P. S. P. S. IS THE MATH IS GREAT IT HELPS US. BUT WE HAVE TO BRING SOME COMMON SENSE OF THESE DECISIONS AS WELL SO WE'RE MARRYING I'D SAY COMPLEX ANALYTIC TOOLS WITH COMMON AN OPERATING HISTORY. TO PRIORITIZE OUR INVESTMENTS OVER TIME. ALL RIGHT. I'D LIKE TO A GOD TURNED TO P. GINNY AND ASK YOU A COUPLE QUESTIONS RELATED TO. THE WILD FIRE SAFETY MITIGATION- INVESTMENTS FIRST OF ALL I I'M NOT TO. FAMILIAR WITH HOW. YOU ACCOUNT FOR THE REVENUES THAT ARE COLLECTED FROM RATE PAYERS SPECIFICALLY FOR WILD FIRE MITIGATION INVESTMENTS EIGHT DO YOU HAVE A SEPARATE ACCOUNTING CAN YOU POINT LIKE ON A SPREADSHEET TO HOW MUCH- REVENUES ARE COLLECTED FROM P. JEANNIE RATE PAYERS FOR WHAT FAR MITIGATION ON VESTMENTS. SO BUT NOT REALLY- AS PART OF OUR- REGULATORY SCHEME WE HAVE RATE CASES ARE GENERAL RATE CASE THE BULK OF OUR WILDFIRE PROGRAMS HAVE BEEN REFLECTED OUR GENERAL RATE CASE. THAT AGGREGATES UP A REVENUE RICARDO REQUIREMENT THAT TURNS INTO- RATES SO WE CAN WE HAVE OF COURSE SEPARATE ACCOUNTING SO WE KNOW WHAT WE SPENT ON DIFFERENT ACTIVITIES INCLUDING A WILDFIRE ACTIVITIES- BUT AND SO THERE'S WAYS TO ESTIMATE. HOW MUCH OF OUR RATES THAT MIGHT BE OR A PERCENTAGE BUT IT'S NOT A DIRECT ONE FOR ONE OKAY SO IN OTHER WORDS- WHEN THE CONCERN WAS RAISED EARLIER ABOUT. ALVY WHAT FOR MITIGATION INVESTMENTS ARE LIKELY TO LEAD TO HIGHER ON- RATES FOR CUSTOMERS. THERE'S NO WAY TO. BREAK DOWN AND WHAT. PORTION OF THE HIGHER RATES ARE GOING TOWARD WILD FIRE MITIGATION INVESTMENTS. NOT DIRECTLY THERE'D RULES OF THUMB AND SORT OF A PERCENTAGE ESTIMATIONS YOU CAN MAKE BUT DOES NOT. STRAIGHT FORWARD OKAY ARM IN TERMS OF THE. OKAY SO- SO BECAUSE THERE'S NO ACCOUNTING FOR AND THERE IS NO OVERSIGHT FROM THE PC IN TERMS OF. THE AMOUNT OF REVENUES WHAT WHAT YOU KNOW WHAT REVENUES- COLLECTED FROM RATE PAYERS ARE GOING TOWARD WHAT FIRED PERCENTAGES AT AS YOU JUST INDICATED AMENDED WE WERE TALKING ABOUT GENERAL PERCENTAGE ESTIMATES SO- IN THIS SPACE THE CPUC REGULATES OUR MANAGES US ON WHAT WE SPEND RIGHT SO THE REVENUE SIDE IS- SOMEWHAT. DISCONNECTED BUT OUR TWENTY TWENTY GENERAL RATE CASE WHICH IS BEING- MANAGED THROUGH THE CPC RIGHT NOW IT'S AN OPEN PROCEEDING HAS SPECIFIC ACCOUNTS WITH SPECIFIC CAPS ASSOCIATE WITH WILD FIRE ACTIVITIES SO FAR VEGETATION MANAGEMENT PROGRAM THERE'S A CERTAIN PROPOSED CAP AND IF WE HAVE TO SPEND MORE THAN THAT THERE'S- A IT KICKS IN ADDITIONAL REVIEW PROCESS SEES. TO MAKE SURE THAT WE WERE SPENDING IT PRUDENTLY AND THINGS OF THAT NATURE SO BALL FOR VEGETATION MANAGEMENT AS WELL AS THE SYSTEM HARDENING ASSET PROGRAMS WE HAVE SPECIAL ACCOUNTING SET UP SO NOT SO MUCH ON THE REVENUE SIDE BUT ON THE SPENDING SIDE ARE WE SPENDING PRUDENTLY THERE ARE VARIOUS AND MULTIPLE- REGULATORY PROCESSES TO SUPPORT THAT. HOW DIFFICULT WOULD IT BE FOR THE- FOR THE PC TO- REQUIRE. PGA TO BREAK DOWN THE- OUR ACTUAL REVENUES- FROM RATE PAYERS THAT ARE BEING USED FOR WHAT FIRE- MITIGATION INVESTMENTS I'M SURE THAT THERE AN ANALYSIS COULD BE PERFORMED TO GET A GOOD ESTIMATE THAT. ARI BUT AS OF NOW IN TERMS OF THE PC OVERSIGHT. IT IS PRIMARILY FOCUSED ON THE EXPENDITURE SIDE AND NOT AND IN TERMS OF THE REVENUES COLLECTED FOR RATEPAYERS AND THE PERCENTAGES I GO TOWARD ONE FAR MEDICATION INVESTMENTS. WHEN I WOULD ADD TO THAT CONVERSATION IS THAT THE WILD FIRE MITIGATION PLAN IN THE PRECEDING THAT WE HAVE BEFORE THE CPUC AS AROUND THE ADEQUACY OF THE MEASURES. THAT WE'RE PUTTING INTO OUR PLANS IN ORDER TO ADDRESS THE WILD FIRE MITIGATION IT'S REALLY THE FOCUS IS NOT ON THE FENCE FINANCIALS BUT IS ON THE ACTIONS IN THE ACTIVITIES THAT THAT UTILITIES ARE UNDERTAKEN. I YEAH I JUST WANT TO. YOU KNOW FLAG. WE HAD A- OUR OUR LAST HEARING WAS ON- THE RISING ELECTRICITY RATES AND SO WELL AS- YOU'RE TELLING US TO EXPECT- EVEN HIGHER RATES WITH THE WITH THE GREATER- AND NEED TO. INCREASE WATER MITIGATION INVESTMENTS IN A WORK AYE. I THINK FOR THE SAKE OF A TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY WELL. WE MAY WANT TO EXPLORE. MEASURES THAT- OR OR STEPS THAT THE PC CAN CAN TAKE AS WELL AS WITH THE LEGISLATURE CAN DO TO BE ABLE TO- SHOW RATE PAYERS LIKE WHY. THE RATES ARE GOING HIGHER AND HOW MUCH OF THAT IS DUE TO THE WATER FOR MEDICATION INVESTMENTS RIGHT RIGHT I THINK THAT'S A I THINK THAT'S- JUST IN THE AIR MARY OF TRANSPARENCY WE WOULD AGREE WITH THAT AYE AYE THERE IS JUST TO BE CLEAR- MANY PLACES WHERE WE ARE- BEING- MAY HAVE CHECKED. YOUR OR WORK WITH THE CBC TO ENSURE THAT WHAT WE'RE SPENDING IS PRUDENT- EVEN THOUGH PURSUANT TO OFFER MITIGATION PLANS WILL BE SUBJECT. AUDITS AND REVIEWS OF THE WORK WE DID TO ENSURE WAS A COMPLETE- WE DID WE DID WE SPEND THE RIGHT AMOUNT OF MONEY ASSOCIATED WITH IT. A TO THE EXTENT THAT THAT FLOWS TO THE REVENUE SIDE BOB THAT'S DID THERE SHOULD BE A CLEAR TRAIL FOR ALL THAT OKAY. I THANK. IT'S BEEN POINTED OUT TO ME THAT A LOT OF WHAT YOU WERE JUST DESCRIBING IS IN YOUR REPORT. THE CENTER EDISON. BUT I THINK. THIS THAT ARE THAT ARE OUT IN TERMS OF WHAT I THINK- ASSEMBLY MEMBER WAS ASKING PHOTOS OF THE BROADCAST AREAS THAT THAT'S THAT WOULD BE OUR THREE POINT EIGHT BILLION DOLLARS OF CAPITAL INVESTMENT PLUS THE ANA. KATA BEFORE WE TRANSITION TO THE THIRD SEGMENT OF THIS HEARING- I JUST WANT TO KIND OF GO BACK TO THE QUESTION THAT WAS REYES WAS FOLLOWING UP ON AND REALLY TRYING TO UNDERSTAND. THAT THE ANSWER WAS AND CONFLATING SORT OF THE EXPECTATION OF MEETING. OUR STATE STATUTE. OF CPUC RULES VERSES ENHANCED WORK. ANY KIND OF THE ENHANCED WORK. IS WERE THE REFERENCE I THINK WAS FOR TEN YEARS AND THAT THAT WAS HOW YOU'RE LOOKING AT. BUT MAYBE YOU CAN BREAK THOSE OUT AND GIVE US A CLEAR UNDERSTANDING OF HOW YOU'RE COMPLYING WITH THE STATUTE AND WITH RULES OF THE CPUC. SEPARATELY FROM- YOUR ENHANCED- WORK AROUND VEGETATION MANAGEMENT AND SOME OF THE THINGS THAT YOU'RE- ALSO TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH UNDER THIS- YOUR WELFARE MITIGATION PLAN. SO ARE THE- ROUTINE OPERATIONS- ARE IN COMPLIANCE WITH ALL OF REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS FOR EXAMPLE THERE WAS A CHANGE IN THE VEGETATION MANAGEMENT RULES AT THE BEGINNING OF TWENTY EIGHTEEN WE HAD. THINK AN EIGHTEEN MONTH WORKING PERIOD TO EXPAND THE CLEARANCE IN CERTAIN AREAS OF OUR SERVICE TERRITORY AND SO WE IMMEDIATELY ADJUSTED OUR PROCESSES TO ACCOMMODATE THAT NEW REQUIREMENT SO OUR ROUTINE OPERATIONS ARE IN LINE WITH- THE COMPLIANCE REGULATIONS AND EXPECTATIONS. LARGELY FROM THE CPC SOME FROM STATE CODE SOME EVEN FROM FEDERAL REGULATION. PRETTY MUCH EVERYTHING IN OUR WELFARE MITIGATION PLAN IS ABOVE AND BEYOND THE COMPLIANCE MINIMUMS RIGHT SO COVERED CONDUCTOR IS NOT A REQUIRED. YOU KNOW CONSTRUCTION MODEL BUT IT'S A PRUDENT ACTIVITY TO UNDERTAKE TO REDUCE THE WILD FIRE RISK SO WE TALK ABOUT TEN YEARS FOR ENHANCE VEGETATION MANAGEMENT SEVENTY ONE HUNDRED MILES OF COVERED CONDUCTOR. THOSE ARE ALL ABOVE AND BEYOND THE COMPLIANCE MEETING STATE MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS- SO I HOPE THAT ANSWERS THE QUESTION THE WAY YOU'RE THINKING. THANK YOU WE'RE WE'RE GONNA TRANSITION NOW- SOME OF WHAT OBVIOUSLY IS- MAJOR PART OF THE CONVERSATION IS UNDER THE SPS BECAUSE WE HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO EXPERIENCE IT AT THE END OF LAST YEAR. AND THERE IT HAD RAISED A LOT OF QUESTIONS AND CONCERNS AND I THINK THAT BETWEEN. THAT TIME AND NOW IT GIVES- YOUR YOUR PLAN SORT OF ADDRESSES HOW THE INTERNALIZATION IS GOING TO WORK BUT ALSO MAYBE JUST REFLECT ON. WHAT HAPPENED AT THE END OF LAST YEAR WHERE YOU'RE SERVICE TERRITORIES WERE IMPACTED AND I KNOW MEMBERS AROUND THE DíAS CERTAINLY WERE LIVING IN REAL TIME. HOW YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT GOING FORWARD AND WE'LL MAYBE LESSONS LEARNED THROUGH THAT PROCESS AND AS WAS POINTED OUT EARLIER WHEN THE SUPERINTENDENT WAS HERE WHAT. IMPACT YOU SEE THAT MIGHT- FALL UPON SCHOOLS AND WHAT YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT IN TERMS OF DRESSING ISSUES OF SCHOOLS THROUGHOUT THE- STATE. OKAY AND SINCE WE DON'T HAVE TO CHANGE ANYONE WOULD JUST GO RIGHT BACK TO THE- ALL RIGHT I WOULD NEED OFF THE AGAIN- JOHN JENKINS OF SAN DIEGO GAS ELECTRIC VICE PRESIDENT ELECTRIC SYSTEM OPERATIONS AND- I'M GOING TO BE- REVIEWING- OF AT A HIGH LEVEL THE EVENTS OF THIS PAST FALL THE LESSONS LEARNED AND THEN. WHAT WE'RE DOING IS IMPROVEMENTS- FROM THOSE LESSONS LEARNED HEADING INTO TWENTY TWENTY SO THE FIRST SLIDE IS JUST COVERING OF. THE RESULTS OF THE PUBLIC SAFETY POWER SHUT OFF EVENTS FROM- TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN. A WE HAD FIVE RED FLAG WARNING EVENTS OCTOBER NOVEMBER- WE- HAD- PS PS IN AND FOUR OF THEM WANT ONE OF THEM WAS NINETEEN CUSTOMERS SO THAT'S NOT LISTED ON HERE- RHYTHM TO SPEND THE BULK OF THE TIME JUST TALKING ABOUT THE OCTOBER THIRTIETH AND THIRTY FIRST EVENT WHICH WAS. A TWENTY SEVEN THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED CUSTOMERS THAT WERE ULTIMATELY- SHUT OFF FOR A PUBLIC SAFETY POWER SHUT OFF- AND THIS MAY GET TO A MEMBER WOODS- CONVERSATION JUST UNDERSTAND HOW WE DO THIS. SO IT WASN'T THE TWENTY SEVEN THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED CUSTOMERS ALL AT ONCE BASED ON A FORECAST WE- WE SENT OUT A NOTIFICATION TO ROUGHLY FORTY THOUSAND CUSTOMERS THAT THEY MAY EXPERIENCE A PUBLIC SAFETY POWER SHUT OFF- THEN AS WE GET INTO REAL TIME- WE MONITOR THE EVENTS CLOSELY. STATION BY STATION. LOOK AT THE WEATHER EVENTS FROM THAT WEATHER STATION AS SOON AS THEY GET ABOVE A THRESHOLD REFILL THE RISK IS TOO GREAT TO LEAVE THE INFRASTRUCTURE ENERGIZED- WE MAKE A DECISION TO SHUT OFF THAT PARTICULAR SEGMENT SO THERE WERE EIGHTY FOUR SEPARATE DECISIONS. AT DIFFERENT TIMES- THAT AVERAGES AROUND THREE IN AND FOR CUSTOMERS A DECISION. TO ULTIMATELY GET TO THAT TWENTY SEVEN THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED AND THAT'S- THAT'S A WAY FOR US TO ONLY IMPACT THE CUSTOMERS THAT NEED TO BE IMPACTED ALSO IT'S A WAY FOR US TO. MAKE SURE WE'RE DOING IT IN A SHORT OF ADORATION AS POSSIBLE. AND JUST THE SAME AS WE DE ENERGIZED THEN WE USE THE SAME FORECAST IN AND- INFORMATION TO IDENTIFY AT WHAT TIME PERIODS IT'LL BE SAFE TO RE ENERGIZE THEM- WE HAVE. THE PRE SCRIPTED US WHICH PLANS AND BOOKS WE KNOW WHAT AREAS NEED TO BE PATROLLED BY HELICOPTER WE WENT WE KNOW WHICH AREAS CAN BE PATROLLED BY FOOT- WE REQUIRE A FULL PATROL- BEFORE WE RE ENERGIZE SOMETHING WE ALSO HAVE CONTRACT FIREFIGHTING RESOURCES IN THE AREA- JUST IN THE EVENT. THAT THAT SOMETHING WERE TO HAPPEN- AND- SO THAT'S WHAT LIMITS ARE- DURATION TO AN AVERAGE CUSTOMER TWENTY FOUR HOURS AND IN THAT EVENT AD THEN THE LONGEST CUSTOMER FOR THAT EVENT WAS WAS THIRTY THREE HOURS. THE PEAK WINDS FOR THAT EVENT WERE SIXTY EIGHT MILES AN HOUR AT ARE STILL HILL WEATHER STATION. WE DEPLOYED SEVEN COMMUNITY RESOURCE CENTERS WHERE WE PROVIDE- ICE WATER PLACES FOR PEOPLE TO CHARGE OUR PHONES TO GET INFORMATION ABOUT THE EVENT- THOSE SORTS OF THINGS INTO COMMUNITY INFORMATION. CENTERS ALONG WITH THAT- I SHOULD'VE SAID IT'S A SHOULD BE A SUCCESSFUL PATROL WE DID FIND TEN DAMAGE LOCATIONS WHERE WE NEEDED TO REMOVE A TREE BRANCH OR OR FIX SOMETHING ON WHENEVER. OVERHEAD POLLS- PRIOR TO RE ENERGIZING THAT SO- AND THAT'S NOT EVEN CAPTURING EVERYTHING THAT COULD HAPPEN YOU CAN HAVE A TREAT. THE FULL CROSS THE LINE BUT ULTIMATELY FELL IN CLEAR ITSELF AND YOU YOU NEVER KNOW WHAT OF WHAT HAPPENED AFTER THE PATROL. MORE WIRE SLAPPING TOGETHER DURING THE EVENT- SO BUT TEN THINGS WE KNEW- THAT HAPPENED THAT NEED TO BE RECTIFIED BEFORE WE CAN RE ENERGISE THE- THE INFRASTRUCTURE SAFELY. AND THEN THE LESSONS FROM A MAN- WE ARE CALM CONSTANTLY TRYING TO CONTINUOUSLY IMPROVE AS WE GO THROUGH THESE EVENTS TO LEARN ABOUT THE INFORMATION ABOUT OUR SYSTEM BUT ALSO WHAT WE CAN DO TO HELP OUR CUSTOMERS- WE HOLD- TOWN HALLS AND ALL THE COMMUNITIES THAT WERE AFFECTED AFTER THE EVENT- I'VE ATTENDED THESE MYSELF WHILE WE LISTEN TO THE CUSTOMERS- IDENTIFY CONCERNS AND THINGS THAT WE CAN DO BETTER WAYS IN WHICH WE CANCOMMUNICATE BETTER- WE HAD NINE. OPEN HOUSES AND SAFETY FAIRS THIS PAST SUMMER WERE WE COORDINATE WITH. OTHER ORGANIZATIONS AND COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS- I WENT TO THE ONE IN ALPINE WHICH IS ONE OF OUR BACK COUNTRY COMMUNITIES- THERE WERE FIVE HUNDRED PEOPLE THERE WITH THIRTY SIX BOOTHS WITH AMERICAN RED CROSS. FIRST RESPONDERS% OBVIOUSLY IN AN S. T. GINNY PRESENCE THERE. A WE LEARNED A LOT OF INFORMATION AT THOSE WITH WITH WHAT OUR CUSTOMERS NEED IN AND WHAT THEY EXPECT- AND THEN WE DO AFTER ACTION REVIEWS AFTER EVERY BAND SO AFTER OUR OCTOBER. AND NOVEMBER ADVANCE WE- HELD TEN DIFFERENT SESSIONS WITH INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL STAKEHOLDERS- CALLOW YES- UP FIRST RESPONDERS LOCAL FIRE AGENCIES WALLS- HOST OF PEOPLE FROM INSIDE AS TEACHING NEED TO. IDENTIFY WAYS THAT WE CAN GET BETTER AT THIS- AND SO HERE'S JUST SOME OF SOME OF THE LESSONS LEARNED BUT- OBVIOUSLY GOING INTO THE EVENT WE SAW WHAT WAS HAPPENING AND SOME OTHER PLACES WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT. OUR WEBSITE WAS ABLE TO HANDLE ANY POSSIBLE TRAFFIC WE CAN ANTICIPATE- GOING THROUGH THE FIRE WEATHER EVENT- OF. THE NEXT FOR BOTH ARE I CAN'T OVER EMPHASIZE ENOUGH- IT'S REALLY ALL THE WORK THAT YOU DO WITH ALL THESE ORGANIZATIONS AND AGENCIES. AND IN COURT IN COURT OFFSEASON. THAT HELPS YOU PERFORM BETTER DURING THE- AND SO WE MEET WITH. NINETY SOMETHING NONPROFIT ORGANIZATIONS OVER TO. AND COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS. WE NEED ALL OUR FIRE AGENCIES ON A REGULAR BASIS. OF ME WITH OFFER FOR SPONSORS LEAST EIGHT. A AND THIS. US ALL NEVER THIS AND THE SAY. BET WITH POSSIBLE FOR THE COMMUNITIES WE SERVE AND IN SOME. THESE LEARNED OFFICE FED INTO THE FOR ADDITIONAL WHETHER STATE AND THIRTY SECTIONAL I DEVICE THAT I DESCRIBED THOSE WERE LESSONS LEARNED ON MORE THE INFRASTRUCTURE SIDE OF THINGS- AND THESE ALL HELP. WITH THIS DISEASE GOAL OF OBVIOUSLY REDUCING THE RISK OF WILDFIRE BECAUSE OUR INFRASTRUCTURE BUT ALSO MITIGATING THE EFFECTS OF. THE S. P. S. IMPACTS AND THEN JUST TO BE A LITTLE BIT MORE SPECIFIC ABOUT THE SOME OF THE THINGS THAT THAT WERE DOING HIS IMPROVEMENTS FOR TWENTY TWENTY ON THE- ON THE LAST SLIDE- I'VE ALREADY TALKED ABOUT THE SECTIONALISM DEVICES IN AND WEATHER STATIONS- I ALSO TALKED ABOUT. THE UNDERGROUND INTO THE COMMUNITY CENTER SO THAT WE'RE GONNA BE DOING AND THE MICRO GRIDS THAT WILL FEED THE COMMUNITY CENTERS THAT WERE NOT UNDERGROUND UNTIL. AND SO FOR THOSE TWO PARTICULAR ITEMS IT'S NOT ABOUT THE SEVEN HUNDRED SEVENTY FOUR AND TWO AND FORTY CUSTOMERS ABOUT WHAT TYPE OF CUSTOMERS THAT THEY ARE. AND SO THOSE ARE LISTED DOWN HERE BELOW WITH THE TWENTY NINE DIFFERENT COMMUNITIES- WE DE ENERGIZED TWENTY THREE SCHOOLS LAST ALL- TEN OF THOSE SCHOOLS WILL REMAIN ON THIS FALL. WE HAVE THE SAME EXACT CONDITIONS THIS YEAR- AS WELL AS EIGHT FIRE STATIONS ONE POLICE STATION AN URGENT CARE FACILITY SIXTY TWO COMMUNICATION SITES IN THE WATER FACILITIES- AND SO THIS THIS PIE CHART IS OBVIOUSLY A MAKING THE ASSUMPTION THAT WE HAVE THE EXACT SAME WEATHER CONDITIONS IN THE EXACT AREAS BUT- OF THE TWENTY SEVEN THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED CUSTOMERS THAT WE DE ENERGIZED LAST YEAR. WITH THESE IMPROVEMENTS WE WOULD OF- SAVE THE- OUTLOOK FOR TO THAT THE QUESTIONS IN THE QUESTION ANSWER SESSION. BOB OKAY- I WILL- PROBABLY BE IN AND OUT OF SOME PREPARED REMARKS AS WELL AS- REFERENCING THE- SLIDE TO CAROL TRY TO GET TO THIS VERY QUICKLY BECAUSE I KNOW THERE'S A MANY QUESTIONS THAT- WE NEED TO ANSWER TODAY- WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE SAME EVENT ESSENTIALLY OCTOBER ANOTHER WAS A DIRECTIVE HERE BUT- I SHOULD POINT OUT THAT WE ALSO BEGIN STANDING UP OUR PS PS EFFORTS- IT AROUND MID SUMMER I THINK JUNE LIKE JUNE WAS THE FIRST TIME WE STOOD UP- WE HAVE A VERY SIMILAR PHILOSOPHY- AS- AS FAR AS- THE ENERGIES ATION- TYPICALLY AS I LOOK OVER THE ENTIRE. SPAN OF- PS PS EVENTS OVER THE YEAR- WE ROUGHLY DE ENERGIZED AROUND 10% OF THE TIME WE NOTIFY SO WE HAVE A AND WE LEAN IN THE NOTIFICATIONS WE THINK EARLY WARNING PREPARATION IS A IS IMPORTANT. THE CONSEQUENCE OF THAT CAN BE NOTIFICATION FATIGUE SO WE'RE WELL AWARE OF THAT BUT WE THINK OF LETTING PEOPLE KNOW IS ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL- SO THE AND- WITH A WERE PRETTY GOOD AT THIS- MY SAID TEN PERCENT- IS PROBABLY ABOUT WHERE WE FEEL WE SHOULD BE RIGHT NOW- AGAIN I MENTION THE FIVE MILLION CUSTOMERS- METERED ACCOUNTS- RELATIVE TO THE WORST- WORST EVENT WE HAD WITH A HUNDRED THOUSAND DE ENERGIZED. IT'S ABOUT 2% OF OUR CUSTOMERS- BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN A LOT TO YOU KNOW THAT ARE OUR SECTIONAL RISING ABILITY IS GREAT WHEN WE ARE. REMAIN ENERGIZED BUT IF YOU'RE NOT- NOT SO GREAT SO THAT'S THE AREA WE'RE SPENDING A LOT OF TIME. OF FOCUSING. I HAVE TO SAY IN AND ONE IN FOR SO. THIS I IN OUR POST. AND WE ALSO WILL NOT RE ENERGIZE UNTIL WE- DO A PATROL OF OUR LINES. WHERE ARE- CRUZ FEEL CREWS HAVE EYES ON THE EQUIPMENT. IT'S VERY IMPORTANT WE CAN'T DO THIS REMOTELY. WE HAVE TO BE THERE TO SEE WHAT'S OUT THERE. AND WHEN WE DID THIS WE FOUND FORTY INSTANCES. OF DAMAGE TO OUR LINES OR VEGETATION ON THOSE LINES THAT WE FEEL COULD HAVE CAUSED. A CATASTROPHIC WILDFIRES. IN IT DID NOT. DID NOT BECAUSE WE DE ENERGIZED AND THAT'S WHY THIS NEEDS TO. REMAIN A KEY PART OF OUR OUR ARSENAL HERE. NOW AGAIN THIS IS IMPORTANT IT'S IMPORTANT PART OF OUR- ARE- MITIGATION EFFORTS- BUT THE MORE OF OUR MITIGATION EFFORTS WE JUST TALKED ABOUT EARLIER COVER CONDUCTOR- THE MORE SECTIONAL RISING THE ADVANCE WEATHER STATIONS- THE LESS. IMPORTANT THAT THIS PARTICULAR TOOL HAS- IN IN THE WAY WE MITIGATE WILDFIRE RISK. WE ALSO HAVE PARTNERED WITH OUR COMMUNITIES OUR FIRST RESPONDERS. NOW WE HAVE TO DEAL WITH FIFTEEN COUNTIES AND SO EACH ONE OF THOSE HAS- THEIR OWN FIRST RESPONDER TEAMS. AS WELL AS CAL FIRE SO IT'S A PRETTY BIG FOOT PRINT. OF FIRST RESPONDERS IN COMMUNITIES WE DEAL WITH BUT WE DO WE ENGAGE WITH THEM VERY ACTIVELY- WERE OUT IN THE COMMUNITY BEFORE EVENTS AND AFTER EVENTS. AND I DO HAVE BEEN- IN- IN THOSE AREAS AFTER A LEADING UP TO EVENTS SO I UNDERSTAND SOME OF THE CONCERNS. OF MANY OF THE CONCERNS AND WE'RE GOING TO ADDRESS THOSE. NOW WE HAVE A SIMILAR- KIND OF RUN UP- BASED ON WHETHER- IT'S- ROUGHLY THREE DAYS BEFORE AN EVENT. HOW WE SEE IT COMING THAT'S WILL NOTIFY- OR FIRST RESPONDER PARTNERS AND- GOVERNMENT AGENCIES. OTHER CRITICAL- INFRASTRUCTURE PROVIDERS- AROUND FORTY EIGHT HOURS IN ADVANCE OF THE VENT IF WE HAVE THE WEATHER FORECASTS TO DEMONSTRATE IT WILL ALSO NOTIFY CUSTOMERS- AGAIN THIS IS THIS IS THE WEATHER- OUR TOOLS ARE ARE VERY GOOD. WE BELIEVE UP BUT IT'S THE WEATHER AND SO THERE ARE TIMES WHEN YOU DON'T HAVE A FORTY EIGHT HOUR NOTIFICATION. AND WE UNDERSTAND THEY CAN BE VERY CHALLENGING TO OUR OUR CUSTOMERS- BUT ALL THIS INFORMATION HELPS US TO MAKE THE KIND OF DECISIONS WE THINK WE NEED TO MAKE IN THE INTEREST OF PUBLIC SAFETY. NOW WE DID LOOK AT LESSONS OR AND I SHOULD SAY WE LOOK AT OCTOBER BUT THE REAL TRUTH OF THIS IS. EVERY SINGLE EVENT THAT WE GO THROUGH IS A LESSONS LEARNED OPPORTUNITY. AND EACH EVENT WHETHER IT'S A SMALL THEN WITHOUT ANYBODY DE ENERGIZED. OR A BIG EVENT- WE LEARN. AND SOME OTHER THINGS THAT WERE BRING TO FOR- WE KNOW THAT DURING THESE EVENTS ARE WEBSITE COULD NOT HANDLE THE TRAFFIC WE FIX THAT. WE'VE UPGRADED OUR SERVERS AND WE CAN HANDLE THE TRAFFIC. AND WE'VE TESTED UNDER THE MOST EXTREME MODELED CIRCUMSTANCE SO WE FIX THAT. ANOTHER BIG AREA WAS OUR CIRCUIT MAPS SO- WE PUT CIRCUIT MAPS UP AND- WE FOUND THAT MOST CUSTOMERS DID NOT SEE A LOT OF MEANINGFUL INFORMATION THERE. SO WE HAVE NOW IS MORE INTERACTIVE SYSTEM YOU CAN PLUG IN YOUR ADDRESS. AND WE'LL TELL YOU WHAT TO EXPECT IF YOU'RE ON THE LIST FOR PSP S. OR IF YOU ARE IN FACT- DE ENERGIZED IF YOU'RE SOMEWHERE ELSE TYPING YOUR ADDRESS IN- ANOTHER KEY AREA. NON SEC CUSTOMERS SO GROUPS SUCH AS RENTERS TENANTS- YOU HAVE A FAMILY MEMBER IN A CERTAIN AREA. WE CAN TYPE IN THE ZIP CODE AND GET AUTOMATIC PS PS NOTIFICATIONS AS WELL SO IT'S PRETTY IMPORTANT PIECE OF INFORMATION. BACK GENERATION SO WE TALKED A BIT ABOUT BACKUP GENERATION WAS FOR A MINUTE MORE THIS. OUR MOST VULNERABLE CUSTOMERS ARE THE ONES THAT WE CALL CRITICAL CARE THEY HAVE MEDICAL DEVICE NEEDS- SO WE ARE- ARE ABOUT. BEGINNING A PROGRAM WHAT WE WILL REIMBURSE CERTAIN INCOME QUALIFIED CRITICAL CARE CUSTOMERS. FOR THE COST OF THE BACKUP BATTERY SO WILL HAVE. TWENTY FOUR HOURS OF CAPABILITY- AND THIS WILL BE PROVIDED AT NO COST TO OUR CUSTOMERS. SO OUR MEN COME QUALIFIED CUSTOMERS THAT FALL IN THE CRITICAL CARE. CATEGORIES SO IT'S A IT'S A BIG AREA OF CONCERN. NOW WE TAKE SPECIAL STEPS WITH THOSE CUSTOMERS. IN THE NOTIFICATION PROCESS IS WE ACTUALLY IF WE DON'T REACH THEM VIA TELEPHONE DURING PSP US. WE WILL SEND ONE OF OUR CREW TO THEIR DOOR. TO KNOCK OUT TO MAKE SURE THEY'VE GOT THE WORD SO WE HAVE A NUMBER OF- WAYS WERE TRYING TO PROTECT- THAT CUSTOMER CLASS. BUT BUT THAT'S IMPORTANT IN BACK OF GENERATION IS ONE OF THEM. THAT WE SHOULD WE MENTION SCHOOLS- OUR TALLY WAS FIFTY FIVE SCHOOLS- THAT WERE DE ENERGIZED- WE KNOW THAT'S FIFTY FIVE SCHOOLS TOO MANY- WE ARE ABOUT TO- OF WE BROKEN GROUND WITH US AND YOU SEE TO HIGH SCHOOL- IN RIVERSIDE COUNTY WITH A- MICROGROOVE PROJECT THERE. IT'S A SOLAR BATTERY UNIT- SO WE WILL ACTUALLY HAVE AN AUTOMATIC BUS TRANSFER THAT WHEN THE GREAT GOES DOWN. IT WILL GO UP SO WE'RE ACTUALLY WORKING. THIS WATER SEWER MOVING FORWARD IN MANY AREAS. NOW THE OTHER PIECE- I'M ABOUT TO CLOSE HERE BUT I DO THINK IT'S IMPORTANT WE MENTION CUSTOMER CARE THAT THE NORMALLY CRITICAL FORCE- BUT THERE'S THE OPERATIONAL PRUDENT AS WELL- I I'D LIKE TO JUST POINT OUT SLIDE TWELVE- WE COVER SOME OF THE AREAS. OF THE KEY KEY BUCKETS OF AREAS. ALLOW FOR MITIGATION- AND THE OPERATIONAL SPACE- AS WELL AS CUSTOMER CARE THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT. I MENTIONED SWITCHING PLAYBOOK SO I WILL COVER THAT ANYMORE HERE- TARGET A GREAT HARDENING. OUR PS PS EXPERIENCE AND EVENTS THAT WE SAW. LAST YEAR. AND NOT JUST IN OCTOBER- AND LET US TO IDENTIFY CIRCUITS THAT ARE FREQUENTLY MORE OFTEN THAN OTHERS DE ENERGIZED. SO WE'RE TARGETING THOSE FOR EXPEDITED. COVERING OF THE CONDUCTOR OR OTHER ENGINEERING FIXES IT COULD BE A SWITCH- IT COULD BE A PEACE UNDERGROUND AND- THERE'S OTHER THINGS WE CAN DO OUTSIDE OF COVERING AND WE'RE LOOKING TO DO THOSE. TO REDUCE THE IMPACT OF THE SPS- DETAILED ENGINEERING SYSTEM OF VALUATIONS WHAT WE CAN EVEN CONFIGURE CIRCUITS IN ADVANCE OF THE HIGH FIRE. RISK SOMETIMES CIRCUITS ARE SUPPLIED FOR RELIABILITY FROM ANOTHER SUBSTATION- BUT SOMETIMES WILL TAKE A RELIABILITY. IN GENERAL TO. PUT THEM THE CIRCUIT THAT BE BE MORE RESILIENT IN A WHILE FAR TO TUITION SO THESE ARE THINGS THAT HAVEN'T. HISTORICALLY DONE WILL DO THAT NOW. OUT MY GRADES PENSION. EARLIER THE- OTHER KEY. THIS IS MY TO ALL THING. BUT WE LOOK JUST AT HE- SWITCHING PLAYBOOKS. AND WE DID A Mà. RELIES ON SAME FOR HAPPENED. YEAR THAT WOULD HAPPEN THIS YEAR SOME KIND OF A ALL THINGS BEING EQUAL- W FOUND THE JUSTICE SWITCHING PLAYBOOKS. COULD TO REDUCE THE IMPACT BY AT LEAST LOT OF THE AREA FOR IMPROVEMENT. THERE ARE MOVING AGGRESSIVELY TO ACCOMPLISH. SO THAT THAT'S REALLY THE PREPARED STATEMENT OF WHAT HAVE WE TAKE THIS REALLY SERIOUSLY. AS A- ENERGY PROFESSIONAL FOR MOST OF MY CAREER- INCLUDING MY- MILITARY EXPERIENCE IS PROBABLY AROUND THIRTY FIVE YEARS- WE MEASURE OURSELVES HAVE HISTORICALLY MEASURE OURSELVES BY RELIABILITY METRICS RIGHT. SOMETHING CALLED SADIE SYSTEM AVERAGE- INSTANT DURATION INDEX HOW OFTEN YOU ARE ONLINE HOW LITTLE TIME YOU SPEND. DE ENERGIZING CUSTOMER SO MAKING A DECISION TO DE ENERGIZE A CUSTOMER IT'S NOT HARD NOT HISTORICALLY IN OUR DNA. BUT PUBLIC SAFETY IS OUR NUMBER ONE OBJECTIVE AND THAT TRUMPS EVERYTHING. AND THAT'S WHY WE HAVE THIS IS A KEY PART OF OUR MITIGATION SUITE. WE UNDERSTAND THIS IS VERY HARD FOR CUSTOMERS AND IT'S HARD FOR OUR COMMUNITIES AND THE AND YOUR OUR FAMILY. WHO HAVE SUBJECT TO A PS PS BUT BUT WE TAKE IT. WE'RE GOING TO GET BETTER- WE'RE COMMITTED TO THAT BUT POINT PART OF THE PROGRAM. THIS IS HOW. MANY SO THIS WE ARE IN. OUR PS PRO. IN A- AND IN AN EFFORT TO MAKE THE- SMALLER SURE. AND SMARTER. WHILE WORKING TO KEEP OUR CUSTOMERS AND COMMUNITY SAFE DURING TIMES OF SEVERE WEATHER AND HEIGHT WILD FIRE RISK. THE SOLE PURPOSE OF THE PUBLIC SAFETY SHUT UP. AS MAKE YOUR UTILITIES OF SAID IS TO REDUCE THE RISK OF CATASTROPHIC WILDFIRES DURING SEVERE WEATHER. OUR GOAL IS TO REDUCE THE NUMBER OF CUSTOMERS THAT ARE IMPACTED AND THE LENGTH OF TIME THAT CUSTOMERS ARE IMPACTED EVERY YEAR. WE WILL REDUCE THE NUMBER OF CUSTOMER IMPACTS THROUGH IMPROVED METEOROLOGICAL DATA AND FORECASTING- SAFELY. MINIMIZING TRANSMISSION IMPACTS AND DEPLOYING CUSTOMER CENTRIC SOLUTIONS INCLUDING TEMPORARY AND PERMANENT GENERATION AT SUBSTATIONS MID FEEDER MICROGRAPHS AND SUPPORTING COMMUNITY ENABLED MICRO GRIDS. BUT WE ARE ALSO SEEKING THE CUT THE RESTORATION TIMES IN HALF AS I MENTIONED EARLIER WITH ADDITIONAL AIR RESOURCES TO AID WITH PATROLLING OF THE LINES AS- ALL OF THE UTILITIES HAVE FOUND EVEN IN THE MOST SEVERE ADVANCE. THERE ARE VEGETATION IMPACTS ON OUR FACILITIES THAT HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO HAVE COST A WILDFIRE. FROM. A CUSTOMER AND COMMUNITY PERSPECTIVE WE ARE LISTENING TO OUR CUSTOMERS ABOUT HOW WE CAN DO BETTER FOR FUTURE EVENTS BY TAKING FEEDBACK AND ACTING ON WHAT WE HEAR. MUCH LIKE OUR MEMBER UTILITIES. FOLLOWING THE OUTAGES IN TWENTY NINETEEN- WE IMMEDIATELY BOLSTERED OUR WEBSITE AND OUR CALL CENTER RESOURCES TO WITHSTAND THE HIGHER LEVEL OF TRAFFIC DURING A P. S. P. S. EVENT AND WILL CONTINUE TO MAKE IMPROVEMENTS- TO THE INFORMATION OF RESOURCES AVAILABLE. WE ARE UPDATING HOW WE ALERT OUR MEMBERS ABOUT PS PSE EVENTS BY SENDING OUT ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ABOUT WHEN POWER WILL BE SHUT OFF FOR SAFETY. AND WHEN IT WILL BE RESTORED. WE'RE WORKING WITH THE LOCAL COMMUNITIES TO IMPROVE THE LOCATIONS THE AVAILABILITY AND RESOURCES PROVIDED AT OUR COMMUNITY RESOURCES. COMMUNITY RESOURCE CENTERS I'VE BEEN ACTUALLY DEPLOYED IN THE MIDDLE OF EVENTS. AND HER DAD DIRECTLY FROM CUSTOMERS WHO WERE HIGHLY FRUSTRATED AT BEING OUT OF POWER- SO VERY FAMILIAR WITH THOSE. CONCERNS UP WE X. ESTABLISHED AN ACCESS AND FUNCTIONAL NEEDS ADVISORY COUNCIL. TO INFORM OUR OUTREACH. PROGRAMS OF RESOURCES FOR THE A. F. AND COMMUNITY AND MEDICALLY SENSITIVE POPULATIONS. WE ARE PARTNERING WITH THE CALIFORNIA FOUNDATION FOR INDEPENDENT LEARNINGS AT LIVING CENTERS TO HELP SERVE THE F. AND COMMUNITY BEFORE DURING AND AFTER A P. S. P. S. EVENT OR OTHER SYSTEM EMERGENCY IN ADDITION TO THE FORMING COLLABORATIONS WITH CAN MEET HE COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS WERE TAKING. OUR ALERTS A STEP FURTHER FOR THE MEDICAL BASELINE CUSTOMERS AS I BE BELIEVE THAT SEAT DOES IF WE DON'T REACH THE CUSTOMER DIRECTLY WE SEND AN EMPLOYEE TO KNOCK ON THEIR DOOR TO MAKE SURE THEY ARE AWARE OF THE COMING PS PS EVENT. BY THE NUMBERS AND TWENTY TWENTY. WE'RE HOSTING A SERIES OF OPEN HOUSES AND WEBINARS TO PROVIDE INFORMATION TO OUR CUSTOMERS AND COMMUNITIES ABOUT OUR TREATMENTS AND PS PS PREPAREDNESS. WE'RE ALREADY WORKING CLOSELY WITH LOCAL STATE AND TRIBAL OFFICIALS TO BE BETTER COORDINATED WITH THE PS PS EVENTS. WERE UTILIZING LISTENING SESSIONS WHICH WE JUST CONCLUDED IN FEBRUARY- WE WILL BE IMPLEMENTING EXERCISES AND PLANNING MEETINGS TO BETTER UNDERSTAND AND ADDRESS CONCERNS AT THE LOCAL LEVEL. READY FOR- THAT'S THE CONCLUSION OF MY PREPARED REMARKS. THANK YOU THE STRESS. I WANT TO ADDRESS MY QUESTION STATUS AND THAT'S MY SERVICE AREA. FIRST AYE AYE I DO WANT TO. THANK EDISON FOR RESPONDING WE HAD LOTS OF PHONE CALLS FROM OUR COMMUNITY DURING THOSE SHUT OFFS- GREAT CONCERN THERE HAD BEEN A COMMUNITY MEETING- IN ONE AREA THAT GOT A LITTLE BIT OUT OF HAND I UNDERSTAND- BUT I APPRECIATED THAT THE SECOND MEETING WITH WITH MY OFFICE. WHO IT WAS IT WAS VERY IMPORTANT FOR THE CUSTOMERS TO HEAR FROM EDISON ABOUT WHAT WAS HAPPENING THE END RESULT MAY NOT HAVE BEEN WHAT THEY WANTED TO HEAR BUT- THE- ONE THING THAT I DO WANT TO KNOW IS. YOUR COMMUNICATION WITH THE MEMBERS OUR OFFICES- THAT ARE IN YOUR SERVICER THIS WOULD GO TO ALL OF YOU TO REACH OUT TO US BECAUSE YOU CAN REST ASSURED THAT WE'RE GETTING THE PHONE CALLS. AND WE WHEN WE ARE TOLD WILL HAVE THEM GO TO THE WEBSITE. YEAH I APPRECIATE THAT YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOUR WEBSITE. DID NOT TAKE CARE OF YOUR CUSTOMERS YOU WEREN'T SET UP FOR THAT TIME AND I'M GLAD THAT THAT HAS CHANGED. AT I THINK THAT WE'RE GOING THROUGH SOMETHING THAT'S NEW- BUT KNOW THAT YOU CAN COUNT ON USWE'RE VERY CONCERNED FOR YOUR CUSTOMERS OUR CONSTITUENTS- THEY THEY REACH OUT TO YOU BUT WHEN THEY DON'T REACH YOU THEY DO REACH OUT TO US. SO I WAS INTERESTED IN KNOWING A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT. YOUR YOUR YOUR PLAN TO. THEY THEY SAY THAT IT'S LIKE A SURGEON'S KNIFE THAT TO YOU YOU WANT TO BE VERY SPECIFIC ABOUT WHERE THE SHUT OFF IS BUT THAT DIDN'T HAPPEN LAST TIME WHAT IS BEING DONE SPECIFICALLY SO THAT IT IS MORE OF A SURGICAL SHUT OFF AS OPPOSED TO JUST SHUTTING OFF THE GRID. IN SOME OF MY CITIES IT WENT FROM HIGH RISK ALL THE WAY DOWN TO DOWNTOWN WHERE. THE CABLES WERE UNDERGROUND SO THERE WASN'T ZERO RISK. WHAT ARE WE DOING WHAT WHAT ARE WHAT IS THAT ISN'T DOING SPECIFICALLY SURE THANK YOU AND THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THAT FEEDBACK TO I THINK WE ARE LEARNING- ABOUT ALL OF OUR CONSTITUENTS- AND WHERE. WE NEED TO BE REACHING OUT MORE PROACTIVELY SO I THINK THAT'S PART OF THE BIG LESSONS LEARNED THAT WE'VE CONTINUED TO BUILD INTO OUR PROGRAM SO THAT REALLY APPRECIATE THAT FEEDBACK- INTO IT IT VERY MUCH ALONG THE LINES OF WHAT I. TALKED ABOUT EARLIER ONE AGAIN IT'S- THE TO DO THIS AND SOMETIMES WE USE THE WORD- PRECISE OR GROUP MUELLER OR SURGICAL- BUT THIS THEME IS THE SAME WHICH IS- THESE CONDITIONS ARE OFTEN VERY DIFFERENT SOME OF OUR CIRCUITS ARE TENS OF MILES LONG- SO AS YOU CAN AND- BEEN A HIGH WINDS THAT. AT ONE SPOT THIS. THE OTHER. AND THE- USER. TO SECTOR. SOMEONE THE TALK ABOUT IS CRITICAL SO THE DEVICE TO BE THE- AND WE'RE PUTTING EVEN MORE THOSE OUT BUT WE ARE. WE THINK WE'RE IN PRETTY GOOD SHAPE THERE WITH AS A SAID AROUND FOUR PER CIRCUIT- BUT THEN MAKING DECISIONS AROUND THAT AND THAT'S WHERE I TALKED ABOUT THE PLAY BOOK SO- FOR EACH OF OUR CIRCUITS IN HIGH FIRE RISK AREAS IN THERE'S OVER A THOUSAND OF THOSE- WE STARTED THIS YEAR. WITH THE ONES THAT WERE- HEAVILY IMPACTED BY PSP US AND WE LOOK AT THOSE FIRST DEVELOP THE PLAYBOOKS THOSE EXIST NOW. AND WE'VE WE'VE DONE THAT FOR THE REST OF THE CIRCUITS AS WELL. SO WE HAVE WHEN WE'RE THE SITUATION BUT WE'RE GOING TO DO- WE ALSO BY THE WAY NOW HAVE A PERMANENT FEATURE OF OUR TEAM DURING SB. SO OUR TYPICAL CRACKED AND WE HAVE BEEN ON THE FEMA MODEL FOR MANY MANY YEARS NOW TERMS OF THE INCIDENT MANAGEMENT TEAM AN INCIDENT COMMAND STRUCTURE- BUT WE HAD A OPERATING SYSTEM THAT WOULD MOBILIZE EVERYBODY NEEDED FOR PS PS- WHEN THOSE EVENTS OCCUR WE NOW HAVE A PERMANENT STAFF THAT IS CONSTANTLY LOOKING AT ALL OF THE CIRCUITS AND HOW TO MANAGE THEM IN PS BECAUSE EVENTS SO THAT'S THAT'S A NEW THING T STARTED LAST PSP A SEASON THEY GOT NEW TOOLS NOW- THEN OF COURSE THE MICRO GRIDS WE TALKED ABOUT HELPING OUR CUSTOMERS WHEN THINGS HAPPEN BECAUSE E SAID SOMETIMES. THE RIGHT DECISION IS DE ENERGIZING THAT CIRCUIT SO YOU GET IT AS SMALL AS YOU CAN AND THEN WHEN YOU HAVE TO BE ENERGIZED SOMEBODY WE HAVE TO TAKE CARE OF OUR CUSTOMERS SO WE HAVE A NUMBER OF CUSTOMER CARE INITIATIVES IN SOME CASES PROVIDING POTABLE WATER IS IN THE ARSENAL IN SOME CASES- IT MAY BE HELPING OUT WITH GENERATORS SO WE'VE GOT A DIFFERENT SUITE OF THINGS THAT WE ARE LOOKING AT DOING IN HELPING OUR CUSTOMERS THROUGH THESE TOUGH SITUATIONS SO. IT HAPPENS ON INFRASTRUCTURE IT HAPPENS WITH CUSTOMER CARE THAT HAPPENS WITH WHETHER THE ONE OTHER THING WE THE DANCE- OUR WEATHER PREDICTION CAPABILITY SIGNIFICANTLY WE- NOW HAVE TO SUPERCOMPUTERS- BOB WE'VE HIRED-FIRE SCIENTISTS THAT WAS ABOUT A YEAR AGO- WHICH WAS KIND OF MARKS WHERE WE ARE AS AN INDUSTRY HAVE BEEN HIRED YOUR OWN FIRE SCIENTISTS KIND OF TOLD YOU WHERE WHERE WE ARE RIGHT NOW- BUT HAVING THAT PREDICTIVE CAPABILITY WITH THE WEATHER STATIONS WILL NEW WEATHER MODELING- PUTS US IN A PLACE THAT WE CAN PRODUCE THESE EVENTS EVEN SOONER. THAN CREWS TO INSPECT MIND AHEAD OF TIME WHICH WE ALWAYS DO MAKE REPAIRS IF WE CAN UP INTO THE EVENT AND THEN MINIMIZING NOT A DISRUPTION THAT DOES HAPPEN WHEN WE DO THE PS BECAUSE ACTIONS. TO OTHER QUESTIONS ABOUT THE STRUCTURE OF THE SECTIONAL ISING THAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT ARE THERE ANY PARTICULAR COMMUTE TO USE THE TERM LOOKING OUT THAT WE CAN SHARE WITH OUR COMMUNITIES YET WE WILL- I DON'T HAVE THE LIST IN FRONT OF ME BUT ARE ARE. TEAMS ARE REACHING TO CAN. AND WHEN WE GO OUT OF THE COMMUNITY WE WILL BE SHARING WITH THEM- SOME SPECIFICS ON WHAT WE'VE DONE. WHAT CIRCUIT WHAT LINES HAVE BEEN COVERED THAT WILL BE AND WHAT WILL SHARE ALL THAT INFORMATION. AND HOW WE'RE THINKING ABOUT THE CHANGES THE P. S. P. S. DOT WHERE WE CAN SUBMIT THEM WE WILL CERTAINLY COMMUNICATE. AGAIN WE WE'RE WE'RE LEVERAGING THE SEGMENT. CAPE ACTUALIZING A TO A GREATER DEGREE THAN WE HAVE IN STORE MANY OF THE DEVICES ALREADY EXIST WHAT IT. WILL USE A MORE- AND WE'LL TALK ABOUT WHERE WE'RE PUTTING THOSE AND SOMETIMES IT TAKES. A COUPLE OF YEARS AND- SOME AREAS WILL. MOVE TO THE FRONT OF THE QUEUE. UP TO GET THAT DONE SOONER BUT- WE CAN GET THAT INFORMATION TO THE COMMUNITIES AND ARE DOING THAT WE HAVE. SCHEDULED EVENTS IN NUMBER THE COMMUNITIES ALREADY FOR MARCH AND APRIL PARTICULAR THE ONES THAT ARE. EXPERIENCE A LOT OF PAIN FROM THE AT THE SPS OFFENSE SO. ONE MAKE SURE WE HAD THIRDS. OF THOSE FOLKS FIRST. IN MY LAST QUESTION IF I MAY. THE GENERATORS I KNOW DURING THE LAST PS PS- A NUMBER OF US WERE PART OF A. CONVERSATION WERE MANY OF YOU OR MANY OF YOUR REPRESENTATIVES WERE WORLD CALLS THERE WAS DISCUSSION ABOUT GENERATORS BEING OFFERED BUT NOT ALL THE ARE YOU USE HAVE THESE AVAILABLE. ARE YOU ALL GOING TO HAVE THOSE IN EDISON SPECIFICALLY- WILL YOU NOW MAKE THOSE AVAILABLE TO- MEMBERS OF THE COMMUNITY THAT ARE ASKING FOR THE GENERATORS. WE ARE MAKING AVAILABLE I WILL SAY THIS IS A GENERALLY CASE BY CASE BASIS IN MANY CASES THESE ARE IN THE INCIDENT- WE DID MAKE- ONE AVAILABLE TO CAL WAS ON ELEMENTARY FOR EXAMPLE TO KEEP THEM OPEN- IT'LL MANY TIMES HIS CONVERSATIONS WITH- WITH OUR COMMUNITY- WE GENERALLY DON'T PROVIDE AN INDIVIDUAL CUSTOMER AT A HOUSEHOLD WITH THE GENERATOR LIKE TO SOME EXTREME NEED AGAIN. THERE CAN BE CASE BY CASE EVENTS- WE DO WANT TO ENCOURAGE OUR CUSTOMER BASE TO DEVELOP. SOME LEVEL OF RESILIENCY AS WELL RECOGNIZING THE FACT THAT PS PS IS ONE OF A NUMBER OF CONDITIONS THAT CAN CAUSE. YOU TO LOSE POWER A LARGE EARTHQUAKE FOR VAN EXAMPLE IS LOOK BECAUSE PROLONGED. THE AND THAT HAVE VERY LITTLE WARNING SO SOME OF RESUME TO BE DOING ENCOURAGE AND WE'VE GOT PRO. BY THE WAY WERE PILOTING A REBATE PROGRAM FOR INDIVIDUAL CUSTOMERS- WHERE THEY CAN- HAVE A REBATE IF THEY PROCURE A GENERATOR- BUT FOR LARGER CUSTOMERS ESSENTIAL USE CUSTOMERS- THERE'S A CONVERSATIONS WILL HAVE IN THE EVENT. AND WE ARE LINING UP GENERATORS IN ADVANCE OF THE EVENTS- AS YOU CAN IMAGINE THAT SUPPLY CHAIN IS AN ISSUE. AND WHAT WE DID SEE IS LAST YEAR- THE EVENTS AT NORTH FIRST- SO THE- GENERATOR POOL WAS- WAS PULLED THERE AND THERE WAS LIMITED AVAILABILITYDOWN SOUTH FOR GENERATORS- DURING SOME OF OUR EVENTS SO. THESE ARE THINGS ARE WORKING THROUGH ONE OF THE LESSONS LEARNED WE BUILT INTO OUR OUR PLANS FOR THIS YEAR. THANK YOU PICTURE. SO I'M BILL QUIRK THE CHAIR HAS TO GO PRESENTED ANOTHER. SO HE COULDN'T STAY AND HE HAS PUT ME TEMPORARILY IN CHARGE. OF MISSED DOCTOR WOULD WOULD WOULD LIKE TO ASK A QUESTION NEXT. THANK YOU THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR YOU'RE DOING A FINE JOB BY THE WAY. OF MY QUESTION IS GONNA BE AROUND- MUNICIPAL UTILITIES SPECIFICALLY NORTHERN CALIFORNIA POWER AGENCY- I HAVE TO MUNICIPAL UTILITIES IN MY DISTRICT. AND ONE OF THE- FRUSTRATIONS WE'VE HAD. IS HAS BEEN COORDINATION AND COMMUNICATION- AS A AS A MEMBER OF THE LEGISLATURE I DON'T LIKE GETTING CALLS FROM MY UTILITY DIRECTOR ST I CAN'T TALK TO ANYBODY A P. JEANNIE. THE PERSON I'M TALKING TO IS A PUBLIC A- OF PUBLIC RELATIONS PERSON. NOT A SYSTEMS PERSON. AND SO AS YOU'RE LOOKING AT CITIES- THAT- HAVE THEIR OWN UTILITY THEY HAVE THEIR OWN LINE CREWS THEY'VE THEY'VE INSPECTED THEIR LINES. IN YET THEY'RE WAITING. A LONG TIME. TO GET RE ENERGIZE WHEN THEY'RE READY TO GO AND SO I WOULD ASK THAT YOU HAVE SOME SORT OF LIAISON SOME SORT OF DIRECT LINK TO GIVE THESE CITIES THERE SIXTEEN. UTILITIES THAT REPRESENT SEVEN HUNDRED THOUSAND PEOPLE IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA- AND I HEARD FROM TWO OF THEM THE ONLY TWO OF MY DISTRICT THAT THEY COULDN'T TALK TO ANYBODY TO GET INFORMATION. SO WHAT ARE YOU DOING TO HELP IN THAT REGARD. SO WITH AND PARTNERING WITH- STATE AND COUNTY ORGANIZATIONS. IN THE TWENTY TWENTY FIRE SEASON WE WILL HAVE P. JEANNIE REPRESENTATIVES IN THEIR LOCAL EMERGENCY OFFICES- THEIR EMERGENCY CENTERS TO. IMPROVE THE COORDINATION AT A LOCAL LEVEL ABOUT WHAT IS GOING ON WITHIN THE P. JEANNIE SYSTEM. THAT THAT THAT THAT'S THAT DOESN'T THAT DOESN'T ANSWER MY QUESTION I'M SORRY- OKAY LET'S TRY AGAIN ARE DO YOU HAVE A LEAK DO YOU ARE THERE IS THERE SOMEONE THAT A SYSTEMS PERSON CAN CALL AND SAY OKAY. HERE WE ARE WE'RE READY TO WE RE ENERGIZED ARE SO WE WE'VE GOT OUR SYSTEM CLEAN- YOU DON'T YOU. CURRENTLY DON'T HAVE THE SEXUALIZATION IN THESE AREAS YEAH SO. I KNOW THAT YOU I KNOW THAT I UNDERSTAND THAT- YOU CONSIDER THE MUNICIPAL UTILITIES A SINGLE CUSTOMER EVEN THOUGH THEY MAY REPRESENT. YOU KNOW IN ONE CASE ELEVEN THOUSAND PEOPLE ANOTHER CASE SIXTEEN THOUSAND AND SO WANT TO CONSIDER THEM ONE PERSON WANT ONE CUSTOMER. AND THAT CUSTOMER IS GOT READY TO GO BUT- FOR WHATEVER REASON YOU DON'T HAVE THE ABILITY TO CALL NUMBER ONE COMMUNICATE WITH THEM. ON AND GIVE THEM REAL TIME INFORMATION AND EVER TO THE FLIP THE SWITCH SO I'M JUST ASKING. BECAUSE IT REPRESENTS NOT ALL SIXTEEN OF THOSE ARE IN HIGH FIRES BUT THAT REPRESENTS SEVEN HUNDRED THOUSAND PEOPLE IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA. SO I'M ASKING WHAT ARE YOU DOING TO MAKE THOSE RELATIONSHIPS. SO THAT THERE IS A WAY FOR PEOPLE TO COMMUNICATE AND GET INFORMATION AND WILL YOU BE LOOKING TO SECTIONAL EYES THOUGH SO THAT BECAUSE THEY'VE ALREADY DONE THE LINE WORK FOR YOU. THEIR LINES ARE CLEAN THEY KNOW THEY'RE CLEAN BECAUSE THEY'VE INSPECTED IN THEMSELVES A YET YEAH THEY'RE WAITING OFTENTIMES MUCH YOU KNOW WELL PASS BIG CITIES AROUND THERE THAT ARE THAT ARE THAT ARE BEING RE ENERGIZED AND THEY'RE NOT BEING RE ENERGIZED. AND IT'S REALLY FRUSTRATING YES YEAH WE UNDERSTAND AND WE APPRECIATE THIS FEEDBACK WE HEARD IT FOR OUR COMMUNITIES THIS WAS SOMETHING WE- CAN DO BETTER THAN WE DID IN TWENTY NINETEEN SO. THERE'S A COUPLE OF ASPECTS WHAT YOU ASKED THEIR ONE IS DO THEY HAVE A- CONTACT SO THEY KNOW WHO TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT WHAT'S HAPPENING IN OUR GRADE- AND WHEN THINGS ARE EXPECTED TO BE RE ENERGIZED. AND SO WE'RE WORKING ON WHAT IT IS. AT THE COUNTY LEVEL WHICH SOMETIMES THESE MUNICIPAL. BY UTILITY ARE PART COUNTY GOVERNMENT WE HAVE YOU'RE WORKING ON THE SINGLE POINT OF CONTACT DEBBIE SHOULD. WORK THESE AS IN THE GOAL TO MARKET AS A- WORKING ON WHAT IS SINGLE CONTACT WE HAVEN'T. FULLY NAIL THAT DOWN YEP WILL HAVE THAT READY BY PM ISN'T WE APPRECIATE THAT THAT'S A NEED THAT WE NEED TO HAVE. THAT WE ASK THAT YOU. YOU KNOW FOR SOME US WHO WHO. SHARE THIS FIRST. THAT YOU GET THAT INFORMATION TO US AS WELL THAT WOULD BE THAT WOULD BE REALLY HELPFUL YEAH- AND DO YOU ARE YOU COUNTING WHEN YOU WHEN YOU'RE LOOKING AT THE- SINCE MY LAST QUESTION- I WITH- WHEN YOU'RE LOOKING HERE THE MOST. IMPACTED MEMBER TAKE YOUR TIME WE SHE AND I ARE THE MOST EFFECTIVE TWO OF YOU THEN. SO YEAH PRETTY SO ARE YOU- WHEN YOU'RE COUNT WHEN YOU'RE COUNTING- AFFECTED PEOPLE ARE YOU IN THE AND THE MUNICIPAL UTILITY AREAS ARE YOU COUNTING THOSE PEOPLE AS AS AS AS AFFECTED OR YOU JUST COUNTING THE ONE CUSTOMER BECAUSE THAT THAT'S THAT'S ALSO ONE CLEAR YEAH SO FOR THE HONEST ANSWERS FOR THE PURPOSES OF OUR STATISTICS- REPORTS IT'S ONE CUSTOMER RIGHT WE APPRECIATE OUR OPERATIONS CENTER IS AWARE THAT THERE ARE MANY MORE CUSTOMERS AND THAT WE HAVE THE SAME SITUATION WITH MASTER METERS AN APARTMENT COMPLEXES AND STUFF THEY SHOW UP AS ONE CUSTOMER BUT WE KNOW. IN SOME CASES OF A MOBILE HOME PARK THERE COULD BE HUNDREDS OF- PEOPLE SOMETIMES VERY SENSITIVE CUSTOMERS BEHIND THAT- ONE METER SO- WE VERY MUCH ABSORBENT INCORPORATE INTO OUR PLANNING HOW TO- GET THOSE AREAS UP FASTER THAT CHALLENGE WITH MANY OF THE MUNICIPALS- MUNICIPAL ELECTRICAL PROVIDERS ELECTRICITY PROVIDERS IS THAT THEY'RE SERVED OFF OF TRANSMISSION LINES RIGHT AND OUR TRANSMISSION LINE ANALYSIS OFTEN TAKES LONGER TO BE REALLY CLEAR ON WHO'S IMPACTED OR WHO'S NOT AND SO WE PUT A LOT OF EFFORT INTO THAT AS WE GO INTO OUR TWENTY TWENTY- PS PS SEASON WERE INSTALLING ADDITIONAL SECTIONAL ISING DEVICES ON OUR TRANSMISSION SYSTEM. AT THE TRANSMISSION LEVEL TO ALLOW US TO CUT UP THAT SYSTEM BUT SOMETIMES REFERRED TO AS THE YOU KNOW BACKBONE SYSTEM TO BE ABLE TO ROUTE REROUTE POWER TO KEEP AND TRANSMISSION LEVEL CUSTOMERS LIKE A MUNICIPAL ELECTRIC PROVIDER ENERGIZED SO THAT'S ONE OF THE ASPECTS THE OTHER THING- DEBBIE MENTIONED BRIEFLY EARLIER WE ARE- ACCORDING TO FIXED WING AIRCRAFT THIS YEAR WITH INFRARED CAMERAS SO THAT WE CAN INSPECT THAT NIGHT WHICH IS USUALLY NOT POSSIBLE- ON OUR SYSTEM BUT WE CAN INSPECT TRANSMISSION LINES AT NIGHT TO GET THE GET THEM CLEARED HAVE HAVE THE POWER TURNED ON FASTER. AND LASTLY. FOR OUT WITH THE LAST ONE WAS GONNA SAY THERE'S ANOTHER TRANSMISSION- EVER WE HAVE IN A WAY BUT I FORGOT IT TO THE PUNCH LINE IS WE APPRECIATE THAT THESE ARE HIGH VALUE. CUSTOMERS EVEN IF IT SHOWS UP ON OUR SYSTEM IS ONE- IT HAS A LARGER IMPACT THAN THAT AND SO WE PUT IN PLACE MANY THINGS. ALL THE LESSONS VEGETATION MANAGEMENT WE'VE EXPANDED OUR VEGETATION MANAGEMENT EFFORT ON TRANSMISSION LINES BECAUSE THAT CAN RAISE THE WIND THRESHOLD OR THE WEATHER THRESHOLD. BEFORE WE HAVE TO TAKE A P. S. P. S. OUTAGE RIGHT BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT A WHOLE TRANSMISSION. THAT THE WHOLE SUBSTATION WOULD BE DOWN IF WE TAKE OUT CERTAIN TRANSMISSION LINES SO WE'RE WE'RE TAKING MANY ANGLES TO TRY TO REDUCE THIS IMPACT WE VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THAT IT WAS. A PAIN POINT OF FOR LARGE CUSTOMERS IN LARGE ME. IN TWENTY. FIVE I APPRECIATE THAT AND I DO LIKE I SAID I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW WHO THOSE CONTACT PEOPLE WILL BE BECAUSE I WANNA BE SURE THAT MY MUNICIPAL UTILITIES. HAVE THAT CONTACT IN MEXICAN TESTED OUT IN ADVANCE BECAUSE- YOU KNOW THE IF THESE ARE TRULY HIGH VALUE CUSTOMERS. THEY SURE DON'T FEEL LIKE IT. RIGHT NOW THEY'RE NOT REAL HAPPY AND I KNOW IT SADLY I KNOW THE TRANSMISSION LINES NOW BETTER THAN I EVER EXPECTED TO KNOW BECAUSE I'VE SPENT TIME WITH THEM AND TRY TO UNDERSTAND AND SOME OF THIS BAFFLE REALLY BAFFLES OF THEM AND BAFFLES ME AS TO WHY THEY WERE EVEN SHUT OFF AND SOME OF THESE CASES AND SO THAT'S WHY THIS SECTION WAS ATION IS SUCH A CRITICAL THINGS SPECIALLY FOR THE MUNICIPAL UTILITIES WHO HAVE LIKE I SAID HAVE DONE THEIR WORK. THEY'RE RELYING ON YOU TO TRANSMIT THE POWER AND THEY'RE THEY'RE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE DISTRIBUTION BUT THEY- THEY'VE BEEN HAD A REALLY HARD TIME COMMUNICATING WITH YOU GUYS AND THAT'S JUST NOT ACCEPTABLE. UNDERSTOOD THANK YOU OKAY JUST TO CLARIFY. THEY WANT HE WANTS. AND IF YOU HAVE MUNICIPAL BE TELLING THESE I THINK IT'S THE SAME THING. THAT THE MUNICIPAL UTILITIES WILL BE ABLE TO TALK DIRECTLY TO A SYSTEMS PERSON. NOT A PR PERSON NOT THE PERSON WHO'S IN THE EMERGENCY CENTER TO SORT OF DO COORDINATION BUT THE SYSTEM'S PERSON. WONDER STANDS THE LINES SO IS THAT CLEAR. THAT IS CLEAR OKAY GOOD. RIGHT. NEXT HIGHLY IMPACTED. I'M SORRY I HAVE P. GINNY INVENT I HAVE FIVE COUNTIES UP AND PLAY LOWER TIME AND FOR LETTER DIFFERENTLY I'M NOT GONNA PINPOINT TOTALLY UP GINNY BUT I WILL SAY I HAVE FAITH THAT I TO FACE.

BY THE PUBLIC SAFETY POWERSHOT OFFICE OVER THE PAST SEVERAL MONTHS AND- WE'RE ALSO HEAVILY INVOLVED IN THE UC- PROCEEDINGS ON BOTH THE WELFARE MITIGATION PLANS AND THE DINNER DE INTERNALIZATION EVENTS AND SO I WON'T GO TOO DEEPLY INTO WHAT OUR COMMENTS HAVE BEEN BUT I WILL STRESS THAT- ONE OF OUR BIG COMMENTS HAS BEEN THAT WE JUST NEED TO KEEP COMMUNICATION GOING EARLY AND OFTEN.

THE COMMUNITY RESOURCE CENTER WE'RE STILL READY TO WERE WITH YOU ON HELPING THOSE UP SO THAT THEY'RE A LITTLE BETTER MANDAN MANAGED THAN THEY WERE IN PREVIOUS EVENTS WE HAD A LOT OF OUR RESIDENTS- COMPLAINING ABOUT. SORT OF NOT THEM NOT BEING ADEQUATE FOR ESPECIALLY THE AFN POPULATIONS TO BE ABLE TO GO AND CHARGE THEIR EQUIPMENT LIKE THEY NEEDED TO- YOU KNOW NEEDING THEM TO BE OPEN TWENTY FOUR HOURS THAT SORT OF THING.

EARLY AND OFTEN- THAT ADMINISTER THOSE FACILITIES- SO THAT THEY CAN GET THE INFORMATION OUT TO THEIR RESIDENTS BECAUSE THE COUNTIES HAVE METHODS TO DO THAT ALREADY IN PLACE- SO THAT THEY CAN GET THAT INFORMATION OUT I THINK IT'S- REALLY. IMPORTANT REALLY CRUCIAL UP FRONT. OKAY THANK YOU THANK YOU. YEAH NEW CREDIT ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA STATUS IS OF COUNTIES- DEFINITELY ONE ECHO WHAT STACY JUST SAID FROM RC RC- OUR MEMBERS ARE IT'S A TOP PRIORITY FOR MEMBERS PARTICULARLY THE P. S. P. S. ISSUE ON IT DEFINITELY IMPACTS A LOT OF OUR MEMBERS CONSTITUENTS- BUT MOVING-FORWARD YOU KNOW THE FOCUS-REALLY THAT WE THINK SHOULD BE ON THE MITIGATION EFFORTS THAT YOU HAVE DETAILED HERE TODAY WAS YOU KNOW REALLY GOOD HERE THE DETAILS ON THAT- AND THAT IN THE EVENT OF HAVING. USE THE P. S. P. S. SHUT DOWN IT SHOULD BE A LAST RESORT- IN IN THOSE CASES YOU KNOW WE SUPPORT- A COUPLE OF A COUPLE THINGS WHEN THIS P. HAS VINCE HAPPENS WHEN DO. I'M THAT BE BETTER SHARING SO RELY TIME ACCURATE INFORMATION FOR OUR YES MANAGERS ARE PUBLIC SAFETY FOLKS AGAIN JUST KIND OF WILL STACY WAS SAYING THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT HELPS US WITH COMMUTING HELPS MANAGE- AND ALSO TO OFFERING TO BE A RESOURCE FOR YOU AS WELL AS YOU KNOW WE HAVE CONNECTIONS AND COMMUNITY- WERE HAPPY COORDINATE WITH YOU ON TRYING TO GET TO A PLACE WHERE YOU KNOW THE NOTIFICATION YOUR PROVIDING ARE HITTING YOU CAN BE THAT YOU NEED THEM. TODAY A BIG OF A PORTION OF THAT IS WHY ON THE COMMITTEE RESOURCE AS WELL- YOU KNOW TRYING TO GET THOSE MORE IN PLACES THAT CAN BE BROADER YOU KNOW A LITTLE BIT MORE HELPFUL FOR CONSTITUENTS ON THE SOMETHING AT THE REPLY WERE FOR MOVING FORWARD BUT WE DO WE STAND READY TO HELP YOU AS PARTNER I'M BECAUSE IT IS A REALLY IN THE AND THE THAT ARE MEMBERS REPRESENT. THANK YOU. YOU HAVE. AND NOT SEE HER NAME. ON BEHALF OF THE U. REFORM THAT. OR TURN JUST. THINGS OUT TURN CURRENTLY IN THE- OF REVIEWING IN DETAIL. ALL OF THE MITIGATION- PLANS AND- OFFICE INVOLVED IN THE PROCEEDINGS- AT THE COMMISSION- WE TAKE VERY SERIOUSLY THE NEED TO. MITIGATE THE RISKS AND PROTECT PUBLIC SAFETY. AND AS WE'RE DOING THIS WORK WE ARE LOOKING AT AND KIND OF WHAT WAS TALKED ABOUT TODAY- THE PART PRIORITIZE YOU KNOW. HOW TO MITIGATE RISK- HOW TO APPROACH IN WHICH AREAS BUT ALSO WHICH TOOLS. ARE GONNA BE MOST EFFECTIVE IN CERTAIN AREAS. UNDER CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES. AND ALSO WHETHER ONE TOOL IS MORE EFFECTIVE- THEN ANOTHER TOOL IN CERTAIN SITUATIONS SO WE HAVE TO BE VERY CAREFUL THAT WE HEAR ABOUT A LOT OF GOOD TOOLS. BUT WE HAVE TO GO MUCH DEEPER THAN THAT THAT'S THE WORK THAT WE'RE DOING RIGHT NOW THE COMMISSION'S MAKE SURE. THAT THE MEDICARE. PLAN TO REALLY PART OF A REALLY- REALLY STRATEGIZE. VERY SPECIFIC- APPROACHES TO MITIGATE THE RISKS. IN IN DOING IN DOING THIS WE'RE LOOKING AT A FEW DIFFERENT THINGS JUST. SOME EXAMPLES- JEANNIE OVERALL PLAN AND- IS ENDING FOUR POINT FIVE BILLION MORE THAN. AND SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA EDISON. AND YET THERE'S LESS MONEY BEING. AND STATE IN. A NUMBER OF THINGS INCLUDING- THE INSULATION OR COVER DOCTORS AND IN YOU KNOW IN OTHER MATTER SO WE- TRY TO. OUT YOU KNOW WHY IT WHY. STRAT ARE BEING EMPLOYED. AT CERTAIN ANSWER NAY. SO THAT'S THAT. THAT WERE DUE RIGHT NOW. WE'RE LOOKING AT WHETHER OR NOT TECHNOLOGY IS BEING UTILIZED A NEW TECHNOLOGIES PROTEIN BROUGHT IN- AT A PACE THAT IS APPROPRIATE- FOR THE RISK THAT IS OUT THERE SO THOSE ARE THINGS THAT WE'RE LOOKING. OUT AND WE'LL BE TALKING ABOUT. LOOKING AT THE REMOVAL OF HEALTHY TREES ALL THAT. BY ITSELF MAY BE A GOOD STRATEGY. BY WHEN YOU LOOK AT OTHER STRATEGIES AND OTHER TOOLS THAT ARE AVAILABLE. YOU KNOW IS THERE IS KIND OF A SLIDING SCALE SHOULD PUT MORE RESOURCES MAYBE INTO SOMETHING ELSE IN CERTAIN AREAS- AS OPPOSED TO MOVING SOME. HEALTHY TREE SO THOSE THE THINGS THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT VERY. AND THE LAST THING A MAN IS KEEP HIM. THAT WERE ALL LOOK AND OTHERS A QUESTION OF SOME. MARK MURATSUCHI ABOUT THE RATE PAYER. I IMPACT WEEK WE OBVIOUSLY HAVE TO LOOK AT THAT AS- AND- ONE ANGLE IT WILL LOOK AT IS. ARE SOME OF THE ACTIVE. ARE THEY REALLY OF NEW MAY. EFFORTS OR THEY JUST SIMPLY. CATCH UP. ON TRYING TO FIX- DISTRIBUTION LINES AND GET AND COMPLIANCE. I'M A WITH MINIMUM STANDARDS THAT SHOULD HAVE ALREADY BEEN MATT. AND MONEY HAD ALREADY BEEN EXPANDED TO DO SOME OF THIS WORK BUT DID BUT NOT ALL THE WORK WAS DONE. SO THOSE ARE THINGS WERE LOOKING AT- AS THE PLANS ARE BEING EVALUATED. OF WHETHER OR NOT SOME OF THIS EVEN FITS INTO MITIGATION PLAN- AND THEN SHOULD BE EVALUATED THAT WAY OR SHOULD BE EVALUATED THAT IS REALLY PLAYING CATCH UP ON WORK THAT WASN'T DONE BEFORE. SO WE'RE DOING THE TOUGH WORK OF ASK THE TOUGH QUESTIONS. ABOUT THE END OF THE DAY TO PROTECT PUBLIC SAFETY BUT ALSO TO PROTECT REPAIR SO WHEN THANK YOU FOR THE WORK TODAY AND- CERTAIN WILL CONTINUE TO ENGAGE WITH BOTH THE COMMITTEE AND ALSO WITH. ALL THE PANELISTS AND COMPANIES ARE INVOLVED. YOU. THANK YOU FOR THIS HEARING TODAY NAME IS. HARMON I'M THE GENERAL. OF GO. ZERO IT'S IN AN- COMPANY. I WOULD I THINK SO THE COMMITTEE MEMBER STAFF.
