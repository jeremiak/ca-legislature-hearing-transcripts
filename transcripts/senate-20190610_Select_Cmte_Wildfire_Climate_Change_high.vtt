00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:02.615
AND TO UPDATE YOU ON THE

00:03:02.682 --> 00:03:04.651
PROGRESS THAT THE NINE OH ONE

00:03:04.717 --> 00:03:06.152
COMMISSION HAS MADE SINCE WE

00:03:06.219 --> 00:03:08.755
LAST CONVENE.

00:03:08.821 --> 00:03:10.590
I THINK SENATOR DODD FOR GIVING

00:03:10.657 --> 00:03:12.325
MORE MORE OF THE BACKGROUND ON

00:03:12.392 --> 00:03:14.027
THE STATUS OF WHERE WE ARE.

00:03:14.093 --> 00:03:15.662
I WON'T REPEAT THE PROCESS

00:03:15.728 --> 00:03:17.430
INFORMATION THAT I SHARED WITH

00:03:17.497 --> 00:03:19.165
YOU AT THE LAST MEETING.

00:03:19.232 --> 00:03:20.767
I'LL JUST HIGHLIGHT THAT.

00:03:20.833 --> 00:03:22.969
AS A SENATOR NOTED WE DID ADOPT

00:03:23.036 --> 00:03:24.904
THE FINAL REPORT ON FRIDAY.

00:03:24.971 --> 00:03:26.239
I WOULD SAY THAT THE FINDINGS

00:03:26.306 --> 00:03:27.774
AND RECOMMENDATIONS THAT WE

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:30.009
ADOPTED WERE VERY SIMILAR TO

00:03:30.076 --> 00:03:32.645
WHAT WAS IN THE DRAFT REPORT.

00:03:32.712 --> 00:03:33.913
AFTER DISCUSSION AMONG THE

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:35.548
COMMISSIONERS WE DID ADD SOME

00:03:35.615 --> 00:03:37.550
ADDITIONAL INFORMATION INTO

00:03:37.617 --> 00:03:37.951
THOSE FINDINGS AND

00:03:38.017 --> 00:03:39.919
RECOMMENDATIONS ARE REGARDING

00:03:39.986 --> 00:03:42.021
CHALLENGES AS WELL AS SOME OF

00:03:42.088 --> 00:03:42.555
THE DIFFERENT LEGAL

00:03:42.622 --> 00:03:44.257
INTERPRETATIONS AND APPROACHES

00:03:44.324 --> 00:03:45.959
ONE MIGHT TAKE -- BUT FOR THE

00:03:46.025 --> 00:03:49.128
MOST PART THEY REMAINED THE SAME

00:03:49.195 --> 00:03:49.696
AND WE CAN GO INTO SPECIFICS

00:03:49.762 --> 00:03:51.331
LATER.

00:03:51.397 --> 00:03:52.599
SO I WAS ASKED JUST TO GIVE AN

00:03:52.665 --> 00:03:54.367
OVERVIEW OF THE COMMISSION'S

00:03:54.434 --> 00:03:57.704
REPORT NOW THAT IT IS PUBLIC.

00:03:57.770 --> 00:03:59.138
AND I APPRECIATE THAT.

00:03:59.205 --> 00:04:00.406
MOST OF YOU HAVE ALREADY READ

00:04:00.473 --> 00:04:01.674
THE REPORT AND IS A LOT IN THERE

00:04:01.741 --> 00:04:04.978
SO I WON'T GO LINE BY LINE.

00:04:05.044 --> 00:04:06.546
GOOD AFTERNOON SENATOR BUT I DID

00:04:06.613 --> 00:04:08.448
WANT TO AT A HIGH LEVEL TOUCH

00:04:08.514 --> 00:04:09.649
UPON OUR FINDINGS AND

00:04:09.716 --> 00:04:12.118
RECOMMENDATIONS.

00:04:12.185 --> 00:04:14.654
SO AT A HIGH LEVEL WE FOUND THAT

00:04:14.721 --> 00:04:16.322
UTILITY COSTS FIRES HAVE BEEN

00:04:16.389 --> 00:04:17.724
SOME OF THE MOST DESTRUCTIVE

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:20.059
FIRES IN THE SUCH UTILITIES MUST

00:04:20.126 --> 00:04:21.661
TAKE A LEADERSHIP ROLE IN

00:04:21.728 --> 00:04:23.763
MITIGATING RISK.

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:25.665
WE ALSO FOUND HOWEVER THAT WILD

00:04:25.732 --> 00:04:27.667
FIRE RISK IS CREATED BY MULTIPLE

00:04:27.734 --> 00:04:29.002
PARTIES WHO SHOULD ALL BE

00:04:29.068 --> 00:04:31.170
INCENTIVIZE TO REDUCE RISK.

00:04:31.237 --> 00:04:32.972
AND SHARING PAYING FOR SOME OF

00:04:33.039 --> 00:04:34.741
THE WILDFIRE DAMAGE.

00:04:34.807 --> 00:04:35.708
AND THAT ALSO INCREASED

00:04:35.775 --> 00:04:37.377
TEMPERATURES AN INCREASE

00:04:37.443 --> 00:04:39.312
POPULATION IN CALIFORNIA.

00:04:39.379 --> 00:04:40.446
HAS EXASPERATED THE AMOUNT OF

00:04:40.513 --> 00:04:41.514
DAMAGE WERE SEEN FROM THESE

00:04:41.581 --> 00:04:44.017
FIRES.

00:04:44.083 --> 00:04:45.418
THE ONE OF THE CHALLENGES THAT

00:04:45.485 --> 00:04:46.986
THE COSTS AND DAMAGES ASSOCIATE

00:04:47.053 --> 00:04:49.155
WITH WILDFIRES ARE NOT WELL

00:04:49.222 --> 00:04:50.890
UNDERSTOOD IN HARD TO PREDICT.

00:04:50.957 --> 00:04:51.958
THE LAST TWO YEARS COULD HAVE

00:04:52.025 --> 00:04:53.159
BEEN AND WANTED TWENTY YEAR

00:04:53.226 --> 00:04:55.461
EXPERIENCE OR A ONE A TWO

00:04:55.528 --> 00:04:55.928
HUNDRED AND FIFTY YEAR

00:04:55.995 --> 00:04:56.863
EXPERIENCE.

00:04:56.929 --> 00:04:58.264
WHICH MEANS THAT WE NEED TO BE

00:04:58.331 --> 00:05:00.099
PREPARING FOR A RANGE OF

00:05:00.166 --> 00:05:01.801
POTENTIAL RISK SCENARIOS

00:05:01.868 --> 00:05:03.236
ESPECIALLY AS WE SEE HOW

00:05:03.302 --> 00:05:05.004
IMPACTFUL THE STATE'S WILD FIRE

00:05:05.071 --> 00:05:07.907
MITIGATION EFFORTS ARE.

00:05:07.974 --> 00:05:09.676
AS A WILDFIRE LIABILITIES

00:05:09.742 --> 00:05:12.278
INCREASE WE FIND THAT UTILITY

00:05:12.345 --> 00:05:13.680
INSURANCE HAS HISTORICALLY THAT

00:05:13.746 --> 00:05:15.281
HAS HISTORICALLY BEEN AVAILABLE

00:05:15.348 --> 00:05:17.083
TO COVER WILDFIRE COST.

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:18.551
IS NOT AVAILABLE AT THE LEVELS

00:05:18.618 --> 00:05:21.020
NECESSARY THERE ARE VERY FEW

00:05:21.087 --> 00:05:22.455
INSURERS IN THE MARKET IN

00:05:22.522 --> 00:05:23.823
PREMIUMS HAVE INCREASED

00:05:23.890 --> 00:05:25.458
SUBSTANTIALLY THESE ARE PREMIUMS

00:05:25.525 --> 00:05:26.926
THAT ARE PAID BY ELECTRICITY

00:05:26.993 --> 00:05:28.561
CUSTOMERS.

00:05:28.628 --> 00:05:30.063
WE ALSO FOUND THAT THE HOME

00:05:30.129 --> 00:05:31.164
INSURANCE MARKET IS BECOMING

00:05:31.230 --> 00:05:32.598
MORE DIFFICULT AND MORE

00:05:32.665 --> 00:05:34.167
EXPENSIVE TO OBTAIN HOME

00:05:34.233 --> 00:05:35.868
INSURANCE AND HIGH WILD.

00:05:35.935 --> 00:05:38.104
AREAS AND THAT EVEN WILD FIRE

00:05:38.171 --> 00:05:40.239
VICTIMS WITH INSURANCE POLICIES

00:05:40.306 --> 00:05:42.041
FACE CHALLENGES INCLUDING HIGHER

00:05:42.108 --> 00:05:45.945
REBUILDING COST AND NON RENEWALS.

00:05:46.012 --> 00:05:47.246
WE HAVE SEVERAL FINDINGS THAT

00:05:47.313 --> 00:05:48.881
REINFORCE THAT GIVEN THE GREATER

00:05:48.948 --> 00:05:50.783
RISK FOR BIGGER FIRES THE STATUS

00:05:50.850 --> 00:05:52.452
QUO IS NOT SUSTAINABLE FOR

00:05:52.518 --> 00:05:54.787
VICTIMS.

00:05:54.854 --> 00:05:56.355
CALIFORNIANS LIVING IN THE FIRE

00:05:56.422 --> 00:05:58.157
AREAS UTILITIES ELECTRIC

00:05:58.224 --> 00:05:59.792
CUSTOMERS.

00:05:59.859 --> 00:06:01.127
FULLER WE FIND THAT THE

00:06:01.194 --> 00:06:03.096
LIABILITY FRAMEWORK THAT ASSIGNS

00:06:03.162 --> 00:06:04.530
COSTS TO UTILITIES REGARDLESS OF

00:06:04.597 --> 00:06:05.998
FAULT.

00:06:06.065 --> 00:06:07.333
LESS SPECIFIC STANDARDS FOR

00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:09.969
UTILITY COST RECOVERY FOR FIRES.

00:06:10.036 --> 00:06:11.571
AND INSURANCE POLICIES THAT DO

00:06:11.637 --> 00:06:13.439
NOT FULLY ADDRESS WILDFIRE

00:06:13.506 --> 00:06:15.742
DAMAGE OR INCORPORATE WILD FIRE

00:06:15.808 --> 00:06:17.043
RISK PREVENTION.

00:06:17.110 --> 00:06:18.277
COLLECTIVELY RESULT IN

00:06:18.344 --> 00:06:19.979
UNCERTAINTY REGARDING THE

00:06:20.046 --> 00:06:22.782
COVERAGE OF COST AND SETTLEMENT

00:06:22.849 --> 00:06:24.016
OF WILDFIRE CLAIMS.

00:06:24.083 --> 00:06:25.384
IT'S ALSO PRESENTS A GREATER

00:06:25.451 --> 00:06:26.919
INVESTMENT RISK AND RISK OF

00:06:26.986 --> 00:06:28.121
BANKRUPTCY FOR CALIFORNIA TO

00:06:28.187 --> 00:06:29.756
LADIES.

00:06:29.822 --> 00:06:31.023
AND ALSO CAN LEAD TO HIGHER

00:06:31.090 --> 00:06:33.025
COSTS FOR ELECTRIC CUSTOMERS WHO

00:06:33.092 --> 00:06:35.661
ALREADY SEEING RISING RATES.

00:06:35.728 --> 00:06:36.963
THE COMBINATION OF THESE FACTORS

00:06:37.029 --> 00:06:38.531
IN CALIFORNIA UTILITIES ACROSS

00:06:38.598 --> 00:06:40.199
THE STATE AND IT'S ALL UTILITIES

00:06:40.266 --> 00:06:41.400
ACROSS THE STATE PUBLIC AND

00:06:41.467 --> 00:06:43.636
PRIVATE.

00:06:43.703 --> 00:06:45.238
RESULT IN OUR UTILITIES BEING

00:06:45.304 --> 00:06:46.472
PERCEIVED AS HIGHER RISK.

00:06:46.539 --> 00:06:48.474
MAKING UTILITY FINANCING AND

00:06:48.541 --> 00:06:50.243
INVESTMENTS MORE EXPENSIVE AND

00:06:50.309 --> 00:06:51.277
WEAKENING THE ABILITY OF

00:06:51.344 --> 00:06:52.645
UTILITIES TO PROVIDE CLEAN

00:06:52.712 --> 00:06:54.247
RELIABLE AND AFFORDABLE ELECTRIC

00:06:54.313 --> 00:06:56.816
SERVICES.

00:06:56.883 --> 00:06:59.018
SO HERE ARE KEY RECOMMENDATIONS.

00:06:59.085 --> 00:07:00.119
WE PLACE THE CURRENT STRICT

00:07:00.186 --> 00:07:01.788
LIABILITY INTERPRETATION OF

00:07:01.854 --> 00:07:03.289
INVERSE CONDEMNATION WITH THE

00:07:03.356 --> 00:07:05.158
FALL BASED STANDARD.

00:07:05.224 --> 00:07:07.493
MAKE CHANGES TO THE STANDARD FOR

00:07:07.560 --> 00:07:08.895
INVESTOR OWNED UTILITY COST

00:07:08.961 --> 00:07:11.531
RECOVERY FOR WILDFIRE COST.

00:07:11.597 --> 00:07:12.832
THAT ACKNOWLEDGE THE NASCENT

00:07:12.899 --> 00:07:15.168
UNDERSTANDING OF PRUDENT ACTION

00:07:15.234 --> 00:07:17.036
FOR WILDFIRE REDUCTION AND

00:07:17.103 --> 00:07:18.337
BETTER ACCOUNT FOR SOME OF THESE

00:07:18.404 --> 00:07:19.839
EXHAUSTION IS FACTORS THAT CAN

00:07:19.906 --> 00:07:21.307
LEAD TO MORE DAMAGE LIKE CLIMATE

00:07:21.374 --> 00:07:23.376
CHANGE.

00:07:23.442 --> 00:07:24.977
IN PARTICULAR REGARDING COST

00:07:25.044 --> 00:07:27.213
RECOVERY WE RECOMMEND ADOPTING

00:07:27.280 --> 00:07:29.749
THE FOR BURDEN OF PROOF STANDARD

00:07:29.816 --> 00:07:30.983
FOR COST RECOVERY.

00:07:31.050 --> 00:07:32.952
REFINEMENT OF THOSE SB NINE A

00:07:33.019 --> 00:07:34.687
ONE FACTORS THAT THE C. P. U. C.

00:07:34.754 --> 00:07:36.289
SHOULD CONSIDER AND ASSESSING

00:07:36.355 --> 00:07:38.090
DISALLOWANCE IS.

00:07:38.157 --> 00:07:40.026
AND A CAP ON MAXIMUM UTILITY

00:07:40.092 --> 00:07:42.361
INVESTOR LIABILITY SOMETHING

00:07:42.428 --> 00:07:43.663
LIKE A STRESS TEST.

00:07:43.729 --> 00:07:44.931
IF YOU TO THE SHAREHOLDERS HAVE

00:07:44.997 --> 00:07:47.533
SUBSTANTIALLY CONTRIBUTED TO

00:07:47.600 --> 00:07:49.569
WILD TO A WILDFIRE FIND.

00:07:49.635 --> 00:07:51.270
WE ALSO RECOMMEND THE CREATION

00:07:51.337 --> 00:07:53.306
OF A WILD FIRE VICTIMS CLAIMS

00:07:53.372 --> 00:07:54.874
PAYING FUND THAT IS BROADLY

00:07:54.941 --> 00:07:56.042
SOURCED.

00:07:56.108 --> 00:07:56.676
INCLUDING FUNDING BY

00:07:56.742 --> 00:07:58.344
SHAREHOLDERS RATE PAYERS AND

00:07:58.411 --> 00:08:00.146
HOMEOWNERS.

00:08:00.213 --> 00:08:01.514
UTILITY SHAREHOLDERS WOULD BE

00:08:01.581 --> 00:08:03.683
REQUIRED TO REPAY BACK THE FUN A

00:08:03.749 --> 00:08:05.084
SPECIFIED AMOUNT IF FOUND TO BE

00:08:05.151 --> 00:08:07.486
IMPRUDENT.

00:08:07.553 --> 00:08:09.222
WE ALSO RECOMMEND OTHER ACTIONS

00:08:09.288 --> 00:08:11.390
TO ENSURE UTILITY ACCOUNTABILITY

00:08:11.457 --> 00:08:13.759
INCLUDING GREATER FIND AUTHORITY.

00:08:13.826 --> 00:08:15.962
WE ALSO MAKE A SERIES OF REFORMS

00:08:16.028 --> 00:08:17.330
RECOMMENDATIONS OF A HOMEOWNER

00:08:17.396 --> 00:08:19.031
INSURANCE MARKET TO MAINTAIN

00:08:19.098 --> 00:08:20.199
AVAILABLE AND AFFORDABLE

00:08:20.266 --> 00:08:21.267
INSURANCE.

00:08:21.334 --> 00:08:22.368
INCLUDING MAINTAINING

00:08:22.435 --> 00:08:24.971
CALIFORNIA'S RISK BASED PRICING

00:08:25.037 --> 00:08:28.241
OF INSURANCE -- AS ONE OF THOSE --

00:08:28.307 --> 00:08:30.042
KEY RECOMMENDATIONS AND THEN

00:08:30.109 --> 00:08:30.943
FINALLY WE OFFER SOME

00:08:31.010 --> 00:08:32.445
RECOMMENDATIONS ON MITIGATING

00:08:32.511 --> 00:08:34.347
FIRE RISK AND BETTER

00:08:34.413 --> 00:08:36.215
STREAMLINING RISK INVESTMENT.

00:08:36.282 --> 00:08:37.917
SPECIFICALLY THE REPORT

00:08:37.984 --> 00:08:38.851
RECOMMENDS THAT WE ADDRESS THE

00:08:38.918 --> 00:08:40.820
DECENTRALIZED -- INCONSISTENT

00:08:40.887 --> 00:08:43.022
WAY IN WHICH WE INVEST IN

00:08:43.089 --> 00:08:45.491
REGULATE WILDFIRE MITIGATION.

00:08:45.558 --> 00:08:47.226
BY CREATING AN ELECTRIC UTILITY

00:08:47.293 --> 00:08:48.995
WILDFIRE BOARD OR ANOTHER

00:08:49.061 --> 00:08:51.030
VEHICLE TO GOVERN UTILITY

00:08:51.097 --> 00:08:53.432
WILDFIRE PREVENTION.

00:08:53.499 --> 00:08:54.667
WE ALSO RECOMMEND TAKING ACTIONS

00:08:54.734 --> 00:08:56.269
TO SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASE

00:08:56.335 --> 00:08:57.737
CONSISTENCY OF PRIVATE PROPERTY

00:08:57.803 --> 00:08:59.105
MAINTENANCE LAWS AND

00:08:59.171 --> 00:09:00.840
FIREFIGHTING SERVICES AVAILABLE

00:09:00.907 --> 00:09:03.276
TO PROPERTIES.

00:09:03.342 --> 00:09:04.844
AND AS I NOTED BEGINNING ON

00:09:04.911 --> 00:09:06.379
FRIDAY WE SPENT A LOT OF TIME

00:09:06.445 --> 00:09:08.114
DISCUSSING THE FACT THAT EACH OF

00:09:08.180 --> 00:09:09.916
THESE RECOMMENDATIONS HAS

00:09:09.982 --> 00:09:11.284
POTENTIAL LEGAL AND

00:09:11.350 --> 00:09:12.818
IMPLEMENTATION CHALLENGES.

00:09:12.885 --> 00:09:14.687
AND THE REPORT EXPANDS UPON US

00:09:14.754 --> 00:09:16.555
SOME OF THOSE BUT I JUST WANTED

00:09:16.622 --> 00:09:17.156
TO HIGHLIGHT SOME OF THOSE FOR

00:09:17.223 --> 00:09:19.458
YOU TODAY. FOR EXAMPLE A STRICT

00:09:19.525 --> 00:09:21.027
LIABILITY THEIR DIFFERENCES A

00:09:21.093 --> 00:09:23.129
LEGAL OPINION REGARDING HOW

00:09:23.195 --> 00:09:24.430
EXACTLY THE LEGISLATURE CAN

00:09:24.497 --> 00:09:26.265
ENACT CHANGES.

00:09:26.332 --> 00:09:27.466
AND WHAT CONSEQUENCES OF ANY

00:09:27.533 --> 00:09:28.734
THERE WOULD BE TO THE HOMEOWNERS

00:09:28.801 --> 00:09:30.670
INSURANCE MARKET WITH THAT

00:09:30.736 --> 00:09:32.905
DIFFERENT INTERPRETATION.

00:09:32.972 --> 00:09:35.007
REGARDING COSTS RECOVERING IT IS

00:09:35.074 --> 00:09:36.542
A CHALLENGE TO ENSURE THAT THE

00:09:36.609 --> 00:09:39.178
CPUC STILL HAS THE AUTHORITY AND

00:09:39.245 --> 00:09:40.846
DISCRETION TO DECIDE REASONABLE

00:09:40.913 --> 00:09:42.148
RATES AND THAT ELECTRIC

00:09:42.214 --> 00:09:44.317
CUSTOMERS AREN'T UNDULY ON THE

00:09:44.383 --> 00:09:45.651
HOOK FOR WILDFIRE.

00:09:45.718 --> 00:09:47.119
ACOSTA THERE'S UTILITIES

00:09:47.186 --> 00:09:48.888
MISMANAGEMENT WHILE PROVIDING

00:09:48.955 --> 00:09:50.623
SOME MORE CERTAINTY TO UTILITY

00:09:50.690 --> 00:09:52.525
INVESTORS REGARDING HOW THESE

00:09:52.591 --> 00:09:54.794
COSTS CLAIMS WILL BE EVALUATED

00:09:54.860 --> 00:09:56.495
AND CONSIDERED.

00:09:56.562 --> 00:09:58.597
AND THEN REGARDING A FIND.

00:09:58.664 --> 00:10:00.700
THE REPORT GOES INTO A LOT OF

00:10:00.766 --> 00:10:01.867
DETAIL ABOUT SOME OF THE

00:10:01.934 --> 00:10:03.869
POTENTIAL CHALLENGES HERE BUT

00:10:03.936 --> 00:10:05.638
THAT INCLUDE NOT PERVERSELY.

00:10:05.705 --> 00:10:07.106
INCENTIVIZE THE RISKY BEHAVIOR

00:10:07.173 --> 00:10:08.574
WE STILL WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT

00:10:08.641 --> 00:10:11.243
HOMEOWNERS GET HOME INSURANCE.

00:10:11.310 --> 00:10:12.611
ONE OF THE CHALLENGES AS WELL AS

00:10:12.678 --> 00:10:13.579
IF YOU WANT A SHAREHOLDER

00:10:13.646 --> 00:10:15.381
CONTRIBUTION HOW IS THAT

00:10:15.448 --> 00:10:17.550
CONTRIBUTION GOTTEN STRUCTURED

00:10:17.616 --> 00:10:19.585
FROM A UTILITY LIKE P. JEANNIE --

00:10:19.652 --> 00:10:21.721
THAT'S GOING THROUGH THE

00:10:21.787 --> 00:10:23.289
BANKRUPTCY PROCESS.

00:10:23.356 --> 00:10:24.156
THEN ALSO ONE KEY COMPONENT OF A

00:10:24.223 --> 00:10:25.458
FINE IS MAINTAINING SETTLEMENT

00:10:25.524 --> 00:10:27.893
VALUE LEVELS A SIMILAR TO WHAT'S

00:10:27.960 --> 00:10:30.463
HAPPENED DOWN IN SOME OF THE

00:10:30.529 --> 00:10:31.497
FIRES TO DATE BETWEEN THE

00:10:31.564 --> 00:10:32.832
SETTLEMENTS TING INSURANCE

00:10:32.898 --> 00:10:34.066
COMPANIES IN THE UTILITIES.

00:10:34.133 --> 00:10:35.067
HOW DO YOU MAINTAIN THE

00:10:35.134 --> 00:10:38.004
SUBROGATION LETTERS LEVELS AND

00:10:38.070 --> 00:10:39.405
PUT THAT INTO LEGISLATION?

00:10:39.472 --> 00:10:40.306
THE KNOWLEDGE THAT IF YOU DON'T

00:10:40.373 --> 00:10:41.841
ADDRESS THESE CHALLENGES THE

00:10:41.907 --> 00:10:43.476
SIZE OF A FIND HOW BIG WOULD

00:10:43.542 --> 00:10:45.411
NEED TO BE COULD BE BIGGER AND

00:10:45.478 --> 00:10:47.313
SO IT'S IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND

00:10:47.380 --> 00:10:49.648
HOW THE STEPS TO BE DONE -- AS

00:10:49.715 --> 00:10:50.149
YOU THINK ABOUT THIS AND

00:10:50.216 --> 00:10:51.751
LEGISLATION.

00:10:51.817 --> 00:10:53.019
I'M SICK ALL THE CHALLENGES WE

00:10:53.085 --> 00:10:55.755
DID NOT GET CONCLUSIVE EVIDENCE

00:10:55.821 --> 00:10:57.356
REGARDING HOW YOU WOULD.

00:10:57.423 --> 00:10:58.290
DEAL WITH THEM AND LEGISLATE

00:10:58.357 --> 00:10:59.859
THEM I THINK THERE ARE SOME GOOD

00:10:59.925 --> 00:11:00.960
IDEAS OUT THERE.

00:11:01.027 --> 00:11:02.194
BUT WE WANTED TO MAKE YOU AWARE

00:11:02.261 --> 00:11:04.230
OF THE CHALLENGES BUT AS A BODY

00:11:04.296 --> 00:11:05.498
WE THOUGHT IT WAS IMPORTANT TO

00:11:05.564 --> 00:11:06.699
TRANSMIT TO YOU.

00:11:06.766 --> 00:11:08.000
AS A BROADER SET OF POSSIBLE

00:11:08.067 --> 00:11:09.969
RECOMMENDATIONS THAT WE THOUGHT

00:11:10.036 --> 00:11:11.203
WOULD BE WORTH WHILE YOU'RE AT

00:11:11.270 --> 00:11:12.738
REVIEW A CONSIDERATION.

00:11:12.805 --> 00:11:14.673
SO WITH THAT THANK YOU FOR YOUR

00:11:14.740 --> 00:11:15.241
TIME I LOOK FORWARD TO YOUR

00:11:15.307 --> 00:11:17.176
QUESTIONS [inaudible]

00:11:17.243 --> 00:11:19.879
QUESTIONS.

00:11:19.945 --> 00:11:21.280
THAT ARE HILL THANK YOU MISTER

00:11:21.347 --> 00:11:22.748
CHAIR AND THE COMMISSION PETER

00:11:22.815 --> 00:11:24.917
AND THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE AND

00:11:24.984 --> 00:11:27.653
FOR YOUR HARD WORK AND A YEAR.

00:11:27.720 --> 00:11:29.555
THE TREMENDOUS DEDICATED PUBLIC

00:11:29.622 --> 00:11:31.724
SERVANT AND THANK YOU FOR THAT.

00:11:31.791 --> 00:11:33.325
I AM CURIOUS ABOUT THE ELECTRIC

00:11:33.392 --> 00:11:35.828
UTILITY WILDFIRE BOARD AND AS IT

00:11:35.895 --> 00:11:38.197
WAS -- POSED IN THE IN THE

00:11:38.264 --> 00:11:40.332
REPORT IT'S NOT REALLY SETS OUT

00:11:40.399 --> 00:11:41.534
RULES AND REGULATIONS AND

00:11:41.600 --> 00:11:43.002
PROCEDURES FOR ALL UTILITIES

00:11:43.069 --> 00:11:44.303
COULD MANDATE RATE YOU KNOW

00:11:44.370 --> 00:11:45.337
THERE'S A WHOLE LIST OF THINGS

00:11:45.404 --> 00:11:47.073
THAT IT CAN DO DEVELOP IN OUR A.

00:11:47.139 --> 00:11:50.242
D. HAVE FINE AND PENALTY IS --

00:11:50.309 --> 00:11:50.910
FORTY BUT ASIDE FROM THE

00:11:50.976 --> 00:11:52.611
INCLUSION OF THE FUEL USED IN

00:11:52.678 --> 00:11:54.880
THE AT THE E. U. W..

00:11:54.947 --> 00:11:56.449
BOARD HOW DOES THIS BOARD DIFFER

00:11:56.515 --> 00:11:58.384
FROM THE CURRENT CHIEF UC.

00:11:58.451 --> 00:12:01.687
OPERATIONS AND RESPONSIBILITIES.

00:12:01.754 --> 00:12:02.822
WE HAD A GOOD DISCUSSION ABOUT

00:12:02.888 --> 00:12:04.757
THIS ON FRIDAY AND THE AUTHORS

00:12:04.824 --> 00:12:06.225
OF THOSE RECOMMENDATIONS REALLY

00:12:06.292 --> 00:12:07.860
HIGHLIGHTED THAT THEY BROUGHT

00:12:07.927 --> 00:12:09.361
THIS IDEA OF A VEHICLE FORD

00:12:09.428 --> 00:12:11.263
BECAUSE OF THE NEED TO FOCUS ON

00:12:11.330 --> 00:12:12.364
THESE ISSUES.

00:12:12.431 --> 00:12:13.799
THAT THERE ARE THESE EFFORTS AS

00:12:13.866 --> 00:12:15.167
YOU NOTED HAPPENING AT THE P.

00:12:15.234 --> 00:12:17.002
YOU SEE AND ARE ALSO HAPPENING

00:12:17.069 --> 00:12:18.637
AT EACH PUBLICLY OWNED UTILITY.

00:12:18.704 --> 00:12:19.772
BUT GIVEN THE URGENCY OF THE

00:12:19.839 --> 00:12:22.174
ISSUE IT MIGHT MAKE SENSE TO

00:12:22.241 --> 00:12:24.376
HAVE A NEW STANDING BODY THAT IS

00:12:24.443 --> 00:12:27.012
CONCENTRATED ON THESE TOPICS --

00:12:27.079 --> 00:12:28.013
IN TERMS OF THE DIFFERENCE FROM

00:12:28.080 --> 00:12:29.615
THE P. YOU SEE AGAIN I THINK IT

00:12:29.682 --> 00:12:31.484
COMES DOWN TO A MATTER OF

00:12:31.550 --> 00:12:33.652
RESOURCES AS MUCH AS ANYTHING --

00:12:33.719 --> 00:12:35.621
IF YOU STATUS IN NEW BOARD THERE

00:12:35.688 --> 00:12:36.956
WOULD OF COURSE BE ATTENTION TO

00:12:37.022 --> 00:12:38.457
WHAT RESOURCES WOULD BE NEEDED.

00:12:38.524 --> 00:12:39.725
THOSE ARE ALSO RESOURCES THAT

00:12:39.792 --> 00:12:41.560
COULD BE DEPLOYED AT THE P. YOU

00:12:41.627 --> 00:12:43.095
SEE AS WELL TO ADDRESS SOME OF

00:12:43.162 --> 00:12:44.663
THESE SAME CONCERNS.

00:12:44.730 --> 00:12:45.397
BUT I THINK WE FELT IT WAS

00:12:45.464 --> 00:12:47.266
IMPORTANT TO RAISE THIS ISSUE

00:12:47.333 --> 00:12:48.134
FOR YOU AND TO THINK ABOUT HOW

00:12:48.200 --> 00:12:50.336
DO YOU ELEVATE IT EITHER WITH AN

00:12:50.402 --> 00:12:52.037
AGENCY OR WITH A NEW BODY.

00:12:52.104 --> 00:12:54.907
WAS THERE ANY TALK.

00:12:54.974 --> 00:12:55.708
WAS THERE ANY DISCUSSION AS TO

00:12:55.774 --> 00:12:57.343
HOW YOU WOULD DEAL WITH SOME OF

00:12:57.409 --> 00:12:59.612
THE IF THERE'S SOME BUT YOU DO

00:12:59.678 --> 00:13:01.347
PRETORIA RULINGS THAT WOULD COME

00:13:01.413 --> 00:13:03.849
FROM THAT AN APPEAL PROCESS OR

00:13:03.916 --> 00:13:05.151
AND HOW THAT WOULD.

00:13:05.217 --> 00:13:06.852
A WITH THE NEW BOARD HOW WITH TO

00:13:06.919 --> 00:13:08.387
PROCESS BE ADMINISTERED IN THERE

00:13:08.454 --> 00:13:09.955
TO GET INTO THE DETAILS OF THAT

00:13:10.022 --> 00:13:11.824
MUCH SURE IT DID NOT GET INTO

00:13:11.891 --> 00:13:13.359
THOSE DETAILS ONE OF THE

00:13:13.425 --> 00:13:14.927
CHALLENGES THAT WE DID DISCUSS

00:13:14.994 --> 00:13:15.895
THOUGH WAS.

00:13:15.961 --> 00:13:18.597
MAKING SURE WE DON'T HAVE. TWO

00:13:18.664 --> 00:13:20.099
DIFFERENT REGULATORS THEY'LL BE

00:13:20.166 --> 00:13:22.034
OPINING ON THE SAME ISSUE AND WE

00:13:22.101 --> 00:13:23.302
APPRECIATE THAT THE PUBLIC

00:13:23.369 --> 00:13:24.837
UTILITIES COMMISSION -- IS BY

00:13:24.904 --> 00:13:26.205
THE CONSTITUTION THE ECONOMIC

00:13:26.272 --> 00:13:28.374
REGULATOR FOR THE I. O. U.'S AND

00:13:28.440 --> 00:13:29.275
SO IF YOU WERE TO HAVE A

00:13:29.341 --> 00:13:30.376
SEPARATE BOARD.

00:13:30.442 --> 00:13:31.477
YOU WOULD WANT TO MAKE SURE

00:13:31.544 --> 00:13:33.212
WHATEVER DECISIONS THAT THEY'VE

00:13:33.279 --> 00:13:35.514
PASSED OUR OUR BINDING --

00:13:35.581 --> 00:13:37.283
IMPROPERLY FLOW THROUGH THE P.

00:13:37.349 --> 00:13:40.419
YOU SEE BUT I WOULD SAY THAT IS

00:13:40.486 --> 00:13:41.320
A CHALLENGE.

00:13:41.387 --> 00:13:42.354
ANOTHER ISSUE THAT I REASON OUR

00:13:42.421 --> 00:13:43.756
DISCUSSION WAS AT THE P. YOU SEE

00:13:43.822 --> 00:13:46.192
DOES OVERALL SAFETY OVERSIGHT

00:13:46.258 --> 00:13:47.393
FOR THE INVESTOR OWNED UTILITIES

00:13:47.459 --> 00:13:48.394
AND THERE AR SEVERAL OTHER

00:13:48.460 --> 00:13:50.396
PROCESSES IN PLACE ARE RELATED

00:13:50.462 --> 00:13:51.130
TO WILDFIRES.

00:13:51.197 --> 00:13:52.665
SEED ONE ALL OF THESE TO BE

00:13:52.731 --> 00:13:55.401
COORDINATED AND HARMONIZED THIS

00:13:55.467 --> 00:13:57.536
INCLUDES THE ONE ONE NEW NEW

00:13:57.603 --> 00:14:01.207
BOARD END OF HOW WOULD THE NEW

00:14:01.273 --> 00:14:02.975
BOARD -- YOU KNOW THERE'S

00:14:03.042 --> 00:14:04.376
STREAMLINING.

00:14:04.443 --> 00:14:05.811
PROCESS SEASON AND PROCEDURAL

00:14:05.878 --> 00:14:07.379
DESIGNATIONS IN THIS THE

00:14:07.446 --> 00:14:08.581
GOVERNOR SHRIKE FORCE THEY WERE

00:14:08.647 --> 00:14:10.015
TALKING ABOUT THE STREAMLINING

00:14:10.082 --> 00:14:12.084
EFFORT -- DO YOU SEE THAT THIS

00:14:12.151 --> 00:14:13.385
COULD.

00:14:13.452 --> 00:14:14.787
OF THE CREATION THE NEW NEW

00:14:14.853 --> 00:14:16.388
BOARD COULD ACCOMPLISH THAT OR

00:14:16.455 --> 00:14:18.157
IS IT JUST MERELY TRANSFERRING

00:14:18.224 --> 00:14:19.925
THOSE SAME IMBEDDED PROBLEMS AT

00:14:19.992 --> 00:14:22.328
THE CPUC HAS TO THE NEW BOARD

00:14:22.394 --> 00:14:24.029
THAT -- AND THE NEW STRUCTURE IT

00:14:24.096 --> 00:14:26.098
IS A BEEN ANY DISCUSSION AS TO

00:14:26.165 --> 00:14:27.266
HOW THAT WOULD.

00:14:27.333 --> 00:14:29.435
WOULD BE IMPLEMENTED A COULD BE.

00:14:29.501 --> 00:14:34.340
IT WAS NOT -- IN EFFECT THE

00:14:34.406 --> 00:14:36.875
RESEARCHER THANK YOU -- ONE OF

00:14:36.942 --> 00:14:38.544
THE COST RECOVERY OPTIONS

00:14:38.611 --> 00:14:40.312
PRESENTED IN THE IN THE WELL IN

00:14:40.379 --> 00:14:41.981
YOU'VE MENTIONED IT -- WAS THE

00:14:42.047 --> 00:14:45.351
CHANGE -- FROM THE PRUDENCE THE

00:14:45.417 --> 00:14:46.418
PRESUMPTION OF PRUDENCE RATHER

00:14:46.485 --> 00:14:47.886
THAN THE PRESUMPTION OF

00:14:47.953 --> 00:14:49.188
IMPRUDENCE.

00:14:49.255 --> 00:14:51.190
OF MORE ALIGNED TO THE FOR MODEL

00:14:51.257 --> 00:14:53.659
OF DOING THAT -- IN YOU

00:14:53.726 --> 00:14:55.027
MENTIONED THAT THAT IS THE CASE

00:14:55.094 --> 00:14:56.562
CAN YOU CAN YOU EXPLAIN A LITTLE

00:14:56.629 --> 00:14:58.397
BIT OF THE HISTORY BEHIND THE C.

00:14:58.464 --> 00:15:00.266
P. UC'S PRESUMPTION.

00:15:00.332 --> 00:15:02.735
OF PRUDENCE AND HOW THAT CAME

00:15:02.801 --> 00:15:05.037
ABOUT AND AND WHAT YOU CAN DIG

00:15:05.104 --> 00:15:06.071
DOWN A LITTLE BIT INTO THAT

00:15:06.138 --> 00:15:09.775
WHOLE ISSUE OF OF DETERMINE

00:15:09.842 --> 00:15:11.143
LIABILITY AND PRUDENCE.

00:15:11.210 --> 00:15:14.313
SURE SO THE THE WAY IN WHICH

00:15:14.380 --> 00:15:15.781
THAT THE P. YOU SEE CURRENTLY

00:15:15.848 --> 00:15:16.815
DOES.

00:15:16.882 --> 00:15:18.284
PREVIOUSLY REQUIRES THAT THE

00:15:18.350 --> 00:15:19.451
UTILITIES PROVE BEYOND

00:15:19.518 --> 00:15:20.886
PROPONENTS OF EVIDENCE THAT

00:15:20.953 --> 00:15:22.888
COSTS ARE JUST AND REASONABLE.

00:15:22.955 --> 00:15:25.157
AND THAT IS THE STANDARD A

00:15:25.224 --> 00:15:26.992
METHOD THAT'S USED ACROSS ALMOST

00:15:27.059 --> 00:15:28.627
ALL PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION

00:15:28.694 --> 00:15:30.963
AND ACROSS OTHER MATTERS THAT

00:15:31.030 --> 00:15:32.631
ARE DEALT WITH IN THE P. YOU SEE --

00:15:32.698 --> 00:15:33.999
THERE HASN'T BEEN MUCH

00:15:34.066 --> 00:15:36.602
EXPERIENCE WITH LITIGATING COSTS

00:15:36.669 --> 00:15:38.003
RELATED TO CATASTROPHIC

00:15:38.070 --> 00:15:39.838
WILDFIRES HAS ONLY BEEN ONE

00:15:39.905 --> 00:15:42.174
PARTICULAR CASE BEFORE THE PC.

00:15:42.241 --> 00:15:44.209
THE PC DECIDED NOT TO PASS ALONG

00:15:44.276 --> 00:15:46.378
THOSE COST OF THOUGH -- THAT

00:15:46.445 --> 00:15:47.346
SHOULD NOT BE A SOON TO BE

00:15:47.413 --> 00:15:50.382
PRESIDENT FOR OUR FUTURE CASES.

00:15:50.449 --> 00:15:51.016
I THINK ONE OF THE THINGS THAT

00:15:51.083 --> 00:15:52.084
WE HEARD WHICH IS A CHALLENGES

00:15:52.151 --> 00:15:54.086
THAT.

00:15:54.153 --> 00:15:56.422
THIS IS IN RELATIVELY NEW AREA

00:15:56.488 --> 00:15:57.156
FOR THINKING ABOUT WHAT IS

00:15:57.222 --> 00:15:58.557
PRUDENT.

00:15:58.624 --> 00:15:59.925
AND SO DETERMINING WHAT PRUDENT

00:15:59.992 --> 00:16:01.927
BEHAVIOR IS CAN BE CHALLENGING

00:16:01.994 --> 00:16:02.494
AND OVER TIME IT SHOULD BE

00:16:02.561 --> 00:16:04.563
EASIER AS WE HAVE THINGS LIKE

00:16:04.630 --> 00:16:05.864
THE WILD FIRE MITIGATION PLANS

00:16:05.931 --> 00:16:07.499
ACTIVE.

00:16:07.566 --> 00:16:09.101
AND MORE COLLECTIVE EXPERIENCE.

00:16:09.168 --> 00:16:10.969
BUT GIVEN THAT THE LIMóN

00:16:11.036 --> 00:16:12.571
EXPERIENCE WE HAVE.

00:16:12.638 --> 00:16:14.006
ENDED I THINK SIGNIFICANT

00:16:14.073 --> 00:16:16.375
CONCERN FROM INVESTORS THAT IT'S

00:16:16.442 --> 00:16:18.110
NOT CLEAR UP FRONT WHAT THE

00:16:18.177 --> 00:16:19.578
UTILITY SHOULD BE DOING.

00:16:19.645 --> 00:16:21.280
WE TRIED TO THINK ABOUT WHAT

00:16:21.347 --> 00:16:23.048
WOULD BE A REASONABLE STEP AT

00:16:23.115 --> 00:16:25.351
THIS TIME -- IN TERMS OF

00:16:25.417 --> 00:16:26.251
RECONCILING SOME OF THOSE

00:16:26.318 --> 00:16:28.387
CONCERNS IN NOT WANTING TO WE

00:16:28.454 --> 00:16:29.955
ACTUALLY RECOMMEND AGAINST

00:16:30.022 --> 00:16:32.291
HAVING A PRESET STAY AT A PRE

00:16:32.358 --> 00:16:33.992
SET LIST.

00:16:34.059 --> 00:16:34.493
OF ACTIVITIES THAT ARE

00:16:34.560 --> 00:16:35.828
CONSIDERED PRUDENT BECAUSE WE

00:16:35.894 --> 00:16:37.730
THINK IT'S TOO MUCH SHORT TOO

00:16:37.796 --> 00:16:39.631
PREMATURE TO DO THAT -- BUT WE

00:16:39.698 --> 00:16:40.933
DO THINK.

00:16:40.999 --> 00:16:42.401
THAT IS NOT UNREASONABLE TO DO

00:16:42.468 --> 00:16:44.670
IT FOR DOES WHICH IS ASSUME THAT

00:16:44.737 --> 00:16:46.171
THE UTILITIES HAVE BEEN PRUDENT.

00:16:46.238 --> 00:16:47.639
AND THEN COLLECT EVIDENCE TO THE

00:16:47.706 --> 00:16:49.475
CONTRARY THIS IS NOT MEAN THE

00:16:49.541 --> 00:16:51.744
UTILITY DOESN'T HAVE TO MAKE ITS

00:16:51.810 --> 00:16:54.346
CASE THEY DO -- BUT IT DOES

00:16:54.413 --> 00:16:55.647
SHIFT THE BURDEN -- I

00:16:55.714 --> 00:16:56.915
ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THIS IS A

00:16:56.982 --> 00:16:59.318
DEVIATION FROM CURRENT PRACTICE

00:16:59.385 --> 00:17:01.687
AND SO I THINK TO BE SUCCESSFUL

00:17:01.754 --> 00:17:03.956
IT'S IMPORTANT TO MAKE SURE THAT

00:17:04.022 --> 00:17:06.191
INTERVENOR IS THE OFFICER SAFETY

00:17:06.258 --> 00:17:08.827
ENFORCEMENT HAVE THE RESOURCES

00:17:08.894 --> 00:17:10.095
TO DO THEIR OWN ANALYSIS THEIR

00:17:10.162 --> 00:17:11.697
OWN MODELING AND THAT THEY GET

00:17:11.764 --> 00:17:13.332
SUFFICIENT DATA.

00:17:13.399 --> 00:17:15.033
DISCOVERY FROM THE UTILITIES THE

00:17:15.100 --> 00:17:16.235
AND THAT WAS MY FIRST GOING TO

00:17:16.301 --> 00:17:16.935
BE MY FINAL QUESTION HOW WOULD

00:17:17.002 --> 00:17:17.970
THEY GET.

00:17:18.036 --> 00:17:19.304
IF WE CHANGE THAT STANDARD HOW

00:17:19.371 --> 00:17:20.672
WOULD THEN THE INTERVENOR

00:17:20.739 --> 00:17:21.974
WHOEVER'S INVOLVED IN TRYING TO

00:17:22.040 --> 00:17:23.409
DETERMINE THAT PRUDENCE OR

00:17:23.475 --> 00:17:24.443
IMPROVING STANDARD.

00:17:24.510 --> 00:17:26.145
HOW WOULD THEY GET THE DATA THE

00:17:26.211 --> 00:17:27.212
INFORMATION AND -- IT'S

00:17:27.279 --> 00:17:29.915
NECESSARY TO BUILD A CASE IF

00:17:29.982 --> 00:17:31.350
NECESSARY AND SO I THINK IT

00:17:31.417 --> 00:17:33.218
WOULD BE THE SAME WAY THAT THEY

00:17:33.285 --> 00:17:34.820
CURRENTLY GET THAT INFORMATION --

00:17:34.887 --> 00:17:37.990
IF THEY'RE ALLOWED TO GET ACCESS

00:17:38.056 --> 00:17:38.891
THROUGH.

00:17:38.957 --> 00:17:39.892
THEY TO DISCOVERY THERE WOULD BE

00:17:39.958 --> 00:17:41.326
A ACTIVE PROCEEDING -- I THINK

00:17:41.393 --> 00:17:42.895
THIS IS REALLY GETTING INTO SOME

00:17:42.961 --> 00:17:43.796
FINER POINTS OF THE WEEDS BY

00:17:43.862 --> 00:17:45.864
PROCESS WHERE YOU NEED TO GO IS

00:17:45.931 --> 00:17:47.599
MAKING SURE THAT PARTIES HAVE

00:17:47.666 --> 00:17:48.567
ACCESS TO INTERVIEW --

00:17:48.634 --> 00:17:51.003
COMPENSATION TO HIRE CONSULTANTS

00:17:51.069 --> 00:17:53.172
AN ANALYST TO DO A SUPPORT THIS

00:17:53.238 --> 00:17:54.072
WORK.

00:17:54.139 --> 00:17:55.774
AND I WILL SAY THIS IS NOT ME IN

00:17:55.841 --> 00:17:56.775
THE EYE YOU TO THE P. YOU SEE

00:17:56.842 --> 00:17:57.876
ULTIMATELY MAINTAINS ITS

00:17:57.943 --> 00:18:00.813
DISCRETION IN THIS CASE -- AND

00:18:00.879 --> 00:18:03.148
WE'LL WAIT THE EVIDENCE -- BUT

00:18:03.215 --> 00:18:04.683
IT DOES PROVIDE SOME SHIFTED THE

00:18:04.750 --> 00:18:06.218
BURDEN WITHOUT ASSUMING

00:18:06.285 --> 00:18:08.153
AUTOMATIC COST RECOVERY.

00:18:08.220 --> 00:18:09.955
THANK YOU THANK YOU.

00:18:10.022 --> 00:18:11.290
THANK YOU.

00:18:11.356 --> 00:18:13.525
CENTER MORE LIKE.

00:18:13.592 --> 00:18:15.561
MISTER CHAIR THANK YOU MISS

00:18:15.627 --> 00:18:16.862
PETERMAN JUST A FEW QUICK

00:18:16.929 --> 00:18:18.997
QUESTIONS THE FIRST THIS IS MORE

00:18:19.064 --> 00:18:21.567
OF A DETAIL ORIENTED -- AS YOU

00:18:21.633 --> 00:18:23.035
LOOK INTO UTILITY.

00:18:23.101 --> 00:18:26.338
ACTIVITY THERE'S A ARE A RULE.

00:18:26.405 --> 00:18:27.773
TWENTY EIGHT AND B. AND ALLOWS

00:18:27.840 --> 00:18:29.975
FOR CREDITS AND BE ABLE TO USE

00:18:30.042 --> 00:18:31.343
THOSE THOSE FUNDS FOR

00:18:31.410 --> 00:18:32.578
BEAUTIFICATION TO PERHAPS

00:18:32.644 --> 00:18:33.912
UNDERGROUND.

00:18:33.979 --> 00:18:37.216
CERTAIN A UTILITY LINES WHAT WAS

00:18:37.282 --> 00:18:37.883
THAT REVIEWED BY YOUR COMMITTEE.

00:18:37.950 --> 00:18:38.884
IT WAS NOT.

00:18:38.951 --> 00:18:43.055
A MODELS -- WE HAVE YOU KNOW IN

00:18:43.121 --> 00:18:45.324
CALIFORNIA SOME I USE THAT HAVE

00:18:45.390 --> 00:18:47.659
DONE WELL ON BEEN PROACTIVE AND

00:18:47.726 --> 00:18:49.027
WE'VE GOT ONE THAT'S CREATED

00:18:49.094 --> 00:18:50.896
PLENTY OF I MEDIA.

00:18:50.963 --> 00:18:52.231
ATTENTION.

00:18:52.297 --> 00:18:53.599
AND WE HAVE OTHER STATES THAT

00:18:53.665 --> 00:18:54.666
ALSO HAVE.

00:18:54.733 --> 00:18:56.502
FIRE RISKS SO DO WE LOOK AT

00:18:56.568 --> 00:18:59.705
MODELS OF HERE'S HOW DID UTILITY

00:18:59.771 --> 00:19:00.572
SHOULD RUN HERE'S HOW IT'S DONE

00:19:00.639 --> 00:19:01.240
IN.

00:19:01.306 --> 00:19:03.342
A STATE THAT HASN'T HAD THE

00:19:03.408 --> 00:19:05.611
PROBLEMS REVIEWS WE'VE AT SO

00:19:05.677 --> 00:19:07.479
MAKE A COUPLE OBSERVATIONS ALONG

00:19:07.546 --> 00:19:09.848
THOSE LINES -- AS A PART OF FROM

00:19:09.915 --> 00:19:11.049
WHAT I UNDERSTAND THE WILD FIRE

00:19:11.116 --> 00:19:12.518
MITIGATION PLAN PROCEEDING AT

00:19:12.584 --> 00:19:13.652
THE P. YOU SEE.

00:19:13.719 --> 00:19:15.120
THEY DID TAKE INFORMATION AND

00:19:15.187 --> 00:19:17.356
REVIEW WHAT ARE SOME OF THE BEST

00:19:17.422 --> 00:19:20.359
PRACTICES IN THIS AREA -- AND SO

00:19:20.425 --> 00:19:22.427
THERE'S SOME EXAMPLES OUT THERE.

00:19:22.494 --> 00:19:24.329
OTHER STATES HAVE NOT HAD FIRES

00:19:24.396 --> 00:19:26.632
OF THIS SIZE NOR DO THEY HAVE

00:19:26.698 --> 00:19:28.534
THE AMOUNT FRANKLY OF LAND AND

00:19:28.600 --> 00:19:31.336
PROPERTY VALUE IN HARM'S WAY AND

00:19:31.403 --> 00:19:33.238
SO THEY HAVE NOT HAD BECAUSE THE

00:19:33.305 --> 00:19:33.805
SAME LEVEL OF DAMAGE TO DEAL

00:19:33.872 --> 00:19:34.740
WITH.

00:19:34.806 --> 00:19:36.308
WE DID GET A PRESENTATION FROM

00:19:36.375 --> 00:19:37.342
THE P. YOU SEE IN OUR FIRST

00:19:37.409 --> 00:19:38.844
MEETING THAT TALKED ABOUT SOME

00:19:38.911 --> 00:19:40.612
OF THE GEOGRAPHIC DIFFERENCES

00:19:40.679 --> 00:19:42.648
BETWEEN THE UTILITIES WHICH WILL

00:19:42.714 --> 00:19:44.149
MAKE SURE TO PROVIDE.

00:19:44.216 --> 00:19:45.851
TO YOUR COMMITTEE BUT ONE THING

00:19:45.918 --> 00:19:47.486
THAT IS STRIKING IS THE SIZE OF

00:19:47.553 --> 00:19:48.420
THE TERRITORIES THAT WE'RE

00:19:48.487 --> 00:19:50.222
TALKING ABOUT AND HOW MUCH OF

00:19:50.289 --> 00:19:53.825
THAT TERRITORY IS IN A HI

00:19:53.892 --> 00:19:55.227
WILDFIRE RISK AREA.

00:19:55.294 --> 00:19:56.261
P. JEANNIE AND WE'LL JUST PUT

00:19:56.328 --> 00:19:57.529
MANAGEMENT QUESTIONS AND ISSUES

00:19:57.596 --> 00:19:59.831
ASIDE HAS A TERRITORY THAT IS

00:19:59.898 --> 00:20:00.866
MORE AT RISK.

00:20:00.933 --> 00:20:02.334
P. JEANNIE ALSO HAS A LOWER

00:20:02.401 --> 00:20:03.835
PERCENTAGE OF UNDER GROUNDING

00:20:03.902 --> 00:20:04.970
AND THAT'S ACTUALLY A RESULT OF

00:20:05.037 --> 00:20:06.505
LAW IN ONE OF THINGS THAT WE

00:20:06.572 --> 00:20:08.440
HAVE LEARNED ABOUT WAS THERE'S A

00:20:08.507 --> 00:20:09.908
LAW ON THE SIXTIES.

00:20:09.975 --> 00:20:11.143
THAT MEANT THAT NEW COULD

00:20:11.209 --> 00:20:12.411
RESIDENTIAL COMMUNITIES HAD

00:20:12.477 --> 00:20:14.279
UNDER GROUNDING WIRES AND SO SAN

00:20:14.346 --> 00:20:16.114
DIEGO DEVELOP LATER AND HAS A

00:20:16.181 --> 00:20:17.883
GREATER PERCENTAGE OF WIRES

00:20:17.950 --> 00:20:18.317
UNDERGROUND.

00:20:18.383 --> 00:20:20.452
STILL P. GENIE IS STARTING AT A

00:20:20.519 --> 00:20:22.387
DIFFERENT PLACE -- AND SO IT'S

00:20:22.454 --> 00:20:23.555
IMPORTANT TO TAKE LESSONS FROM

00:20:23.622 --> 00:20:24.890
THE OTHER UTILITIES BUT ALSO

00:20:24.957 --> 00:20:26.258
THINK ABOUTJUST PRACTICALLY

00:20:26.325 --> 00:20:28.560
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN ON THE

00:20:28.627 --> 00:20:29.861
GROUND -- FOR EACH OF THEM.

00:20:29.928 --> 00:20:30.462
THE LAST QUESTION AND I DON'T

00:20:30.529 --> 00:20:32.230
KNOW HOW.

00:20:32.297 --> 00:20:33.398
TO KEEP IT SHORT BUT WE'VE UP

00:20:33.465 --> 00:20:34.766
WITH A PAINTING HERE.

00:20:34.833 --> 00:20:35.934
AND AND I NEED TO MOVE

00:20:36.001 --> 00:20:38.303
ELECTRICITY FROM ONE SIDE TO THE

00:20:38.370 --> 00:20:38.804
OTHER.

00:20:38.870 --> 00:20:40.005
SO I NEED.

00:20:40.072 --> 00:20:40.572
TO TALK TO THE OWNER THEIR

00:20:40.639 --> 00:20:42.207
PROPERTY WHETHER IT'S FEDERAL

00:20:42.274 --> 00:20:43.141
STATE OR PRIVATE.

00:20:43.208 --> 00:20:44.910
SAY I NEED TO MOVE THIS BUT

00:20:44.977 --> 00:20:46.578
CRITICS HAVE CUSTOMERS AND I I

00:20:46.645 --> 00:20:47.312
NEED TO DO IT.

00:20:47.379 --> 00:20:49.948
SO STARTING JUST FROM SCRATCH

00:20:50.015 --> 00:20:50.983
LIKE THE LIKE WE'RE JUST

00:20:51.049 --> 00:20:52.384
STARTING WITH A CLEAN SLATE.

00:20:52.451 --> 00:20:53.785
HOW WOULD I NEGOTIATE WITH THE

00:20:53.852 --> 00:20:55.320
UTILITIES SAY HEY I YOU CAN GO

00:20:55.387 --> 00:20:55.887
AHEAD AND COME THROUGH MY

00:20:55.954 --> 00:20:56.788
PROPERTY?

00:20:56.855 --> 00:20:57.923
BUT HERE THE THINGS YOU NEED TO

00:20:57.990 --> 00:20:59.524
DO TO MAKE SURE THAT MY PROPERTY

00:20:59.591 --> 00:21:00.292
IS NOT.

00:21:00.359 --> 00:21:03.161
ENDANGERED OR AT RISK AND WHAT

00:21:03.228 --> 00:21:05.163
KIND OF POLICIES AND PROCEDURES

00:21:05.230 --> 00:21:07.532
WHAT I PUT IN PLACE.

00:21:07.599 --> 00:21:09.001
THAT'S THE BIG QUESTION WHICH I

00:21:09.067 --> 00:21:10.235
DON'T HAVE A GREAT ANSWER FOR IT

00:21:10.302 --> 00:21:12.638
BUT I'LL SAY.

00:21:12.704 --> 00:21:14.306
THERE ARE RULES AND SUCH IN

00:21:14.373 --> 00:21:16.041
PLACE REGARDING WHAT ACCESS TO

00:21:16.108 --> 00:21:17.743
THE RIGHT AWAY MEANS AND WHAT

00:21:17.809 --> 00:21:19.378
MAINTENANCE HAS TO BE DONE --

00:21:19.444 --> 00:21:20.245
THERE SEVERAL GENERAL ORDERS

00:21:20.312 --> 00:21:22.047
RELATED TO THAT SO I WOULD GO

00:21:22.114 --> 00:21:23.348
BACK AND LOOK AND AT THE

00:21:23.415 --> 00:21:24.883
EXISTING ORDERS AND SAY ARE THEY

00:21:24.950 --> 00:21:27.119
SUFFICIENT ENOUGH -- I WILL SAY

00:21:27.185 --> 00:21:28.487
THAT THERE HAVE BEEN UPDATES TO

00:21:28.553 --> 00:21:29.921
THE RULES AROUND VEGETATION

00:21:29.988 --> 00:21:31.890
MANAGEMENT -- OVER THE LAST

00:21:31.957 --> 00:21:33.625
COUPLE YEARS AS RESPONSE TO THE

00:21:33.692 --> 00:21:36.194
FIRES AND SO -- ONE QUESTION

00:21:36.261 --> 00:21:37.896
WILL BE DO THEY GO FAR ENOUGH --

00:21:37.963 --> 00:21:39.631
BUT FROM WHAT I UNDERSTAND WE

00:21:39.698 --> 00:21:41.199
HAVE SOME OF THE MOST AGGRESSIVE

00:21:41.266 --> 00:21:43.001
RULES IN PLACE FOR PROTECTION OF

00:21:43.068 --> 00:21:44.269
THE RIGHT AWAY.

00:21:44.336 --> 00:21:46.238
THANK YOU THANK YOU MISTER SIR

00:21:46.304 --> 00:21:47.139
JACKSON.

00:21:47.205 --> 00:21:48.740
THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH

00:21:48.807 --> 00:21:50.876
AND I SHARE THE H. --

00:21:50.942 --> 00:21:52.944
APPRECIATION OF MEMBERS OF THIS

00:21:53.011 --> 00:21:54.579
COMMITTEE KNOWING YOUR LONG

00:21:54.646 --> 00:21:58.016
STANDING WORK IN IN THIS AREA

00:21:58.083 --> 00:22:00.585
AND OTHERS AND YOUR INTELLECT

00:22:00.652 --> 00:22:02.120
AND AN ABILITY.

00:22:02.187 --> 00:22:04.222
TO SORT OF CULL THROUGH LAW TO

00:22:04.289 --> 00:22:07.559
DIFFICULT SCENARIOS -- IN

00:22:07.626 --> 00:22:11.296
PREPARING THIS REPORT -- I'M

00:22:11.363 --> 00:22:13.098
WONDERING WHAT WAS YOUR NUMBER

00:22:13.165 --> 00:22:14.966
ONE PRIORITY.

00:22:15.033 --> 00:22:16.568
WHAT WAS YOUR NUMBER ONE FOCUS

00:22:16.635 --> 00:22:20.272
IN THIS EFFORT?

00:22:20.338 --> 00:22:22.274
SO I WOULD SAY AT LARGE IT WAS

00:22:22.340 --> 00:22:23.842
RECOMMENDING A SERIES OF

00:22:23.909 --> 00:22:24.976
RECOMMENDATIONS THAT CAN PUT

00:22:25.043 --> 00:22:27.713
CALIFORNIA ON THE RIGHT PATH.

00:22:27.779 --> 00:22:30.982
AND BY RIGHT PATH I MEAN A

00:22:31.049 --> 00:22:32.451
WILDFIRE.

00:22:32.517 --> 00:22:33.452
RISKS.

00:22:33.518 --> 00:22:35.687
SITUATION A UTILITY HEALTH

00:22:35.754 --> 00:22:37.389
SITUATION.

00:22:37.456 --> 00:22:39.024
THAT MADE WILD FIRE VICTIMS

00:22:39.091 --> 00:22:40.992
BETTER OFF THAT MAKE CUSTOMERS

00:22:41.059 --> 00:22:42.828
WHO LIVE IN THE WILDLY INTERVENE

00:22:42.894 --> 00:22:44.129
INTERFACE BETTER OFF.

00:22:44.196 --> 00:22:45.831
AND THAT MAKE ELECTRIC CUSTOMERS

00:22:45.897 --> 00:22:47.632
BETTER OFF [inaudible]

00:22:47.699 --> 00:22:49.501
SO.

00:22:49.568 --> 00:22:51.770
I SIT HERE IN IN MY NUMBER ONE

00:22:51.837 --> 00:22:54.372
CONCERN -- AS SOMEONE WHO IS

00:22:54.439 --> 00:22:56.408
BEEN THROUGH A NUMBER OF THESE

00:22:56.475 --> 00:22:57.309
EVENTS.

00:22:57.375 --> 00:22:58.844
BASED UPON WHERE I LIVE BASED

00:22:58.910 --> 00:22:59.711
UPON.

00:22:59.778 --> 00:23:01.780
THE INTENSITY OF CLIMATE CHANGE

00:23:01.847 --> 00:23:04.583
AND BASED UPON HAVING JUST HAD.

00:23:04.649 --> 00:23:05.751
ONE OF THE MAJOR FIRES IN

00:23:05.817 --> 00:23:07.652
CALIFORNIA HISTORY.

00:23:07.719 --> 00:23:10.956
MY CONCERN IS PUBLIC SAFETY.

00:23:11.022 --> 00:23:13.391
AND OF PROTECTING LIFE AND

00:23:13.458 --> 00:23:15.160
PROPERTY.

00:23:15.227 --> 00:23:18.530
SO WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT -- THE

00:23:18.597 --> 00:23:22.868
CONCERN OF CHANGING THE BURDEN.

00:23:22.934 --> 00:23:26.505
OF FROM A STRICT LIABILITY -- TO

00:23:26.571 --> 00:23:29.441
A FAULT BASED SYSTEM.

00:23:29.508 --> 00:23:30.742
THE FIRST THING THAT COMES TO MY

00:23:30.809 --> 00:23:32.477
MIND IS THAT WE'VE HAD A STRICT

00:23:32.544 --> 00:23:34.746
LIABILITY SYSTEM.

00:23:34.813 --> 00:23:37.816
AND YET THOSE COMPANIES WHO.

00:23:37.883 --> 00:23:39.851
RECOGNIZE THAT THEY ARE GOING TO

00:23:39.918 --> 00:23:41.553
BE LIABLE IF THEIR EQUIPMENT

00:23:41.620 --> 00:23:45.490
CAUSES OF FIRE -- HAVEN'T TAKEN

00:23:45.557 --> 00:23:47.492
THAT RESPONSIBILITY PARTICULARLY

00:23:47.559 --> 00:23:49.261
SERIOUSLY.

00:23:49.327 --> 00:23:50.862
IF WE THEN REDUCE THAT

00:23:50.929 --> 00:23:53.165
REQUIREMENT TO A FALSE A FULL TO

00:23:53.231 --> 00:23:55.600
BASED STANDARD HOW IS IT THAT

00:23:55.667 --> 00:23:56.868
WE'RE GOING TO FIND THOSE

00:23:56.935 --> 00:23:58.069
COMPANIES.

00:23:58.136 --> 00:23:59.404
TAKING THEIR RESPONSIBILITY

00:23:59.471 --> 00:24:02.474
SERIOUSLY WHEN THEY NO LONGER

00:24:02.541 --> 00:24:04.209
ARE GOING TO BE HELD LAW OR

00:24:04.276 --> 00:24:06.645
LIKELY TO BE HELD A 100%.

00:24:06.711 --> 00:24:07.779
LIABLE.

00:24:07.846 --> 00:24:09.314
SO IT COULD YOU COULD YOU

00:24:09.381 --> 00:24:10.482
EXPLAIN THE THINKING ON THAT

00:24:10.549 --> 00:24:12.751
BECAUSE IF THEY'RE NOT WILLING

00:24:12.818 --> 00:24:14.286
TO DO WHAT THEY SHOULD DO TO

00:24:14.352 --> 00:24:16.154
PROTECT AGAINST CEASE FIRES NOW

00:24:16.221 --> 00:24:18.123
WITH A WITH ESSENTIALLY AN

00:24:18.190 --> 00:24:20.025
ABSOLUTE LIABILITY HOW DO YOU

00:24:20.091 --> 00:24:20.759
THINK.

00:24:20.826 --> 00:24:22.694
OF THAT THEY'RE GOING TO TAKE

00:24:22.761 --> 00:24:24.262
THAT RESPONSIBILITY SERIOUSLY

00:24:24.329 --> 00:24:26.565
WHEN THEIR LIABILITY IS ACTUALLY

00:24:26.631 --> 00:24:29.100
REDUCED.

00:24:29.167 --> 00:24:31.069
SO I THINK THAT THE MOTIVATION

00:24:31.136 --> 00:24:33.572
FOR TAKING A FIRE SERIOUSLY IS

00:24:33.638 --> 00:24:34.406
FIRST OF ALL.

00:24:34.472 --> 00:24:35.974
IT JUST STARTING TO UNDERSTAND

00:24:36.041 --> 00:24:38.310
THE LIKELIHOOD IN PREVALENCE OF

00:24:38.376 --> 00:24:39.678
THESE FIRES REALLY UNDERSTANDING

00:24:39.744 --> 00:24:41.213
THE WILD FIRE RISK.

00:24:41.279 --> 00:24:42.914
AND THEN ALSO IDENTIFYING WATER

00:24:42.981 --> 00:24:44.149
WAYS IN WHICH TO MITIGATE THAT

00:24:44.216 --> 00:24:46.017
RISK AND THOSE ARE BOTH THINGS

00:24:46.084 --> 00:24:46.818
THAT I THINK WE'VE ALL

00:24:46.885 --> 00:24:48.386
COLLECTIVELY COME TO A BETTER

00:24:48.453 --> 00:24:50.755
UNDERSTANDING OF IN THE LAST.

00:24:50.822 --> 00:24:52.624
TWELVE TO TWENTY FOUR MONTHS.

00:24:52.691 --> 00:24:55.660
AND SO WE DID NOT GET TESTIMONY

00:24:55.727 --> 00:24:59.831
FROM THE UTILITIES AND THAT THE

00:24:59.898 --> 00:25:01.233
PRESENCE OF THAT STRICT

00:25:01.299 --> 00:25:03.068
LIABILITY STANDARD WAS THE

00:25:03.134 --> 00:25:05.203
MOTIVATING FACTOR IN TERMS OF

00:25:05.270 --> 00:25:07.339
THEM REDUCING WILD FIRE RISK.

00:25:07.405 --> 00:25:08.340
SO I THINK THE WAY THAT WE GET

00:25:08.406 --> 00:25:10.609
THAT ACTION IS TO MAKE SURE THAT

00:25:10.675 --> 00:25:12.911
WE YOU REQUIRE MEDICATION THAT

00:25:12.978 --> 00:25:15.280
WE INVEST IN MITIGATION.

00:25:15.347 --> 00:25:17.682
AND THAT'S ONE OF THE REASONS.

00:25:17.749 --> 00:25:19.718
WHY I CAME TO THE PLACE OF

00:25:19.784 --> 00:25:21.386
UNDERSTANDING AND BELIEVING THAT

00:25:21.453 --> 00:25:22.454
WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT OUR

00:25:22.520 --> 00:25:24.089
UTILITIES?

00:25:24.155 --> 00:25:25.257
BUT PEOPLE WANT INVEST IN OUR

00:25:25.323 --> 00:25:27.292
UTILITIES BECAUSE WE NEED THAT

00:25:27.359 --> 00:25:28.760
INVESTMENT IN ORDER TO FUND THIS

00:25:28.827 --> 00:25:29.728
MEDICATION THAT WE'RE TALKING

00:25:29.794 --> 00:25:31.196
ABOUT.

00:25:31.263 --> 00:25:32.130
I THINK ONCE YOU START SETTING

00:25:32.197 --> 00:25:33.565
THE STANDARDS IN PLACE AND YOU

00:25:33.632 --> 00:25:35.467
PUT IN A PLACE. TO HAVE THE

00:25:35.533 --> 00:25:37.135
STANDARDS INVOLVED THEN YOU MAKE

00:25:37.202 --> 00:25:38.870
SURE THAT IF UTILITY MANAGEMENT

00:25:38.937 --> 00:25:40.639
DOES NOT ACT PRUDENTLY THAT

00:25:40.705 --> 00:25:42.374
THERE ARE FINES AND PENALTIES.

00:25:42.440 --> 00:25:43.708
I THINK AGAIN OVER THE NEXT FEW

00:25:43.775 --> 00:25:44.509
YEARS OUR COLLECTIVE

00:25:44.576 --> 00:25:46.077
UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT IS PRUDENT

00:25:46.144 --> 00:25:47.946
MANAGE IT WHAT IT WHAT IS BEING

00:25:48.013 --> 00:25:49.581
A PRINT MANAGER WILL BECOME MORE

00:25:49.648 --> 00:25:50.782
CLEAR.

00:25:50.849 --> 00:25:54.185
AND THEN IT'LL BE EASIER. TO THE

00:25:54.252 --> 00:25:56.121
WHOLE THE UTILITIES ACCOUNTABLE.

00:25:56.187 --> 00:25:57.856
WHEN THEY'RE AT FAULT

00:25:57.923 --> 00:25:58.156
[inaudible]

00:25:58.223 --> 00:25:59.224
SO.

00:25:59.291 --> 00:26:00.558
YOU SAY THAT OUR COLLECTIVE

00:26:00.625 --> 00:26:02.427
UNDERSTANDING OF PRUDENT

00:26:02.494 --> 00:26:04.229
MANAGEMENT WILL BECOME CLEAR WHO

00:26:04.296 --> 00:26:06.298
IS GOING TO MAKE THIS CLEAR ARE

00:26:06.364 --> 00:26:07.065
WE GOING TO LOOK TO THE P. YOU

00:26:07.132 --> 00:26:08.366
SEE.

00:26:08.433 --> 00:26:10.435
BECAUSE THE P. YOU SEE -- HS

00:26:10.502 --> 00:26:12.203
ACKNOWLEDGE I THINK A ONE OF OUR

00:26:12.270 --> 00:26:13.338
HEARINGS THAT THEY DON'T HAVE

00:26:13.405 --> 00:26:15.340
THE CAPACITY THEY'RE NOT EXPERTS

00:26:15.407 --> 00:26:16.441
IN THIS FIELD.

00:26:16.508 --> 00:26:18.176
SO WHERE ARE YOU GOING TO BE

00:26:18.243 --> 00:26:22.347
LOOKING -- TO GET ASSURANCES AT

00:26:22.414 --> 00:26:23.615
SO THAT THE PUBLIC HAS

00:26:23.682 --> 00:26:25.583
CONFIDENCE THAT THERE THAT THERE

00:26:25.650 --> 00:26:29.587
IS PRUDENT MANAGEMENT OF OUR

00:26:29.654 --> 00:26:31.356
ELECTRICAL SYSTEMS SO THAT WE

00:26:31.423 --> 00:26:33.458
ARE WHEN WHEN SOMEONE COMES AND

00:26:33.525 --> 00:26:35.727
SAYS -- I'M NOT SURE I WANT TO

00:26:35.794 --> 00:26:37.762
LET YOU PUT AN EASEMENT ACROSS

00:26:37.829 --> 00:26:38.897
MY LAND.

00:26:38.964 --> 00:26:40.165
NOW WE HAVE TO DO THAT AND

00:26:40.231 --> 00:26:42.334
THAT'S WHEN THE REASONS WE HAVE

00:26:42.400 --> 00:26:43.268
INVERSE CONDEMNATION.

00:26:43.335 --> 00:26:45.437
RIGHT BECAUSE YOU ARE TAKING

00:26:45.503 --> 00:26:47.439
AWAY SOMEONE'S ENJOYMENT OF

00:26:47.505 --> 00:26:49.874
THEIR PROPERTY -- IN ORDER FOR A

00:26:49.941 --> 00:26:52.043
GREATER GOOD THEORETICALLY AND

00:26:52.110 --> 00:26:53.478
IF SOMETHING HAPPENS THAT

00:26:53.545 --> 00:26:55.347
IMPAIRS THAT ENJOYMENT THE I AEA

00:26:55.413 --> 00:26:56.881
FIRE.

00:26:56.948 --> 00:26:58.883
THAT THAT COMPANY OR WHOEVER IT

00:26:58.950 --> 00:27:00.852
IS NEEDS TO TAKE RESPONSIBILITY

00:27:00.919 --> 00:27:02.087
FOR IT SO.

00:27:02.153 --> 00:27:04.155
HOW WE GONNA GET TO THAT PLACE --

00:27:04.222 --> 00:27:05.423
WHO'S GOING TO BE THE ONE TO

00:27:05.490 --> 00:27:06.758
DECIDE WHAT PRUDENT MANAGEMENT

00:27:06.825 --> 00:27:09.227
IS.

00:27:09.294 --> 00:27:10.862
OUR RECOMMENDATION IS STILL TO

00:27:10.929 --> 00:27:12.697
MAINTAIN THAT FUNCTION AT THE

00:27:12.764 --> 00:27:15.200
PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION.

00:27:15.266 --> 00:27:16.167
AS YOU NOTED THE PUBLIC

00:27:16.234 --> 00:27:17.302
UTILITIES COMMISSION MAY HAVE

00:27:17.369 --> 00:27:18.670
TOLD YOU THAT THEY DON'T HAVE

00:27:18.737 --> 00:27:20.171
THAT EXPERTISE AND THEY DON'T

00:27:20.238 --> 00:27:21.940
HAVE THE EXPERTISE THE WAY THAT

00:27:22.007 --> 00:27:24.376
HAVE THE EXPERTISE SURROUNDS --

00:27:24.442 --> 00:27:25.744
OTHER INVESTMENTS I CAN GAS FOR

00:27:25.810 --> 00:27:27.045
EXAMPLE BUT I THINK THE

00:27:27.112 --> 00:27:29.481
CHALLENGES THERE'S THE EXPERTISE

00:27:29.547 --> 00:27:31.282
ISN'T WIDELY OUT THERE PERIOD

00:27:31.349 --> 00:27:32.450
RIGHT BECAUSE WE'RE TAKING

00:27:32.517 --> 00:27:33.084
ABOUT A COMBINATION OF THINGS

00:27:33.151 --> 00:27:35.620
IT'S WHAT DOES IT MEAN TO SAFELY

00:27:35.687 --> 00:27:37.389
OPERATE ONE INDIVIDUAL PIECE OF

00:27:37.455 --> 00:27:38.523
EQUIPMENT.

00:27:38.590 --> 00:27:39.624
WHICH THERE IS A LOT OF

00:27:39.691 --> 00:27:41.926
EXPERIENCE ON AND THEN WHAT IS

00:27:41.993 --> 00:27:43.061
IT MEAN TO OPERATE THAT

00:27:43.128 --> 00:27:44.329
EQUIPMENT SAFELY GIVEN THE

00:27:44.396 --> 00:27:46.097
POSSIBILITY THAT IT MIGHT IGNITE

00:27:46.164 --> 00:27:47.665
A FIRE WHICH MAY LEAD TO A

00:27:47.732 --> 00:27:49.167
SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF HUMAN AND

00:27:49.234 --> 00:27:50.402
ECONOMIC DAMAGE.

00:27:50.468 --> 00:27:52.137
WHICH IS HARD TO FIGURE OUT HOW

00:27:52.203 --> 00:27:53.805
MUCH THAT WILL BE AND SO THERE'S

00:27:53.872 --> 00:27:55.673
A SEVERAL THINGS THAT HAPPEN

00:27:55.740 --> 00:27:57.642
BETWEEN AT MISSION AND WHEN WE

00:27:57.709 --> 00:27:58.676
GET TO THE POINT WHERE WE HAVE

00:27:58.743 --> 00:28:00.378
WILD FIRE VICTIMS AND I THINK

00:28:00.445 --> 00:28:01.646
WHAT ARE REPORTING KNOWLEDGES.

00:28:01.713 --> 00:28:02.647
IS THAT THERE ARE SEVERAL

00:28:02.714 --> 00:28:04.816
DIFFERENT STAKEHOLDERS THAT HAVE

00:28:04.883 --> 00:28:06.451
SOME ROLE IN THAT PROCESS AND

00:28:06.518 --> 00:28:07.318
THEREFORE WE THINK THAT THE

00:28:07.385 --> 00:28:09.020
RESPONSIBILITY FOR MEDICATION

00:28:09.087 --> 00:28:10.588
INVESTMENT AND RECOVERY OF COSTS

00:28:10.655 --> 00:28:12.257
SHOULD SPREAD ACROSS ALL THOSE

00:28:12.323 --> 00:28:14.659
DIFFERENT STAKEHOLDERS -- I'LL

00:28:14.726 --> 00:28:15.794
JUST SAY ALSO IT'S MY

00:28:15.860 --> 00:28:16.861
UNDERSTANDING TO THAT THE P. YOU

00:28:16.928 --> 00:28:18.263
SEE IS DEVELOPING ITS CAPACITY

00:28:18.329 --> 00:28:20.432
MORE -- BUT THAT'S WHY WE SAID

00:28:20.498 --> 00:28:23.635
IF THERE IS A NOTHER ENTITY THAT

00:28:23.701 --> 00:28:25.203
THE STATE FEELS MORE COMFORTABLE

00:28:25.270 --> 00:28:25.804
WITH CONCENTRATING THAT

00:28:25.870 --> 00:28:27.906
KNOWLEDGE IN THAT IS SOMETHING

00:28:27.972 --> 00:28:29.274
WORTH PURSUING AS WELL WHEN I

00:28:29.340 --> 00:28:30.175
TALK TO EXPERTS OUT THERE

00:28:30.241 --> 00:28:31.242
EVERYONE'S TRYING TO FIGURE THIS

00:28:31.309 --> 00:28:32.844
OUT AT THE SAME TIME INSURANCE

00:28:32.911 --> 00:28:34.446
COMPANIES UTILITIES THE

00:28:34.512 --> 00:28:35.113
REGULATORS.

00:28:35.180 --> 00:28:36.815
ABOUT WHAT IS A REASONABLE

00:28:36.881 --> 00:28:39.084
MITIGATION -- AND HAD OF THOSE

00:28:39.150 --> 00:28:41.419
COSTS COMPARE WITH OTHER COST

00:28:41.486 --> 00:28:44.422
THAT WE WANT INVESTMENT YOU WANT

00:28:44.489 --> 00:28:45.924
THE TILDE THREE MAKING.

00:28:45.990 --> 00:28:47.225
SO IF I MET ONE LAST QUESTION.

00:28:47.292 --> 00:28:50.228
SO -- WE LOOK NOW OUR I THINK

00:28:50.295 --> 00:28:52.197
MANY OF US LOOK NOW TO THE WORK

00:28:52.263 --> 00:28:53.765
THAT'S BEEN DONE BY SAN DIEGO

00:28:53.832 --> 00:28:56.101
GAS ELECTRIC IS A RESULT OF THE

00:28:56.167 --> 00:28:58.103
PC HOLDING THEM RESPONSIBLE IF

00:28:58.169 --> 00:29:00.371
YOU WELL WITHOUT THE ABILITY.

00:29:00.438 --> 00:29:02.507
TO GET REIMBURSED AND I GUESS

00:29:02.574 --> 00:29:04.676
IT'S UNDER JUDICIAL REVIEW BUT

00:29:04.742 --> 00:29:06.311
AT THAT POINT IN TIME I THINK

00:29:06.377 --> 00:29:07.879
WAS.

00:29:07.946 --> 00:29:08.746
TWO THOUSAND SEVEN THEY WENT OUT

00:29:08.813 --> 00:29:12.851
TO A AND CREATED A SYSTEM THAT

00:29:12.917 --> 00:29:17.689
HAS USED THE THE BEST PRACTICES

00:29:17.755 --> 00:29:19.724
THEY CREATED USING TECHNOLOGY IS

00:29:19.791 --> 00:29:22.727
SYSTEM WHICH NOW HAS HAD I THINK

00:29:22.794 --> 00:29:25.396
A SIGNIFICANT -- A POSITIVE

00:29:25.463 --> 00:29:27.632
IMPACT ON MITIGATING THOSE

00:29:27.699 --> 00:29:30.368
POTENTIAL WILDFIRES.

00:29:30.435 --> 00:29:34.005
SO WHEN YOU -- CONSIDER.

00:29:34.072 --> 00:29:37.041
THAT THIS HAS BEEN DONE THAT

00:29:37.108 --> 00:29:38.610
THERE HAS BEEN SUFFICIENT

00:29:38.676 --> 00:29:40.044
MOTIVATION.

00:29:40.111 --> 00:29:41.679
AND IT WAS A COST BASED

00:29:41.746 --> 00:29:43.448
MOTIVATION IF YOU WILL FROM THE

00:29:43.515 --> 00:29:45.583
FIRE I THINK IN TWO THOUSAND AND

00:29:45.650 --> 00:29:47.285
THREE OR TWO THOUSAND AND SEVEN

00:29:47.352 --> 00:29:48.520
IN THAT AREA.

00:29:48.586 --> 00:29:50.955
WE WE HAVE SEEN AN EXAMPLE WHEN

00:29:51.022 --> 00:29:52.757
A COMPANY YOU UNDERSTAND SO IT'S

00:29:52.824 --> 00:29:55.593
BASICALLY THEY'RE ON THE HOOK.

00:29:55.660 --> 00:29:57.328
TO GO OUT INTO DO THESE THINGS

00:29:57.395 --> 00:29:58.863
THAT YOU GET A WE'RE TALKING

00:29:58.930 --> 00:30:00.665
ABOUT BEING DONE THEN YOU HAVE A

00:30:00.732 --> 00:30:02.000
COMPANY LIKE P. JEANNIE.

00:30:02.066 --> 00:30:04.469
THAT HAS SEEN ITSELF MORE I

00:30:04.536 --> 00:30:06.971
WOULD SAY AS A PRIVATE ENTITY

00:30:07.038 --> 00:30:09.407
GIVING BONUSES TO ITSELF AND AND

00:30:09.474 --> 00:30:10.975
DOING THINGS THAT HAVE REALLY

00:30:11.042 --> 00:30:13.244
NOT BEEN NECESSARILY IN THE BEST

00:30:13.311 --> 00:30:14.846
INTEREST OF THE PUBLIC.

00:30:14.913 --> 00:30:16.214
HOW DO YOU?

00:30:16.281 --> 00:30:18.249
IF YOU KNOW HOW DO YOU BALANCE

00:30:18.316 --> 00:30:22.053
THOSE TWO HOW DO YOU JUSTIFY.

00:30:22.120 --> 00:30:24.856
REDUCING A LIABILITY COMPONENT.

00:30:24.923 --> 00:30:27.025
WHERE YOU SEE ONE ONE COMPANY

00:30:27.091 --> 00:30:28.860
TOOK IT PRETTY SERIOUSLY?

00:30:28.927 --> 00:30:29.928
AND WITH THE STATE OF THE ART

00:30:29.994 --> 00:30:31.996
PROGRAM AND ANOTHER THE KEEPS

00:30:32.063 --> 00:30:33.798
INSISTING UPON GIVING BONUSES TO

00:30:33.865 --> 00:30:35.466
ITSELF AND TO ITS PEOPLE AND

00:30:35.533 --> 00:30:36.668
THEN RUNNING INTO THE BANKRUPTCY

00:30:36.734 --> 00:30:38.303
COURT WE SAW THIS TWENTY YEARS

00:30:38.369 --> 00:30:40.872
AGO -- WHEN THEY DON'T LIKE?

00:30:40.939 --> 00:30:43.808
THE LIABILITIES THAT THEY'VE.

00:30:43.875 --> 00:30:45.143
CREATED FOR THEMSELVES SO.

00:30:45.210 --> 00:30:47.078
HOW HOW DO WE EXPLAIN THIS TO

00:30:47.145 --> 00:30:48.580
THE PUBLIC HOW DO WE AND AND

00:30:48.646 --> 00:30:49.681
MOST IMPORTANTLY HOW DO WE

00:30:49.747 --> 00:30:51.716
PROTECT AGAINST THESE KINDS OF

00:30:51.783 --> 00:30:54.319
FIRES -- GIVEN CHOICES THAT ARE

00:30:54.385 --> 00:30:56.321
BEING MADE BY ONE COMPANY OVER

00:30:56.387 --> 00:31:00.158
ANOTHER. ONE ONE OF OUR

00:31:00.225 --> 00:31:01.125
RECOMMENDATIONS.

00:31:01.192 --> 00:31:03.061
RELATES TO WILDFIRE FIND AND

00:31:03.127 --> 00:31:05.063
WHAT WE ARE VERY EXPLICIT ABOUT

00:31:05.129 --> 00:31:07.398
IS HOW MUCH A UTILITY SHOULD

00:31:07.465 --> 00:31:09.133
CONTRIBUTE TO THAT FUN SHOULD BE

00:31:09.200 --> 00:31:11.269
TIED TO THEIR ACTUARIAL RISK.

00:31:11.336 --> 00:31:13.004
SO AND THAT COULD BE A FUNCTION

00:31:13.071 --> 00:31:15.607
OF BOTH THEIR WILDFIRE GEOGRAPHY

00:31:15.673 --> 00:31:17.342
RISK AS WELL AS THEIR PAST

00:31:17.408 --> 00:31:19.010
EXPERIENCE OF WILDFIRES SO IN

00:31:19.077 --> 00:31:21.179
THAT SITUATION YOU EXPECTED

00:31:21.246 --> 00:31:23.314
UTILITY LIKE P. JEANNIE. TO GROW

00:31:23.381 --> 00:31:25.216
TO BEAR A GREATER SHARE OF THE

00:31:25.283 --> 00:31:27.118
COST -- SANDY -- GAS AND

00:31:27.185 --> 00:31:29.254
ELECTRIC HAS DEMONSTRATED NOW

00:31:29.320 --> 00:31:31.456
WORLD CLASS TECHNOLOGY WITH WILD

00:31:31.522 --> 00:31:34.792
FIRE DETECTION AND PREVENTION.

00:31:34.859 --> 00:31:36.561
I WILL SAY THAT THEY MADE THOSE

00:31:36.628 --> 00:31:38.229
INVESTMENTS YEARS BEFORE THE P.

00:31:38.296 --> 00:31:40.398
YOU SEE DECIDED ON WHETHER THEY

00:31:40.465 --> 00:31:42.000
COULD RECOVER THOSE COSTS THE P.

00:31:42.066 --> 00:31:44.702
YOU SEATED INSIDE ON THAT.

00:31:44.769 --> 00:31:45.303
TWENTY SEVENTEEN AND WHAT WE

00:31:45.370 --> 00:31:45.770
HEARD FROM AT THE G.

00:31:45.837 --> 00:31:48.206
REPRESENTATIVES IN OUR FORUM WAS.

00:31:48.273 --> 00:31:49.841
THEY JUST SAID YOU NEVER AGAIN

00:31:49.907 --> 00:31:51.075
WE DON'T WANT TO FIRE THAT BAD

00:31:51.142 --> 00:31:52.777
IN OUR TERRITORY EVER AGAIN SO

00:31:52.844 --> 00:31:55.913
WE'RE GOING TO DO WHAT IT TAKES --

00:31:55.980 --> 00:31:57.515
THE WHAT WE HEARD WAS NOT THAT

00:31:57.582 --> 00:31:58.650
IT WAS A DIRECT RESPONSE TO

00:31:58.716 --> 00:31:59.951
STRICT LIABILITY ALTHOUGH OF

00:32:00.018 --> 00:32:02.020
COURSE THAT CAN BE A FACTOR AND

00:32:02.086 --> 00:32:04.255
SO. ONE OF THE THINGS I THINK WE

00:32:04.322 --> 00:32:06.224
NEED TO BE SENSITIVE TO TO A SAN

00:32:06.291 --> 00:32:07.759
DIEGO HAS DONE IS THEY'VE BEEN

00:32:07.825 --> 00:32:08.593
ABLE TO USE CAMERAS AND

00:32:08.660 --> 00:32:09.994
TECHNOLOGIES TO FIGURE OUT WHEN

00:32:10.061 --> 00:32:11.462
THE SHUT OFF THE POWER.

00:32:11.529 --> 00:32:12.864
BUT NOT NECESSARILY HOW TO

00:32:12.930 --> 00:32:14.866
QUICKLY STOP A FIRE SO THERE ARE

00:32:14.932 --> 00:32:16.334
THESE OTHER CIRCUMSTANCES.

00:32:16.401 --> 00:32:18.436
WHICH CONTRIBUTE TO A FIRE

00:32:18.503 --> 00:32:20.004
DAMAGE BUT I DO THINK THOSE ARE

00:32:20.071 --> 00:32:21.406
ALL TECHNOLOGIES AND INVESTMENTS

00:32:21.472 --> 00:32:24.442
THAT ARE UTILITIES NEED TO BE

00:32:24.509 --> 00:32:24.942
DOING.

00:32:25.009 --> 00:32:25.476
BUT I KNOW THAT IT'S NOT

00:32:25.543 --> 00:32:26.244
SOMETHING THAT THE PUBLIC

00:32:26.311 --> 00:32:27.612
UTILITIES COMMISSION ORDERED TO

00:32:27.679 --> 00:32:28.946
THE OTHER UTILITIES TO DO OR THE

00:32:29.013 --> 00:32:30.982
LEGISLATURE DID AS WELL AND SO I

00:32:31.049 --> 00:32:32.650
THINK WE ARE NOW IN A PLACE.

00:32:32.717 --> 00:32:33.384
WHERE WE REALLY LOOK AT THIS

00:32:33.451 --> 00:32:35.086
CLOSELY AND SAID OKAY HERE THE

00:32:35.153 --> 00:32:37.055
TYPES OF THINGS WE WANT TO SEE?

00:32:37.121 --> 00:32:38.189
BUT THEY DO CONTRIBUTE TO COST

00:32:38.256 --> 00:32:39.490
SAN DIEGO HAS THE HIGHEST

00:32:39.557 --> 00:32:40.858
ELECTRIC RATES OF ALL THE

00:32:40.925 --> 00:32:43.261
INVESTOR OWNED UTILITIES AND SO

00:32:43.328 --> 00:32:43.895
ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE WERE

00:32:43.961 --> 00:32:45.830
STRUCK BY IN THE TESTIMONY WE

00:32:45.897 --> 00:32:46.664
GOT.

00:32:46.731 --> 00:32:47.699
WAS HOW ELECTRIC RATES ARE GOING

00:32:47.765 --> 00:32:49.701
UP IN PARTICULAR HOW ELECTRIC

00:32:49.767 --> 00:32:50.902
CUSTOMERS ARE PAYING FOR WHILE

00:32:50.968 --> 00:32:52.370
FIRE MITIGATION IN ADDITION TO

00:32:52.437 --> 00:32:53.304
DAMAGE.

00:32:53.371 --> 00:32:54.672
AS WE DO THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO

00:32:54.739 --> 00:32:56.607
BE SENSITIVE TO THAT IMPACT

00:32:56.674 --> 00:32:57.942
WHICH IS WHY WE RECOMMEND MORE

00:32:58.009 --> 00:33:02.347
BROADLY SOCIALIZING THE COST.

00:33:02.413 --> 00:33:03.648
THANK CENTER CENTER HERTZBERG.

00:33:03.715 --> 00:33:05.850
THE MISMATCH CHAIRMAN THANK YOU

00:33:05.917 --> 00:33:07.218
VERY MUCH FOR SETTING.

00:33:07.285 --> 00:33:08.252
THIS HEARING TODAY ON YOUR

00:33:08.319 --> 00:33:09.654
BIRTHDAY YOUR GREAT COMMITMENT

00:33:09.721 --> 00:33:11.456
TO PUBLIC SERVICES DEMONSTRATED

00:33:11.522 --> 00:33:12.256
HERE.

00:33:12.323 --> 00:33:14.125
BIRTHDAY AND I ALSO WANT TO SAY

00:33:14.192 --> 00:33:15.993
THAT DESPITE THE REFERENCES

00:33:16.060 --> 00:33:18.429
THERE WILL BE NO EASEMENTS AT

00:33:18.496 --> 00:33:21.432
THE ASSEMBLY.

00:33:21.499 --> 00:33:23.868
I DON'T THINK THAT'S HAPPENING.

00:33:23.935 --> 00:33:25.870
THERE JACKSON TALKED ABOUT BOND

00:33:25.937 --> 00:33:27.438
HOW TO EXPLAIN THIS TO THE

00:33:27.505 --> 00:33:29.107
PUBLIC.

00:33:29.173 --> 00:33:31.175
YOU TALKED ABOUT ON A SERIES OF

00:33:31.242 --> 00:33:34.512
RECOMMENDATIONS THAT WE CAN PUT --

00:33:34.579 --> 00:33:36.748
PUT US ON THE RIGHT PATH -- I

00:33:36.814 --> 00:33:37.982
THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA ARE

00:33:38.049 --> 00:33:40.485
WATCHING AND I WOULD SAY THAT.

00:33:40.551 --> 00:33:42.153
IN IN THE OTHER POINT YOU MADE

00:33:42.220 --> 00:33:43.488
THAT PEOPLE WANT TO INVEST IN

00:33:43.554 --> 00:33:45.056
OUR UTILITIES.

00:33:45.123 --> 00:33:46.124
I LOOK AT YOUR FIRST

00:33:46.190 --> 00:33:48.059
RECOMMENDATION THE CORE WITHOUT

00:33:48.126 --> 00:33:49.260
JUDGMENT AND SAY IT'S

00:33:49.327 --> 00:33:50.995
CONSTITUTIONAL QUESTION.

00:33:51.062 --> 00:33:52.930
SO HERE WE ARE WERE DELIVERED BY

00:33:52.997 --> 00:33:54.699
THE RATING AGENCIES A DOCUMENT

00:33:54.766 --> 00:33:56.067
THAT SAYS.

00:33:56.134 --> 00:33:57.969
THAT UNLESS LEGISLATION PASSES

00:33:58.035 --> 00:33:59.470
THAT REDUCES THE CREDIT RISK TO

00:33:59.537 --> 00:34:01.105
CALIFORNIA LOOK TO TELL THESE

00:34:01.172 --> 00:34:02.740
ARE CURRENT EXPECTATIONS YOU TO

00:34:02.807 --> 00:34:04.809
DOWNGRADE UTILITIES AT AROUND

00:34:04.876 --> 00:34:06.310
JULY TWELFTH.

00:34:06.377 --> 00:34:07.879
WE'RE GOING TO FACE A DOWNGRADE

00:34:07.945 --> 00:34:09.414
WE FURTHER HAVE ONE OF OUR

00:34:09.480 --> 00:34:10.515
INVESTOR OWNED UTILITIES IN

00:34:10.581 --> 00:34:12.250
BANKRUPTCY ANYBODY WHO'S EVER

00:34:12.316 --> 00:34:13.217
BEEN A LAWYER DEALING WITH

00:34:13.284 --> 00:34:14.485
BANKRUPTCY COURTS MISSILE CASKEY

00:34:14.552 --> 00:34:15.420
KNOW.

00:34:15.486 --> 00:34:17.755
THAT IT TAKES A LONG TIME TO GET

00:34:17.822 --> 00:34:18.723
ANY RESOLUTION.

00:34:18.790 --> 00:34:20.258
SO IF WE'RE GOING TO TAKE YOUR

00:34:20.324 --> 00:34:21.759
COURSE OF ACTION WE'RE GONNA DAN

00:34:21.826 --> 00:34:23.628
PASSED BY TWO THIRDS VOTES OF

00:34:23.694 --> 00:34:25.263
BOTH HOUSES OF THE LEGISLATURE

00:34:25.329 --> 00:34:26.364
SOMETHING TO PUT ON THE BALLOT

00:34:26.431 --> 00:34:27.498
FOR NOTE THE ASTEST WAY

00:34:27.565 --> 00:34:29.667
POSSIBLE MARCH OF TWO THOUSAND

00:34:29.734 --> 00:34:32.103
AND TWENTY RIGHT.

00:34:32.170 --> 00:34:34.405
N. WERE FACED AT THE SAME TIME

00:34:34.472 --> 00:34:37.008
WITH THIS ISSUE OF THE INVESTOR

00:34:37.074 --> 00:34:39.110
OWNED UTILITY IN IN IN IN IN THE

00:34:39.177 --> 00:34:41.145
NORTH HAVING ITS CHALLENGES THE

00:34:41.212 --> 00:34:42.413
RATING AGENCIES SAYING WHAT

00:34:42.480 --> 00:34:43.514
THEY'RE SAYING.

00:34:43.581 --> 00:34:45.349
HOW IS THAT FROM MY PERSPECTIVE

00:34:45.416 --> 00:34:48.152
AT LEAST GOT INFORMED BY THE THE

00:34:48.219 --> 00:34:50.087
ADVICE YOU GAVE OF PUTTING US ON

00:34:50.154 --> 00:34:51.956
THE RIGHT PATH BOTH INSPIRING

00:34:52.023 --> 00:34:53.458
INVESTMENT IN THE UTILITIES?

00:34:53.524 --> 00:34:54.892
AND MAKING SURE THAT WE DON'T

00:34:54.959 --> 00:34:56.093
HAVE THIS PROBLEM HOW DO WE

00:34:56.160 --> 00:34:58.529
REACH THAT BALANCE I'M TRYING TO

00:34:58.596 --> 00:35:00.531
LISTEN TO THE RECOMMENDATIONS IN

00:35:00.598 --> 00:35:02.633
EARNEST LISTENING TO WHAT THE

00:35:02.700 --> 00:35:04.635
GOVERNOR DID IN EARNEST ABOUT

00:35:04.702 --> 00:35:05.503
BUT WE CERTAINLY KNOW WE'RE IN A

00:35:05.570 --> 00:35:06.871
TOUGH SITUATION.

00:35:06.938 --> 00:35:07.972
BUT THE QUESTION IS DO THESE

00:35:08.039 --> 00:35:09.841
RECOMMENDATIONS REALLY PUT US ON

00:35:09.907 --> 00:35:11.909
A PATH TO TO TO CHEAT THE

00:35:11.976 --> 00:35:13.177
DELIVERABLES THAT YOU TALK ABOUT

00:35:13.244 --> 00:35:14.745
PARTICULARLY.

00:35:14.812 --> 00:35:15.313
IN THE EVENT WE HAVE ANOTHER

00:35:15.379 --> 00:35:16.214
WILDFIRE.

00:35:16.280 --> 00:35:19.250
IN A VASE MERE -- IN IN THE NEAR

00:35:19.317 --> 00:35:21.452
TERM.

00:35:21.519 --> 00:35:23.554
SO I WOULD.

00:35:23.621 --> 00:35:25.356
READ ALL THESE RECOMMENDATIONS.

00:35:25.423 --> 00:35:27.758
AS A COMPLETE SET.

00:35:27.825 --> 00:35:29.594
I THINK ONE NEEDS TO BE CAREFUL

00:35:29.660 --> 00:35:30.862
ABOUT.

00:35:30.928 --> 00:35:32.897
PARSING OUT ANYONE ALONE BECAUSE

00:35:32.964 --> 00:35:33.731
I DON'T THINK THERE'S ONE

00:35:33.798 --> 00:35:34.699
RECOMMENDATION ALONE THAT GETS

00:35:34.765 --> 00:35:36.501
YOU.

00:35:36.567 --> 00:35:38.603
A SOLUTION AND SO.

00:35:38.669 --> 00:35:39.837
ALWAYS MENTION THE FIRST ONE

00:35:39.904 --> 00:35:42.073
FIRST BECAUSE THAT'S HOW WE

00:35:42.139 --> 00:35:43.374
FIRST DEALT WITH IT MAY MEASURE

00:35:43.441 --> 00:35:45.510
MENTION IT LAST -- BUT YOU KNOW

00:35:45.576 --> 00:35:47.144
JUST BEGIN TAKING A STEP BACK

00:35:47.211 --> 00:35:48.513
ABOUT.

00:35:48.579 --> 00:35:50.381
AT A HIGH LEVEL YOU KNOW HOW I

00:35:50.448 --> 00:35:51.916
THINK THROUGH THESE

00:35:51.983 --> 00:35:53.317
RECOMMENDATIONS.

00:35:53.384 --> 00:35:54.051
YEAH WE WERE ASKED TO LOOK AT

00:35:54.118 --> 00:35:55.520
HOW DO WE ASK WHO ACTUALLY

00:35:55.586 --> 00:35:57.455
ALLOCATE COST.

00:35:57.522 --> 00:35:59.991
AND THE INTERPRETATION OF THE

00:36:00.057 --> 00:36:02.460
STRICT LIABILITY -- THE STRICT

00:36:02.527 --> 00:36:04.428
LIABILITY INTERPRETATION OF THE

00:36:04.495 --> 00:36:05.796
INVERSE CONDEMNATION DOCTRINE

00:36:05.863 --> 00:36:09.000
MEANS THAT THESE COST FALL TO

00:36:09.066 --> 00:36:11.602
UTILITY SHAREHOLDERS AND REPAIRS.

00:36:11.669 --> 00:36:13.504
AND OTHER STATES THEY FALL TO A

00:36:13.571 --> 00:36:15.306
BROADER SET OF INDIVIDUALS

00:36:15.373 --> 00:36:15.606
[inaudible]

00:36:15.673 --> 00:36:17.308
SO.

00:36:17.375 --> 00:36:18.843
THAT IS ONE WAY TO THINK ABOUT

00:36:18.910 --> 00:36:21.746
SOCIALIZING COSTS MORE BROADLY

00:36:21.812 --> 00:36:22.146
IS THE CHANGE THAT

00:36:22.213 --> 00:36:23.414
INTERPRETATION.

00:36:23.481 --> 00:36:24.916
IF THAT INTERPRETATION IS NOT

00:36:24.982 --> 00:36:26.384
CHANGED THEN WE ARE IN A

00:36:26.450 --> 00:36:27.818
SITUATION WHERE THESE COSTS FALL

00:36:27.885 --> 00:36:30.054
TO SHAREHOLDERS AND RATE PAYERS

00:36:30.121 --> 00:36:31.789
AND INVESTORS ARE SAYING WE

00:36:31.856 --> 00:36:33.558
THINK IT'S A VERY RISKY

00:36:33.624 --> 00:36:35.359
INVESTMENT FOR US TO INVEST IN

00:36:35.426 --> 00:36:36.360
UTILITIES WHERE THERE'S AN

00:36:36.427 --> 00:36:38.229
UNCAPPED THE LIABILITY FOR

00:36:38.296 --> 00:36:39.964
SHAREHOLDERS.

00:36:40.031 --> 00:36:41.299
WE'RE GOING TO ASK THAT ALL

00:36:41.365 --> 00:36:42.967
THOSE COSTS AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE

00:36:43.034 --> 00:36:47.838
FALL TWO ELECTRIC CUSTOMERS.

00:36:47.905 --> 00:36:49.674
LEAD TO IS THAT FAIR GIVEN THAT

00:36:49.740 --> 00:36:50.942
THESE ELECTRIC CUSTOMERS.

00:36:51.008 --> 00:36:52.777
ARE JUST A DIFFERENT NAME FOR

00:36:52.843 --> 00:36:54.946
CALIFORNIANS BUT IT'S ALL ABOUT

00:36:55.012 --> 00:36:56.647
KIND OF HOW MUCH ELECTRICITY USE.

00:36:56.714 --> 00:36:58.416
WE GOT LOTS OF EVIDENCE THAT

00:36:58.482 --> 00:36:59.784
ELECTRIC CUSTOMER KOSTER

00:36:59.850 --> 00:37:01.252
INCREASING AND WE'RE ASKING

00:37:01.319 --> 00:37:03.020
ELECTRIC CUSTOMERS TO INVEST IN

00:37:03.087 --> 00:37:04.221
THE MITIGATION.

00:37:04.288 --> 00:37:05.856
AND PAY FOR THE DAMAGE.

00:37:05.923 --> 00:37:07.525
AND SO THAT LED TO THE

00:37:07.592 --> 00:37:10.394
RECOMMENDATION OF A FUND -- WITH

00:37:10.461 --> 00:37:11.596
ONE MORE THING.

00:37:11.662 --> 00:37:13.431
WHEN WE LOOK AT COST RECOVERY WE

00:37:13.497 --> 00:37:14.966
HAD TO ADDRESS THIS QUESTION

00:37:15.032 --> 00:37:16.767
ABOUT HOW DO YOU MAKE IT?

00:37:16.834 --> 00:37:17.935
MORE REASONABLE TO INVEST IN

00:37:18.002 --> 00:37:19.136
CALIFORNIA TILL THESE BECAUSE WE

00:37:19.203 --> 00:37:20.137
LOOK AT WHY PEOPLE INVESTING

00:37:20.204 --> 00:37:22.406
UTILITIES THERE'S A CAP UPSIDE

00:37:22.473 --> 00:37:24.642
TO INVESTING IN UTILITY YOU KNOW

00:37:24.709 --> 00:37:26.377
THAT WE SET THE RATE OF RETURN.

00:37:26.444 --> 00:37:27.478
THEY'RE CONSIDERED HISTORICALLY

00:37:27.545 --> 00:37:29.480
PRETTY SAFE INVESTMENTS AND ALL

00:37:29.547 --> 00:37:30.715
THE THINGS THAT ARE HAPPENING OR

00:37:30.781 --> 00:37:32.016
MAKING THEM MORE RISKY

00:37:32.083 --> 00:37:33.551
INVESTMENTS AND THAT'S GOING TO

00:37:33.618 --> 00:37:35.219
COST MORE ULTIMATELY. FOR

00:37:35.286 --> 00:37:37.088
RATEPAYERS IN TERMS OF WHAT THE

00:37:37.154 --> 00:37:38.022
UTILITIES HAVE TO BORROW.

00:37:38.089 --> 00:37:39.523
SO THEN WE GET TO THE QUESTION

00:37:39.590 --> 00:37:40.992
OF IF YOU CAN'T HAVE ALL THE LET

00:37:41.058 --> 00:37:42.293
YOUR CUSTOMERS PAY FOR THESE

00:37:42.360 --> 00:37:44.629
LIABILITIES THAT ARE TEN ELEVEN

00:37:44.695 --> 00:37:46.564
TIMES WITH THE INSURANCE CAN

00:37:46.631 --> 00:37:47.832
COVER.

00:37:47.898 --> 00:37:48.599
THEN HOW DO WE MORE BROADLY

00:37:48.666 --> 00:37:49.600
SOCIALIZING WHICH IS WHY HE

00:37:49.667 --> 00:37:51.068
RECOMMENDED A FUN WHICH TAKES US

00:37:51.135 --> 00:37:55.406
BACK TO SOCIALIZING ACROSS

00:37:55.473 --> 00:37:56.941
PROPERTY OWNERS.

00:37:57.008 --> 00:37:58.376
THE EASIEST MIGHT BE TO

00:37:58.442 --> 00:38:00.344
SOCIALIZE ACOSTA TAXPAYERS WHICH

00:38:00.411 --> 00:38:02.079
ALMOST GET YOU BACK FULL CIRCLE

00:38:02.146 --> 00:38:03.180
TO WHAT A CHANGE TO THE INVERSE

00:38:03.247 --> 00:38:04.515
CONDEMNATION DOCTRINE WOULD DO

00:38:04.582 --> 00:38:06.050
AND SO THAT'S HOW THESE THINGS

00:38:06.117 --> 00:38:08.152
ALL IN A RELAY IT REALLY GETS TO

00:38:08.219 --> 00:38:09.587
WE'VE GOT LIABILITIES.

00:38:09.654 --> 00:38:10.888
BEYOND WHAT WE COULD IMAGINE

00:38:10.955 --> 00:38:12.289
IT'S OUR BIGGEST RECOMMENDATION

00:38:12.356 --> 00:38:14.158
WHICH I JUST TO START WITH IS

00:38:14.225 --> 00:38:15.393
REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF WILD FIRE

00:38:15.459 --> 00:38:17.395
RISK WHAT WE KNOW IS THAT

00:38:17.461 --> 00:38:18.429
THERE'S MORE FINANCIAL

00:38:18.496 --> 00:38:19.897
MECHANISMS AVAILABLE TO US

00:38:19.964 --> 00:38:20.898
THEY'LL BE MORE INSURANCE

00:38:20.965 --> 00:38:22.033
AVAILABLE MORE THINGS LIKE

00:38:22.099 --> 00:38:23.968
CATASTROPHIC BONDS THE SMALLER

00:38:24.035 --> 00:38:25.102
THE RISK.

00:38:25.169 --> 00:38:26.637
AND WE ARE TAKING THE STEPS NINE

00:38:26.704 --> 00:38:27.204
A ONE IS TAKING US IN THAT

00:38:27.271 --> 00:38:28.806
DIRECTION BUT WE KNOW THAT WILL

00:38:28.873 --> 00:38:30.808
TAKE SOME TIME AND SO I THINK

00:38:30.875 --> 00:38:31.442
THE CHALLENGE FOR OUR COMMISSION

00:38:31.509 --> 00:38:33.110
WAS.

00:38:33.177 --> 00:38:34.512
WE WE REALLY NEED PROTECTION IS

00:38:34.578 --> 00:38:36.180
IN THESE NEXT FEW YEARS.

00:38:36.247 --> 00:38:37.248
AND THE THINGS THAT GIVE US

00:38:37.314 --> 00:38:38.783
THEIR GIVE US THAT BUFFER GIVE

00:38:38.849 --> 00:38:40.251
US THAT BACKSTOP ARE HARD TO DO.

00:38:40.317 --> 00:38:41.318
SO WE HAVE TRIED TO MAKE

00:38:41.385 --> 00:38:43.154
RECOMMENDATIONS THAT ACKNOWLEDGE

00:38:43.220 --> 00:38:45.189
THAT THIS COULD BE A TEMPORARY

00:38:45.256 --> 00:38:46.724
ISSUE MAYBE THIS YOU NEED TO

00:38:46.791 --> 00:38:48.092
KNOW A FINE THAT'S REALLY GONNA

00:38:48.159 --> 00:38:50.761
BE LIQUID FOR TEN YEARS AND OVER

00:38:50.828 --> 00:38:51.729
TIME IT'LL TELL OUT.

00:38:51.796 --> 00:38:53.030
MAYBE WANT TO THINK ABOUT COST

00:38:53.097 --> 00:38:54.098
RECOVERY FOR FORM THAT WAY

00:38:54.165 --> 00:38:55.499
REVISITING YOU'RE LOOKING AT IT

00:38:55.566 --> 00:38:57.234
AGAIN IN SEVERAL YEARS BUT FOR

00:38:57.301 --> 00:38:58.102
NOW.

00:38:58.169 --> 00:38:59.804
I THINK WE'RE TRYING TO

00:38:59.870 --> 00:39:01.372
RECOMMEND HOW DO YOU.

00:39:01.439 --> 00:39:02.306
YEAH HOW DO YOU STOP OF THE

00:39:02.373 --> 00:39:03.774
INCREASING COST OF CERTAINTY AND

00:39:03.841 --> 00:39:05.676
UNTIL THERE SOME REAL CLEAR

00:39:05.743 --> 00:39:07.945
DIRECTION ABOUT WHERE THIS ENDS

00:39:08.012 --> 00:39:09.380
I THINK WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE

00:39:09.447 --> 00:39:10.147
TO SEE.

00:39:10.214 --> 00:39:11.816
POTENTIALLY YOU KNOW MORE

00:39:11.882 --> 00:39:13.751
DOWNGRADES MORE BANKRUPTCIES AND

00:39:13.818 --> 00:39:15.519
LESS RESOLUTION FOR WELFARE

00:39:15.586 --> 00:39:16.754
VICTIMS I GUESS FOLLOWS GERMANS

00:39:16.821 --> 00:39:18.122
ONE MOMENT THAT'S EXACTLY I'M

00:39:18.189 --> 00:39:20.324
TRYING TO GET TO GIVEN THE FACT

00:39:20.391 --> 00:39:21.726
THAT WE JUST GOT THIS FROM.

00:39:21.792 --> 00:39:23.694
WE GOT MOODY'S REPORT NOW WE

00:39:23.761 --> 00:39:25.963
JUST GOT THE REPORT FROM FROM --

00:39:26.030 --> 00:39:27.932
STANDARD AND POOR'S THAT THE

00:39:27.998 --> 00:39:29.533
IMPLEMENTATION IF YOU WANTED TO

00:39:29.600 --> 00:39:30.768
TALK ABOUT.

00:39:30.835 --> 00:39:32.903
THE INVERSE AND IT REQUIRES A

00:39:32.970 --> 00:39:34.405
BALLOT INITIATIVE FOR PEOPLE TO

00:39:34.472 --> 00:39:37.007
BE COMFORTABLE THERE'S NO WAY

00:39:37.074 --> 00:39:37.975
THE THE YOU KNOW WE'VE GOT THE

00:39:38.042 --> 00:39:40.277
SITUATION WE HAVE INVESTOR OWNED

00:39:40.344 --> 00:39:41.779
UTILITIES AS I SEE IT.

00:39:41.846 --> 00:39:43.547
AND THEY NEED TO BE STABILIZE IT

00:39:43.614 --> 00:39:44.749
CROSSES FIVE HUNDRED MILLION

00:39:44.815 --> 00:39:45.316
DOLLARS A WEEK WHEN CENTER

00:39:45.382 --> 00:39:47.118
JACKSON AYE WERE HERE SOME TIME

00:39:47.184 --> 00:39:48.052
AGO.

00:39:48.119 --> 00:39:49.587
AT THE STATE ACTUALLY PAYING

00:39:49.653 --> 00:39:54.158
THOSE COSTS CORRECT AND SO THE

00:39:54.225 --> 00:39:55.826
QUESTION IS.

00:39:55.893 --> 00:39:56.827
WHAT'S UP WITH THE SUCH AS THE

00:39:56.894 --> 00:39:58.129
BROUGHT IDEAS FOR A PIECE OF

00:39:58.195 --> 00:39:58.763
PAPER WE'RE NOW IN A SITUATION

00:39:58.829 --> 00:40:00.598
WHERE WE'RE TOLD BY STANDARD AND

00:40:00.664 --> 00:40:02.900
POOR'S YOU GOT TO JULY TWELFTH

00:40:02.967 --> 00:40:03.367
LADIES AND GENTLEMAN.

00:40:03.434 --> 00:40:05.569
AND PART OF THAT IS GOING TO BE

00:40:05.636 --> 00:40:07.705
THIS ODD SITUATION YOU CORRECTLY

00:40:07.772 --> 00:40:11.075
IDENTIFY IS TO INSPIRE-CONFIDENCE THE EARTHQUAKE

00:40:11.142 --> 00:40:12.009
AUTHORITY.

00:40:12.076 --> 00:40:13.043
WE HAD THIS HORRIBLE EARTHQUAKE

00:40:13.110 --> 00:40:14.111
AUTHORITY THE COMMUNITIES THAT I

00:40:14.178 --> 00:40:16.413
REPRESENT AND THE GOOD NEWS IS

00:40:16.480 --> 00:40:16.947
WE HAVEN'T HAD ANOTHER BIG

00:40:17.014 --> 00:40:18.549
EARTHQUAKE SO WE HAVING A

00:40:18.616 --> 00:40:20.017
PROBLEM WE DON'T HAVE ANOTHER

00:40:20.084 --> 00:40:21.085
BIG WILD FIRE.

00:40:21.152 --> 00:40:23.521
BUT THIS BANKRUPTCY IN THIS IN

00:40:23.587 --> 00:40:25.256
SECURITY IS CAUSED BY THE

00:40:25.322 --> 00:40:26.957
CONCERN THAT WE MIGHT.

00:40:27.024 --> 00:40:29.026
AND SO OUR JOB IS TO PROTECT

00:40:29.093 --> 00:40:30.995
AGAINST IF WE MIKE TO GIVE

00:40:31.061 --> 00:40:32.730
CONFIDENCE AS YOU SUGGESTED FOR

00:40:32.797 --> 00:40:34.298
THE PEOPLE WHO WANT TO INVEST IN

00:40:34.365 --> 00:40:35.733
THEIR UTILITIES IN CALIFORNIA SO

00:40:35.800 --> 00:40:36.734
IT SEEMS TO ME.

00:40:36.801 --> 00:40:38.636
IS A FOUNDATIONAL QUESTION AS WE

00:40:38.702 --> 00:40:41.305
APPROACH THIS PROBLEM SOLVING WE

00:40:41.372 --> 00:40:43.574
HAVE TO BE GUIDED AT ITS CORE

00:40:43.641 --> 00:40:46.110
ADDITIONALLY BY HOW MUCH CAPITAL

00:40:46.177 --> 00:40:47.244
IS GOING TO COST US WHAT'S IT

00:40:47.311 --> 00:40:48.746
GOING TO COST RATE PAYERS AND

00:40:48.813 --> 00:40:49.880
EVERYBODY ELSE.

00:40:49.947 --> 00:40:51.348
IF PEOPLE DON'T HAVE CONFIDENCE

00:40:51.415 --> 00:40:52.616
AND THE RATINGS ARE TURN ARE ARE

00:40:52.683 --> 00:40:54.585
TURNED INTO JUNK WE HAVE TO MAKE

00:40:54.652 --> 00:40:55.553
SURE WE HAVE TRIPLE A RATING

00:40:55.619 --> 00:40:57.388
BONDS AND SO EVERY DECISION WE

00:40:57.454 --> 00:40:58.022
MAKE.

00:40:58.088 --> 00:40:59.390
HAVE TO BE IMPLEMENTED IN THE

00:40:59.456 --> 00:41:01.492
PROCESS AND MAYBE AT THE END OF

00:41:01.559 --> 00:41:02.593
THAT PROCESS YOU COULD LOOK AT

00:41:02.660 --> 00:41:04.528
THE LIABILITY ISSUE BUT THAT'S

00:41:04.595 --> 00:41:06.230
NOT WHAT WE LEAD OFF FROM.

00:41:06.297 --> 00:41:07.865
AND THAT WE HAVE TO COME UP WITH

00:41:07.932 --> 00:41:09.500
AT THE CORE OF WHAT WE'RE DOING.

00:41:09.567 --> 00:41:11.435
INSPIRING CONFIDENCE IN THE

00:41:11.502 --> 00:41:13.370
FINANCIAL MARKETS SO THAT PEOPLE

00:41:13.437 --> 00:41:14.805
KNOW THAT THAT THEIR COST OF

00:41:14.872 --> 00:41:16.307
BORROWING COST OF THE UTILITY

00:41:16.373 --> 00:41:18.209
RATES ARE NOT GOING TO GO UP AND

00:41:18.275 --> 00:41:19.443
THAT THERE'S MONEY AVAILABLE TO

00:41:19.510 --> 00:41:20.911
PAY FOR VICTIMS.

00:41:20.978 --> 00:41:21.445
AND SERVE THE PEOPLE OF

00:41:21.512 --> 00:41:23.347
CALIFORNIA AND I JUST TALK ABOUT

00:41:23.414 --> 00:41:24.849
THIS IN BROAD TERMS THIS

00:41:24.915 --> 00:41:26.550
CRITICALLY IMPORTANT THAT WE ARE

00:41:26.617 --> 00:41:27.685
THE PLACE WITH THE PRACTICAL

00:41:27.751 --> 00:41:29.286
HAPPENS WITH THE RUBBR MEETS

00:41:29.353 --> 00:41:30.487
THE ROAD AND WE HAVE TO FIGURE

00:41:30.554 --> 00:41:32.089
THAT SOLUTION.

00:41:32.156 --> 00:41:35.826
AND WHAT THE IMPLEMENTATION

00:41:35.893 --> 00:41:37.361
LOOKS LIKE.

00:41:37.428 --> 00:41:38.128
THE END I DON'T DISAGREE I THINK

00:41:38.195 --> 00:41:38.896
THE LAST POINT I WOULD MAKE IS

00:41:38.963 --> 00:41:39.496
THAT ALL OF THESE THINGS ARE

00:41:39.563 --> 00:41:41.465
DIFFERENT TIME HORIZONS AND HAVE.

00:41:41.532 --> 00:41:42.333
DIFFERENT LEGAL CHALLENGES AND

00:41:42.399 --> 00:41:44.568
SO -- I THINK YOUR POINT IS WELL

00:41:44.635 --> 00:41:46.604
TAKEN MAY THE I THINK THE

00:41:46.670 --> 00:41:48.138
REPORS NOTE THAT THEY WOULD

00:41:48.205 --> 00:41:49.206
LIKE TO SEE A CHANGE THE COST

00:41:49.273 --> 00:41:50.341
RECOVERY STANDARD THAT'S

00:41:50.407 --> 00:41:51.742
PROBABLY THE MOST DIRECTING THAT

00:41:51.809 --> 00:41:54.178
YOU CAN DO -- TO INCREASE

00:41:54.245 --> 00:41:55.412
INVESTOR CONFIDENCE.

00:41:55.479 --> 00:41:56.981
WE WANT TO BE SENSITIVE TO THE

00:41:57.047 --> 00:41:59.116
FACT THAT THAT ON ITS OWN COULD

00:41:59.183 --> 00:42:00.317
JUST SHIFT COSTS ONLY TO

00:42:00.384 --> 00:42:01.585
ELECTRIC CUSTOMERS WHICH WILL

00:42:01.652 --> 00:42:05.289
NOT BE SUSTAINABLE -- BUT I

00:42:05.356 --> 00:42:05.923

00:45:27.191 --> 00:45:29.293
THE KEY IS TO REQUIRE A CLEAR

WHILE FOR THAT WE SEE VICTIMS

00:46:00.858 --> 00:46:02.292
WHOSE -- INSURANCE LIMITS DO NOT

00:46:02.359 --> 00:46:06.463
COME EVEN CLOSE TO COVERING THE

00:46:07.898 --> 00:46:08.465
THE PROBLEM THIS PROBLEM

00:46:08.532 --> 00:46:09.133
DECREASES THE ABILITY FOR

IN THE STATE BUDGET OR SO CAN

00:57:08.691 --> 00:57:09.592
YOU ABSOLUTELY AWAY IN ON THAT

00:57:09.659 --> 00:57:10.994
SO YOU KNOW THE THE PREMISE ON

00:57:11.060 --> 00:57:13.363
ALL THE SOLUTIONS ARE BEING

00:57:13.429 --> 00:57:13.930
DISCUSSED AT THE LEGISLATIVE

00:57:13.997 --> 00:57:14.831
LEVEL.

00:57:14.898 --> 00:57:16.432
ALL HAVE TO HAVE SOME SORT OF

00:57:16.499 --> 00:57:18.201
COMPONENT OF MEDICATION.

00:57:18.268 --> 00:57:20.036
BECAUSE EVEN IF YOU HAVE A

00:57:20.103 --> 00:57:22.071
CONVERSATION ABOUT YOU KNOW WHAT

00:57:22.138 --> 00:57:23.239
ARE WE GONNA DO WITH INVERSE

00:57:23.306 --> 00:57:24.007
WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO WITH THE

00:57:24.073 --> 00:57:25.742
FIND AT THE END OF THE DAY

00:57:25.809 --> 00:57:27.343
SOMEBODY'S GOING TO PAY. FOR

00:57:27.410 --> 00:57:28.645
THAT RIGHT AND YOU'RE GONNA PAY

00:57:28.711 --> 00:57:30.780
THROUGH YOUR YOUR INSURANCE

00:57:30.847 --> 00:57:31.881
POLICY YOU'RE GONNA PAY THROUGH

00:57:31.948 --> 00:57:35.785
YOUR ENERGY BILL -- AND THE FACT

00:57:35.852 --> 00:57:39.122
IS THAT WE HAVE TO FIGURE OUT

00:57:39.189 --> 00:57:40.490
HOW DO WE GET AHEAD OF THIS

00:57:40.557 --> 00:57:40.990
PROBLEM.

00:57:41.057 --> 00:57:42.792
AND BY REALLY FOCUSING ON

00:57:42.859 --> 00:57:44.727
MITIGATION ANY FUND THAT WE

00:57:44.794 --> 00:57:46.429
CREATE SHOULD HAVE A PERCENTAGE

00:57:46.496 --> 00:57:48.298
OF THAT GOING TOWARDS MITIGATION

00:57:48.364 --> 00:57:50.099
BECAUSE THE END OF THE DAY IF WE

00:57:50.166 --> 00:57:51.401
REDUCE THE RISK.

00:57:51.467 --> 00:57:53.837
WE GET THE INSURANCE COMPANIES

00:57:53.903 --> 00:57:54.771
TO ONE STAY AND HOPEFULLY

00:57:54.838 --> 00:57:57.040
CONTINUE TO WRITE IN THE

00:57:57.106 --> 00:57:58.441
SENSITIVE AREAS RIGHT.

00:57:58.508 --> 00:58:00.677
SO THE DEPARTMENT'S VISION IS

00:58:00.743 --> 00:58:02.645
WHATEVER WE DO IN THE

00:58:02.712 --> 00:58:05.081
LEGISLATIVE ARENA OR TO THE

00:58:05.148 --> 00:58:07.617
GOVERNOR IT HAS TO HAVE A

00:58:07.684 --> 00:58:08.785
MEETING A CLEAR MITIGATION

00:58:08.852 --> 00:58:09.619
COMPONENT.

00:58:09.686 --> 00:58:11.921
WITH CLEAR POLICIES NOT ONLY AT

00:58:11.988 --> 00:58:13.756
THE INDIVIDUAL HOME LEVEL BUT AT

00:58:13.823 --> 00:58:15.258
THE COMMUNITY LEVEL RIGHT

00:58:15.325 --> 00:58:17.694
BECAUSE IF AND WE SEE THIS TIME

00:58:17.760 --> 00:58:19.662
AND TIME AGAIN FROM.

00:58:19.729 --> 00:58:21.130
YOU KNOW MALIBU TO SANTA ROSA

00:58:21.197 --> 00:58:21.798
THERE ARE FOLKS THAT DID

00:58:21.865 --> 00:58:25.335
ABSOLUTELY EVERYTHING TO

00:58:25.401 --> 00:58:26.970
MITIGATE BUT THEIR NEIGHBORS DID.

00:58:27.036 --> 00:58:28.004
RIGHT AND SO THERE'S A MAYBE

00:58:28.071 --> 00:58:29.105
THAT WOULD HAVE IMPACTED IF WE

00:58:29.172 --> 00:58:29.939
ALL WOULD HAVE COME TOGETHER AS

00:58:30.006 --> 00:58:30.974
A COMMUNITY TO HAVE DONE THAT

00:58:31.040 --> 00:58:32.742
BUT ALSO WHAT ARE THE

00:58:32.809 --> 00:58:33.576
RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE LOCAL

00:58:33.643 --> 00:58:35.044
GOVERNMENT. TO INITIATE

00:58:35.111 --> 00:58:37.580
MITIGATION METHODS RIGHT AND AND

00:58:37.647 --> 00:58:38.448
STRATEGIES WITHIN THEIR

00:58:38.514 --> 00:58:40.817
COMMUNITY AS NOW YOU KNOW.

00:58:40.884 --> 00:58:43.386
DO WE HAVE THE THE THE THE PROP

00:58:43.453 --> 00:58:45.188
THE PROPERTY GRAYSON INGRESS --

00:58:45.255 --> 00:58:47.557
SO THAT WE CAN BE ABLE TO ACCESS

00:58:47.624 --> 00:58:48.958
FOLKS YOU KNOW FOLKS THAT

00:58:49.025 --> 00:58:51.327
PERISHED IN IN IN PARADISE

00:58:51.394 --> 00:58:54.063
LITERALLY THERE WAS ONE ROAD IN.

00:58:54.130 --> 00:58:55.798
AND WE COULD YOU I WAS TOO LATE

00:58:55.865 --> 00:58:57.367
FOR FOLKS TO TRY TO GET OUT ONCE

00:58:57.433 --> 00:58:58.201
THE SMOKING MAN.

00:58:58.268 --> 00:58:59.869
SO OUR APPROACH THE DEPARTMENT

00:58:59.936 --> 00:59:01.037
IS.

00:59:01.104 --> 00:59:02.639
WHATEVER SOLUTION WE COME TO IT

00:59:02.705 --> 00:59:04.340
HAS TO HAVE A MITIGATION

00:59:04.407 --> 00:59:06.075
APPROACH SO THAT AT AND IT'S

00:59:06.142 --> 00:59:06.743
GOING TO BE CLEAR AND

00:59:06.809 --> 00:59:08.845
UNDERSTANDABLE SO THAT WE CAN

00:59:08.912 --> 00:59:11.080
THEN AT THE DEPARTMENT MEASURE.

00:59:11.147 --> 00:59:12.548
IF THEY'RE BEING APPROPRIATE

00:59:12.615 --> 00:59:14.884
WHEN IT COMES TO THAT SO -- THAT

00:59:14.951 --> 00:59:17.287
IS ESSENTIALLY THE MESSAGE WE I

00:59:17.353 --> 00:59:18.755
I COME TO BRING IS.

00:59:18.821 --> 00:59:20.490
WHATEVER WE DECIDE LET'S MAKE

00:59:20.556 --> 00:59:21.658
SURE THAT IT HAS TO HAVE A

00:59:21.724 --> 00:59:22.792
ROBUST.

00:59:22.859 --> 00:59:24.193
MITIGATION COMPONENT BECAUSE

00:59:24.260 --> 00:59:25.929
THAT'S WHAT ALLOWS US TO GET

00:59:25.995 --> 00:59:28.231
AHEAD OF THE GAME IT ALLOWS US

00:59:28.298 --> 00:59:30.600
TO THEN MAKE THE THE PAGE FOR

00:59:30.667 --> 00:59:32.568
THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY THE STATE

00:59:32.635 --> 00:59:33.670
AND RIGHT IN THESE COMMUNITIES --

00:59:33.736 --> 00:59:36.105
AND THEN WE CAN DEMONSTRATE JUST

00:59:36.172 --> 00:59:37.540
AS WE'RE DEMONSTRATING AND AND

00:59:37.607 --> 00:59:39.008
IN THIS COLORADO EXAMPLE IS IF

00:59:39.075 --> 00:59:40.043
IT'S DONE IN A WAY THAT IT'S

00:59:40.109 --> 00:59:42.912
COMMUNAL IN THE ENTIRE COMMUNITY.

00:59:42.979 --> 00:59:45.048
THEN WE CAN GO BACK TO JUST COME

00:59:45.114 --> 00:59:46.449
TO SAY WELL YOU HAVE TO WRITE

00:59:46.516 --> 00:59:48.017
THESE IN THESE AREAS RIGHT.

00:59:48.084 --> 00:59:52.021
SO WHATEVER WE DO I'M SAYING IS

00:59:52.088 --> 00:59:53.456
WE NEED TO HAVE THAT MEDICATION.

00:59:53.523 --> 00:59:54.991
I COULDN'T AGREE MORE AND I FEEL

00:59:55.058 --> 00:59:55.658
IT IS THE ONE AREA WHERE WE MAY

00:59:55.725 --> 00:59:56.826
BE A LITTLE BIT BEHIND I KNOW

00:59:56.893 --> 00:59:59.028

WE YOU KNOW WE'VE MANDATE

01:00:44.007 --> 01:00:46.075

WE TALKED YOU KNOW GOOD DRIVERS.

01:00:47.510 --> 01:00:48.444
WERE REASONABLE DRIVER YOU'LL

NEED TO PROVIDE INSURANCE

01:00:50.279 --> 01:00:52.749
COVERAGE FOR THEM BUT AGAIN THE

01:00:52.815 --> 01:00:55.184
FACT IS THAT WE NEED TO FOCUS ON

01:00:55.251 --> 01:00:56.719
THE THE THE MITIGATION PART THE

01:00:56.786 --> 01:00:58.321
RESILIENCY PART BECAUSE NO

AFFORD THEM ANYWAYS RIGHT.

01:01:07.864 --> 01:01:09.565
SO AGAIN NOT THAT IT'S A SILVER

01:01:09.632 --> 01:01:11.000
BULLET BUT I THINK IT IS REALLY

01:01:11.067 --> 01:01:13.569
KEY TO WHATEVER WE MAKE IS THAT

01:01:13.636 --> 01:01:15.438
HOW DO WE GET AHEAD OF THE GAME.

01:01:15.505 --> 01:01:16.706
HOW DO WE THEN HAVE THE TOUGH

01:03:23.366 --> 01:03:23.966
COLLEAGUE FROM THE NORTH COAST.

01:03:24.033 --> 01:03:25.968
IT SAYS THAT THE VAST MAJORITY

01:03:26.035 --> 01:03:29.138
OF HOME INSURANCE IF INDICATE

01:03:29.205 --> 01:03:30.806
97% IS FROM THE TRADITIONAL

01:03:30.873 --> 01:03:32.408
ADMITTED CARRIERS THEN THEY SAY

01:03:32.475 --> 01:03:34.277
ANOTHER 1%.

01:03:34.343 --> 01:03:36.579
IS FROM THIS -- SURPLUS LINES

01:03:36.646 --> 01:03:41.284
AND WE ONLY HAVE THIRTY FOUR

01:03:41.350 --> 01:03:41.918
THOUSAND PEOPLE THAT ARE IN THE

01:03:41.984 --> 01:03:42.385
FAIR PLAN.

01:03:42.451 --> 01:03:44.253
SO IS IT THE CONSUMER THE JUST

01:03:44.320 --> 01:03:45.655
THE SIZE THAT THEY DON'T WANT TO

01:03:45.721 --> 01:03:48.090
HAVE INSURANCE OR IS THERE.

01:03:48.157 --> 01:03:49.358
IS IT THE INSURER.

01:03:49.425 --> 01:03:50.626
YOU KNOW IF THE IT SEEMS LIKE

01:03:50.693 --> 01:03:51.427
THEY'VE GOT THESE THREE

01:03:51.494 --> 01:03:53.963
ALTERNATIVES SAY THE MARKET THE

01:03:54.030 --> 01:03:57.633
SURPLUS LINES IN THE FAIR PLAN --

01:03:57.700 --> 01:03:58.668
BECAUSE YOU KNOW WE HAVE

01:03:58.734 --> 01:04:00.803
UNINSURED SO THAT'S A THAT'S A

01:04:00.870 --> 01:04:02.872
PERSON WHO OWNS A HOUSE MAYBE

01:04:02.939 --> 01:04:04.473
WITH THEIR LIFE SAVINGS SAVINGS

01:04:04.540 --> 01:04:06.242
THAT SAY THEY'RE GONNA GO NAKED

01:04:06.309 --> 01:04:07.410
SO I'M WONDER.

01:04:07.476 --> 01:04:08.978
IS I I WANT TO MAKE IT

01:04:09.045 --> 01:04:10.413
AFFORDABLE AND AND DO THAT BUT

01:04:10.479 --> 01:04:12.748
IS IT THAT BIG OF A PROBLEM I

01:04:12.815 --> 01:04:14.717
GUESS IN YOUR WELL YOU KNOW

01:04:14.784 --> 01:04:16.052
THAT'S THAT'S BEEN CHANGING

01:04:16.118 --> 01:04:18.788
ESPECIALLY AFTER LAST YEAR -- WE

01:04:18.854 --> 01:04:20.523
WE ARE SEEING AN UPTICK -- OF

01:04:20.590 --> 01:04:22.325
FOLKS UTILIZING THE ACTUAL FAIR

01:04:22.391 --> 01:04:26.529
PLAN -- AGAIN WE DON'T FEEL IT'S

01:04:26.596 --> 01:04:28.097
IT YOU KNOW IT'S REALLY THE

01:04:28.164 --> 01:04:29.498
FUTURE OF LAST RESORT.

01:04:29.565 --> 01:04:33.736
BUT IN TERMS OF PEOPLE GOING

01:04:33.803 --> 01:04:36.205
WITHOUT INSURANCE I MEAN HE YOU

01:04:36.272 --> 01:04:36.806
NEED THE INSURANCE TO BE A BIT

01:04:36.872 --> 01:04:39.775
OF THE OUT TO TAKE THE HOME OUT

01:04:39.842 --> 01:04:43.546
SO -- I DON'T I DON'T I MEAN I

01:04:43.613 --> 01:04:44.914
BY THE WAY LET ME I FORGOT TO

01:04:44.981 --> 01:04:47.516
INTRODUCE JILL ARCHER MY AS A

01:04:47.583 --> 01:04:48.618
SPECIAL DEPUTY -- IN THE

01:04:48.684 --> 01:04:50.386
DEPARTMENT WHO'S BEEN HELPING ME

01:04:50.453 --> 01:04:51.854
DEAL WITH A LOT OF THESE ISSUES

01:04:51.921 --> 01:04:52.488
I DIDN'T A GUEST THERE'S A

01:04:52.555 --> 01:04:53.422
PHENOMENA THAT GOES ON IS WHEN

01:04:53.489 --> 01:04:54.290
YOU HAVE A MORTGAGE YOU

01:04:54.357 --> 01:04:55.825
OBVIOUSLY HAVE TO HAVE INSURANCE

01:04:55.891 --> 01:04:57.026
WHAT HAPPENS IS PEOPLE.

01:04:57.093 --> 01:04:58.828
PAY OFF THEIR MORTGAGE AND THEN

01:04:58.894 --> 01:05:00.096
THEY CANCEL THEIR INSURANCE.

01:05:00.162 --> 01:05:02.265
IN A WHICH IS YOUR RESPONSIBLE

01:05:02.331 --> 01:05:04.367
BEHAVIOR ESPECIALLY GIVEN

01:05:04.433 --> 01:05:05.935
CLIMATE CHANGE AND THE INCREASED

01:05:06.002 --> 01:05:07.303
DANGER I THINK THERE'S JUST THIS

01:05:07.370 --> 01:05:08.871
EXPECTATION THAT.

01:05:08.938 --> 01:05:10.172
IN VERSUS GOING TO PAY FOR

01:05:10.239 --> 01:05:11.307
EVERYTHING AND I'M GONNA BE MADE

01:05:11.374 --> 01:05:13.009
WHOLE AND THAT NOT A LOT OF

01:05:13.075 --> 01:05:17.280
PEOPLE BUT THERE THERE ARE WE'VE

01:05:17.346 --> 01:05:19.115
TALKED ABOUT IN THE REPORT.

01:05:19.181 --> 01:05:20.082
WE DON'T KNOW THE NUMBERS OF

01:05:20.149 --> 01:05:20.516
UNINSURED.

01:05:20.583 --> 01:05:21.384
THE PEOPLE WE DO KNOW THAT THE

01:05:21.450 --> 01:05:23.286
FAIR PLAN WHICH RIGHTS MAY BE

01:05:23.352 --> 01:05:26.088
CLOSER CLOSER TO A HUNDRED AND

01:05:26.155 --> 01:05:27.223
THIRTY THOUSAND HOMES --

01:05:27.290 --> 01:05:28.758
CURRENTLY BUT THAT NUMBER HAS

01:05:28.824 --> 01:05:31.494
BEEN INCREASING DRAMATICALLY IN

01:05:31.560 --> 01:05:34.130
WILDFIRE AREAS WHILE IT IS GOING

01:05:34.196 --> 01:05:35.731
DOWN AND URBAN AREAS.

01:05:35.798 --> 01:05:38.100
SO IT IS A SMALL NUMBER AND THE

01:05:38.167 --> 01:05:39.802
THE A SURPLUS LINES MIGHT HAVE

01:05:39.869 --> 01:05:41.470
ONLY HAD TWENTY THOUSAND

01:05:41.537 --> 01:05:42.538
POLICIES.

01:05:42.605 --> 01:05:43.739
A YEAR OR TWO AGO AND NOW

01:05:43.806 --> 01:05:46.409
THEY'RE UP TO SIXTY SEVENTY

01:05:46.475 --> 01:05:47.076
THOUSAND POLICIES.

01:05:47.143 --> 01:05:48.811
SO WHILE THE NUMBERS ARE STILL

01:05:48.878 --> 01:05:50.813
VERY SMALL AND THOSE ARE KIND

01:05:50.880 --> 01:05:51.914
END OF LAST YEAR.

01:05:51.981 --> 01:05:54.083
WE THINK THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF A

01:05:54.150 --> 01:05:55.618
LOT OF COMPLAINTS I'M SURE THAT

01:05:55.685 --> 01:05:57.019
PEOPLE ARE HEARING.

01:05:57.086 --> 01:05:58.721
IN MANY DISTRICTS OF PEOPLE

01:05:58.788 --> 01:06:00.656
BEING NON RENEWED OR HAVING

01:06:00.723 --> 01:06:02.458
THEIR PREMIUMS.

01:06:02.525 --> 01:06:05.027
RADICALLY INCREASE SO THOSE ARE

01:06:05.094 --> 01:06:07.430
KIND OF THEIR JUST SIGNALS.

01:06:07.496 --> 01:06:09.231
BUT YET AT THIS MOMENT YOU WOULD

01:06:09.298 --> 01:06:11.100
SAY YES THE MARKET PLACE IS

01:06:11.167 --> 01:06:12.368
RESPONDING.

01:06:12.435 --> 01:06:13.536
BUT IF YOU'RE IN SOME OF THESE

01:06:13.602 --> 01:06:15.805
OUTLYING AREAS OR HIGHER RISK

01:06:15.871 --> 01:06:18.240
AREAS YOU WOULD SAY THERE'S A

01:06:18.307 --> 01:06:18.474
CRISIS.

01:06:18.541 --> 01:06:19.542
IN A A QUESTION ON THE

01:06:19.608 --> 01:06:22.611
MEDICATION NOT [inaudible]

01:06:22.678 --> 01:06:25.348
TO NOT TO BEAT.

01:06:25.414 --> 01:06:26.515
ORGAN BE BETTER HERE BUT THE

01:06:26.582 --> 01:06:27.483
SENATE VERSION FOR LONG TERM

01:06:27.550 --> 01:06:29.952
RESILIENCY INVESTMENT ON THE CAP

01:06:30.019 --> 01:06:30.886
AND TRADE THE HUNDRED MILLION

01:06:30.953 --> 01:06:32.254
DOLLARS WAS NOT.

01:06:32.321 --> 01:06:33.689
ACCEPTED BY THE ADMINISTRATION

01:06:33.756 --> 01:06:35.458
NOR WAS THE REGIONAL FOREST

01:06:35.524 --> 01:06:37.393
RESTORATION PROJECTS THAT WE PUT

01:06:37.460 --> 01:06:38.494
IN FOR HEALTHY FOREST WAS

01:06:38.561 --> 01:06:40.730
REJECTED BY THIS ADMINISTRATION

01:06:40.796 --> 01:06:43.032
BUT WITH THAT SAID -- YOU KNOW

01:06:43.099 --> 01:06:44.934
THE STATE LACKS THE ABILITY TO

01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:46.402
PLACE A LIEN ON PEOPLE'S

01:06:46.469 --> 01:06:47.503
PROPERTY.

01:06:47.570 --> 01:06:48.804
THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT CAN DO IT

01:06:48.871 --> 01:06:50.706
THE CITY CAN DO IT THE WATER

01:06:50.773 --> 01:06:52.141
DISTRICT CAN DO IT BUT THE STATE

01:06:52.208 --> 01:06:54.643
DOESN'T HAVE THE AUTHORITY IF

01:06:54.710 --> 01:06:56.245
WE'RE REALLY SERIOUS ABOUT

01:06:56.312 --> 01:06:58.514
HARDENING AND HARDENING ASSETS

01:06:58.581 --> 01:06:59.749
AND TREE REMOVAL FOR THE

01:06:59.815 --> 01:07:00.683
MEDICATION.

01:07:00.750 --> 01:07:04.053
WE DON'T HAVE THAT TOOL TO IN

01:07:04.120 --> 01:07:06.188
FOR SAY WE WILL REMOVE THE TREE

01:07:06.255 --> 01:07:06.989
AND WE WILL.

01:07:07.056 --> 01:07:09.158
CHARGE YOU HOMEOWNER AND WE'LL

01:07:09.225 --> 01:07:12.294
PUT IT ON BECAUSE OUR GUESTS

01:07:12.361 --> 01:07:13.396
THAT'S ANOTHER TOOL YOU THINK

01:07:13.462 --> 01:07:16.132
IT'S AN IMPORTANT TOOL OR NOT A

01:07:16.198 --> 01:07:18.334
NECESSARY TOOL WELL I I CAN ONLY

01:07:18.401 --> 01:07:19.702
SPEAK TOWARDS WHAT I'VE HEARD

01:07:19.769 --> 01:07:22.872
FROM.

01:07:22.938 --> 01:07:25.975
AND IT SEEMS TO ME THAT FOLKS --

01:07:26.041 --> 01:07:26.809
FAIL TO DO THE APPROPRIATE

01:07:26.876 --> 01:07:28.411
HARDENING ONE BECAUSE THEY JUST

01:07:28.477 --> 01:07:29.345
CAN'T AFFORD IT.

01:07:29.412 --> 01:07:30.780
I AND THEY'RE ALREADY PAYING

01:07:30.846 --> 01:07:34.183
VERY HIGH PREMIUMS -- AND SO

01:07:34.250 --> 01:07:37.119
WHEN THE DEVASTATION HAPPENS.

01:07:37.186 --> 01:07:38.721
THE LEAST OF THE CONSIDER TRYING

01:07:38.788 --> 01:07:40.923
JUST TO GET THE DWELLING BACK

01:07:40.990 --> 01:07:43.325
AND MANY OF THEM SAY I I CAN'T

01:07:43.392 --> 01:07:47.129
AFFORD THE THE THE THE UPGRADES.

01:07:47.196 --> 01:07:48.631
HENCE WHY AGAIN THE COVERAGE A

01:07:48.697 --> 01:07:51.267
IS CRITICAL BUT I DON'T THINK

01:07:51.333 --> 01:07:53.369
WE'RE AT A POINT WHERE -- FOR

01:07:53.436 --> 01:07:54.770
ITS NOT THAT FOLKS ARE JUST NOT

01:07:54.837 --> 01:07:56.672
WILLING TO DO IT. ONE THERE'S

01:07:56.739 --> 01:07:58.641
NOT A CLEAR BENCHMARK OF WHAT

01:07:58.707 --> 01:08:00.376
SHOULD BE DONE. TO HARDEN YOUR

01:08:00.443 --> 01:08:02.344
HOME IN A IN A GIVEN COMMUNITY

01:08:02.411 --> 01:08:04.113
COMMUNITIES ARE VERY DIFFERENT

01:08:04.180 --> 01:08:05.881
FROM OBVIOUSLY AS WE KNOW FROM

01:08:05.948 --> 01:08:07.316
TOWN TO TOWN.

01:08:07.383 --> 01:08:09.051
AND REGION TO REGION FILTERS

01:08:09.118 --> 01:08:11.287
IT'S HARDER TO PROVIDE A SET

01:08:11.353 --> 01:08:13.088
RECOMMENDATION WHY WE THINK YOU

01:08:13.155 --> 01:08:15.324
KNOW CAL FIRE THE DEPARTMENT AND

01:08:15.391 --> 01:08:15.925
ALTHOUGH THOSE OF US THAT DO

01:08:15.991 --> 01:08:16.625
THIS WORK.

01:08:16.692 --> 01:08:17.593
SHOULD COME TOGETHER TO FIGURE

01:08:17.660 --> 01:08:20.362
OUT FOR THE COMMUNITY A WHAT

01:08:20.429 --> 01:08:21.597
WOULD BE THE APPROPRIATE.

01:08:21.664 --> 01:08:23.232
MITIGATION MEASURES AND

01:08:23.299 --> 01:08:24.900
HARDENING MEASURES FOR THAT

01:08:24.967 --> 01:08:27.069
COMMUNITY SO THAT THEN WE COULD

01:08:27.136 --> 01:08:30.506
PUT THAT INTO -- AWAIT THAT'S

01:08:30.573 --> 01:08:31.740
EASY FOR THEM TO UNDERSTAND SO

01:08:31.807 --> 01:08:33.476
WE KNOW CLEARLY WHAT THE TO DO

01:08:33.542 --> 01:08:35.177
COMMUNITY BE YOU NEED TO DO THIS.

01:08:35.244 --> 01:08:36.946
IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO YOU SEE

01:08:37.012 --> 01:08:38.414
TO RAIN TOPOGRAPHY EVERYTHING'S

01:08:38.481 --> 01:08:39.849
DIFFERENT IN THE STATE AND THE

01:08:39.915 --> 01:08:41.550
NEEDS ARE GOING TO BE DIFFERENT

01:08:41.617 --> 01:08:43.686
RIGHT NOW COMMUNITIES -- YOU

01:08:43.752 --> 01:08:44.420
KNOW YOU KNOW WHAT SOME

01:08:44.487 --> 01:08:47.323
STANDARDS ARE BUT YOU REALLY IN

01:08:47.389 --> 01:08:48.224
TERMS OF A COMMUNAL.

01:08:48.290 --> 01:08:50.359
ASPECT WE DON'T HAVE A FRAMEWORK

01:08:50.426 --> 01:08:52.962
OF WHAT PEOPLE SHOULD FOLLOW IN

01:08:53.028 --> 01:08:57.066
A REGIONAL ASPECT OF MEDICATION

01:08:57.132 --> 01:09:00.269
AND AND HARDENING.

01:09:00.336 --> 01:09:04.173
THERE CENTER JACK.

01:09:04.240 --> 01:09:05.541
MISSION FOR BEING WITH US AND

01:09:05.608 --> 01:09:09.245
THANK YOU ALSO TO YOUR STAFF --

01:09:09.311 --> 01:09:10.646
I HAPPEN TO HAVE BEEN THE NON

01:09:10.713 --> 01:09:12.748
RENEWED THIS YEAR AS A RESULT OF

01:09:12.815 --> 01:09:14.917
THE THOMAS FIRE HAVING SPENT

01:09:14.984 --> 01:09:16.285
THIRTY YEARS WITH THE SAME

01:09:16.352 --> 01:09:18.053
INSURANCE COMPANY -- THEY JUST

01:09:18.120 --> 01:09:20.256
SIMPLY T

01:09:20.322 --> 01:09:21.724
RISK IN THIS AREA BY.

01:09:21.790 --> 01:09:24.026
WE'RE WE'RE LEAVING -- AND THE

01:09:24.093 --> 01:09:26.395
PROCESS OF TRYING TO RE RENEW

01:09:26.462 --> 01:09:27.796
HAVING DONE ALL THE THE

01:09:27.863 --> 01:09:29.398
MITIGATION STEPS IS

01:09:29.465 --> 01:09:31.033
EXTRAORDINARY AND SO.

01:09:31.100 --> 01:09:32.968
I WOULD BE VERY INTERESTED IF

01:09:33.035 --> 01:09:35.938
THERE ARE SOME THINGS WE CAN DO --

01:09:36.005 --> 01:09:38.774
THAT WILL -- PUT PRESSURE ON THE

01:09:38.841 --> 01:09:40.075
INSURANCE COMPANIES IN A

01:09:40.142 --> 01:09:41.810
SITUATION WHERE YOU HAVE TAKEN

01:09:41.877 --> 01:09:43.979
ALL THE NECESSARY STEPS AND YOU

01:09:44.046 --> 01:09:44.914
JUST HAPPEN TO LIVE IN THE WILL

01:09:44.980 --> 01:09:45.347
WEAK.

01:09:45.414 --> 01:09:47.349
AND YOU'VE DONE HARDENING OF

01:09:47.416 --> 01:09:50.052
YOUR HOME YOU'VE TAKEN ALL ALL

01:09:50.119 --> 01:09:52.121
MEASURES THAT ARE AVAILABLE --

01:09:52.187 --> 01:09:53.255
IS THERE ANYTHING WE CAN DO

01:09:53.322 --> 01:09:55.357
LEGISLATIVELY TO REQUIRE THE

01:09:55.424 --> 01:09:56.959
INSURANCE COMPANIES MAN I DON'T

01:09:57.026 --> 01:09:57.760
KNOW WHAT THIRTY YEARS OF

01:09:57.826 --> 01:09:59.395
PREMIUMS ARE BUT I CAN ASSURE

01:09:59.461 --> 01:10:00.863
YOU IT'S A LOT MORE THAN WE'VE

01:10:00.930 --> 01:10:02.331
GOTTEN.

01:10:02.398 --> 01:10:05.868
BACK -- ALTHOUGH OF BECAUSE WE

01:10:05.935 --> 01:10:07.536

WE WERE COMPENSATED WHEN WE ST

01:10:18.881 --> 01:10:19.782
ELSEWHERE DURING THAT PERIOD OF

01:10:19.848 --> 01:10:21.150
TIME THESE ARE THE SMALL THINGS

01:10:21.216 --> 01:10:23.052
THAT ACTUALLY ATTENDED THEY CAN

01:10:23.118 --> 01:10:24.787
BE VERY IMPORTANT.

01:10:24.853 --> 01:10:26.455
BUT I'M WONDERING.

01:10:26.522 --> 01:10:29.091

01:10:56.652 --> 01:10:57.786
WRITE INSURANCE.

01:10:57.853 --> 01:10:59.788
BUT WITHIN OUR OWN STATE WHAT

01:10:59.855 --> 01:11:01.590

SURE THEY'RE GOING TO BE

01:11:20.275 --> 01:11:21.343
COMPENSATED.

01:11:21.410 --> 01:11:23.078
IF YOU LOSE THE HOME YOU DON'T

01:11:32.621 --> 01:11:33.789
KINDS OF CONDITIONS.

01:11:33.856 --> 01:11:36.392
WHAT IF ANYTHING CAN WE DO A

01:11:36.458 --> 01:11:38.594
LEGISLATIVELY TO PROTECT AGAINST

TO PROVIDE INSURANCE FOR THOSE

01:11:50.005 --> 01:11:50.939

01:11:59.014 --> 01:12:00.716
EVIDENTIARY DATA DRIVEN

01:12:00.783 --> 01:12:01.650
STANDARDS THAT ARE GOING TO GET

01:12:01.717 --> 01:12:04.253
US TO A POINT WHERE WE CAN PROVE

01:12:04.319 --> 01:12:05.354
THAT THESE TECHNIQUES ARE GOING

01:12:05.421 --> 01:12:05.654

VERY UNIQUE -- BUT THOSE ARE

01:12:17.599 --> 01:12:18.701
PART OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS THAT

01:12:18.767 --> 01:12:20.035

IN PLANNING STANDARDS -- IT ALSO

01:12:48.097 --> 01:12:50.933
REQUIRES RETROFIT PLANS IN THOSE

HOMES THAT ALREADY BUILT IN

01:12:52.234 --> 01:12:53.635

STANDARDS FOR THOSE COMMUNITIES

01:13:03.112 --> 01:13:04.613
ALL OF THE THINGS WERE THOSE AND

01:13:04.680 --> 01:13:05.414
OTHER THINGS THAT WE'RE LOOKING

01:13:05.481 --> 01:13:07.049
AT AS FOR CONTINUE TO HAVE

01:13:07.116 --> 01:13:08.217
CONVERSATIONS WITH THE STRIKE

01:13:08.283 --> 01:13:09.151

RESISTING THE NOTION OF US GOD

01:13:16.425 --> 01:13:17.826
FOR BID TELLING THEM WHAT THEY

01:13:17.893 --> 01:13:19.261
HAVE TO DO TO CONTINUE DOING

01:13:19.328 --> 01:13:20.896
BUSINESS AND MAKING LOTS OF

01:13:20.963 --> 01:13:22.231
MONEY HERE IN CALIFORNIA.

01:13:22.297 --> 01:13:23.098
THE ARMY WERE THERE THE PART OF

01:13:23.165 --> 01:13:24.333
THE DISCUSSIONS WE'VE MET WITH

01:13:24.399 --> 01:13:26.168
THE INDUSTRY TWICE NOW -- THERE

01:13:26.235 --> 01:13:27.569
HAS BEEN VERY FRUITFUL

01:13:27.636 --> 01:13:29.938
DISCUSSIONS IN TERMS OF YOU KNOW

01:13:30.005 --> 01:13:30.839
WHAT.

01:13:30.906 --> 01:13:32.274
ARE THE OBLIGATIONS THAT WE ARE

01:13:32.341 --> 01:13:34.076
EXPECTING OF OF COVERAGE OF

01:13:34.143 --> 01:13:40.883
PEOPLE TO DO THE RIGHT THING --

01:13:40.949 --> 01:13:41.984
BUT ALSO YOU KNOW.

01:13:42.050 --> 01:13:42.618
WE HAVE TO FIGURE OUT HOW THAT

01:13:42.684 --> 01:13:43.952
IMPACTS ULTIMATELY -- THE

01:13:44.019 --> 01:13:46.155
HOMEOWNER IF WE REQUIRE IN FORCE --

01:13:46.221 --> 01:13:47.189
AN INSURANCE PRODUCT THEN IF

01:13:47.256 --> 01:13:49.792
IT'S NOT AFFORDABLE HYDRO.

01:13:49.858 --> 01:13:50.459
WE'RE STILL BACK AT SQUARE ZERO

01:13:50.526 --> 01:13:52.394
ALL RIGHT SO HOW DO WE THEN

01:13:52.461 --> 01:13:54.596
FIGURE OUT -- A BALANCE OF WHAT

01:13:54.663 --> 01:13:58.000
IS A OF MITIGATION EFFORT WAS A

01:13:58.066 --> 01:13:59.535
HEARTENING THAT THE INSURANCE

01:13:59.601 --> 01:14:00.636
COMPANIES ARE GOING TO SEE

01:14:00.702 --> 01:14:01.904
THROUGH DATA AT STRIVE AND THAT

01:14:01.970 --> 01:14:02.538
SAYS.

01:14:02.604 --> 01:14:03.672
THIS CAN ACTUALLY PROTECT YOU

01:14:03.739 --> 01:14:05.607
AND FURTHER MORE IF THE

01:14:05.674 --> 01:14:07.309
COMMUNITY THEN ENGAGES AND THE

01:14:07.376 --> 01:14:09.778
CITY EITHER ON A REGIONAL LEVEL.

01:14:09.845 --> 01:14:12.481
THAT GIVE THE INSURER -- OF A

01:14:12.548 --> 01:14:14.716
BETTER IDEA OF THE FACT THAT

01:14:14.783 --> 01:14:15.884
IT'S NOT JUST.

01:14:15.951 --> 01:14:17.119
YOU KNOW PARTIAL BY PARCEL THAT

01:14:17.186 --> 01:14:19.087
IT'S ACTUALLY ENTIRE COMMUNITY

01:14:19.154 --> 01:14:21.557
THAT COULD BE INSURABLE AND

01:14:21.623 --> 01:14:23.358
MAYBE DRAW AT RISK A LITTLE DOWN

01:14:23.425 --> 01:14:24.793
WHICH WILL HOPEFULLY BRING THE

01:14:24.860 --> 01:14:26.094
PREMIUMS DOWN SO I KNOW FROM MY

01:14:26.161 --> 01:14:28.130
OWN EXPERIENCE OUR LOCAL FIRE

01:14:37.840 --> 01:14:38.974
WEALTH BUT THEY WILL CLEAR THE

01:14:39.041 --> 01:14:40.742
AREA AND IS THIS THE KIND OF

01:14:40.809 --> 01:14:41.577
THING YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT THAT

01:14:41.643 --> 01:14:42.611

01:16:26.081 --> 01:16:27.349
REQUESTED TO BE REGISTERED ARE

01:16:27.416 --> 01:16:30.652
YOU KEEP TRACK OF THAT AND AND

01:16:30.719 --> 01:16:32.020
OR DO WE HAVE A TREND LINE

01:16:32.087 --> 01:16:33.221
THAT'S GOING A CERTAIN DIRECTION

01:16:33.288 --> 01:16:34.790
WOULD TRACK THAT BUT I DON'T

01:16:34.856 --> 01:16:36.725

01:16:40.629 --> 01:16:41.763
FIRE INSURANCE.

01:16:41.830 --> 01:16:42.764
SO WE HAVE NOT SEEN ONE

01:16:42.831 --> 01:16:45.801
COMPANIES SAY THAT'S ENOUGH FOR

01:16:45.867 --> 01:16:48.070
LEAVING CALIFORNIA. TO MY

01:16:48.136 --> 01:16:50.105
KNOWLEDGE THAT IS CORRECT YOU'RE

01:16:50.172 --> 01:16:51.740
JUST HANGING ONE COMPANY DO THAT

01:16:51.807 --> 01:16:53.675
THEY'RE JUST SAYING WE WE DON'T

01:16:53.742 --> 01:16:54.242
WANT TO BE IN SANTA BARBARA

01:16:54.309 --> 01:16:56.111
ANYMORE.

01:16:56.178 --> 01:16:57.212
PARTS OF SANTA BARBARA POTENTIAL.

01:16:57.279 --> 01:16:58.447
AND I I SUSPECT PARTS OF ALL

01:16:58.513 --> 01:17:01.616
PLACES THERE WHERE THERE HAVE

01:17:01.683 --> 01:17:02.250
BEEN THE FIRES YEAH YEAH WITH

01:17:02.317 --> 01:17:04.219
THE THIS IS A UNIVERSAL PROBLEM

01:17:04.286 --> 01:17:06.021
AND AND THE WE'RE WE'RE SEEING

01:17:06.088 --> 01:17:06.521
REAL.

01:17:06.588 --> 01:17:08.357
CHALLENGE BECAUSE THE COSTS OF

01:17:08.423 --> 01:17:10.325
REINSURER THE COST OF INSURANCE

01:17:10.392 --> 01:17:11.293
EVEN IF THEY DO RENEW.

01:17:11.360 --> 01:17:13.395
CAN BE TRIPLE FOUR TIMES FIVE

01:17:13.462 --> 01:17:15.364
TIMES THE ORIGINAL COST AND FOR

01:17:15.430 --> 01:17:17.232
PEOPLE ON FIXED INCOMES.

01:17:17.299 --> 01:17:18.633
THAT BECOMES A BONE CRUSHER

01:17:18.700 --> 01:17:21.603
THANK THEY CAN'T DO IT SO.

01:17:21.670 --> 01:17:23.538
YOU KNOW THERE'S OBVIOUSLY WE

01:17:23.605 --> 01:17:24.706
DON'T WANT THE COMPANIES TO GO

01:17:24.773 --> 01:17:26.408
OUT OF BUSINESS BUT WE REALLY

01:17:26.475 --> 01:17:29.011
VERY VULNERABLE NOW AND AND THE

01:17:29.077 --> 01:17:31.113
THE FAIR PLAN DOES NOT.

01:17:31.179 --> 01:17:33.849

DIFFERENT WAYS OF PAYING -- FOR

01:17:53.502 --> 01:17:54.636
EITHER THE LIABILITY OF THE

01:17:54.703 --> 01:17:57.572
UTILITIES ARE OR THE HOMEOWNERS.

01:17:57.639 --> 01:17:58.507

01:18:06.314 --> 01:18:07.049
COVERED.

01:18:07.115 --> 01:18:08.683
FOR YET WE'RE HAVING

01:18:08.750 --> 01:18:10.619
CONVERSATIONS ABOUT.

YOU KNOW TAKING ON ADDITIONAL A

01:18:12.988 --> 01:18:17.125
FEE OR ATTACKS AND AND THAT JUST

01:18:17.192 --> 01:18:18.093
MAKES IT DIFFICULT FOR EVEN MORE

01:18:18.160 --> 01:18:19.694
DIFFICULT FOR FOLKS.

01:18:19.761 --> 01:18:20.562
THAT CURRENTLY ARE STILL UNDER

01:18:29.438 --> 01:18:32.240
A TREND OF COMPANIES LEAVING

01:18:32.307 --> 01:18:34.209
CALIFORNIA'S THAT'S THAT'S GOOD

01:18:34.276 --> 01:18:36.178
TO HEAR THE ISSUE IS.

01:18:36.244 --> 01:18:37.446
THEY'RE GETTING OUT A CERTAIN

01:18:37.512 --> 01:18:39.848
GEOGRAPHICAL ZONES OR MAYBE

01:18:39.915 --> 01:18:40.882
THEY'RE ASKING A MUCH HIGHER

01:18:40.949 --> 01:18:44.686
PREMIUM CORRECT SO -- AND IT IN

01:18:44.753 --> 01:18:45.787
FOLLOWING UP WITH WHAT YOU JUST

INSURANCE COMPANIES.

01:18:50.158 --> 01:18:52.194
WE'VE HAD PROP ONE OF THREE IN

01:18:52.260 --> 01:18:55.097
PLACE FOR THREE DECADES NOW.

01:18:55.163 --> 01:18:57.332
IS THE TIME TO LOOK AT MAYBE

01:18:57.399 --> 01:18:58.700
SOME MODIFICATIONS ARE YOU

01:18:58.767 --> 01:19:00.535
GETTING PUSHED BACK FROM THE

01:19:00.602 --> 01:19:01.803
INDUSTRY IS SAYS WHAT IF YOU HAD

01:19:01.870 --> 01:19:05.073
A MAGIC ONE YOU COULD FIX X. OR

01:19:05.140 --> 01:19:05.907
Y. OR Z..

01:19:05.974 --> 01:19:07.609
THAT WOULD MAKE THE MARKET MORE

01:19:07.676 --> 01:19:08.677
COMPETITIVE AND MAYBE PREMIUMS

01:19:08.743 --> 01:19:10.479
LOWER.

01:19:10.545 --> 01:19:13.215
WELL I MEAN I HAVE YET TO MEET

01:19:13.281 --> 01:19:15.217
ONE ENSURE WHO DOESN'T.

01:19:15.283 --> 01:19:17.986
WHO WHO LIKES PROP THIRTY ONE

01:19:18.053 --> 01:19:21.289
BUT -- I'LL TELL YOU IF IF.

01:19:21.356 --> 01:19:22.757
THEY WANT TO INCREASE THE RATES

01:19:22.824 --> 01:19:25.060
THERE'S A PROCESS FOR THAT

01:19:25.127 --> 01:19:26.027
WITHIN PROP ONE OF THREE WE'RE

01:19:26.094 --> 01:19:27.929
NOT STOPPING THAT FROM HAPPENING

01:19:27.996 --> 01:19:28.997
AND ACTUALLY SAID SEVERAL

01:19:29.064 --> 01:19:32.067
COMPANIES HAVE -- ARE UTILIZING

01:19:32.134 --> 01:19:33.401
THAT.

01:19:33.468 --> 01:19:35.470
PUBLIC PROCESS TO BE ABLE TO TO

01:19:35.537 --> 01:19:36.671
RAISE OUR RATES IT'S JUST A HAS

01:19:36.738 --> 01:19:38.206
A TENS OF HAVING TO GO THROUGH

01:19:38.273 --> 01:19:40.242
THIS PUBLIC PROCESS WHICH WE

01:19:40.308 --> 01:19:42.777
FEEL IS IMPORTANT TO MAINTAIN A

01:19:42.844 --> 01:19:44.346
FOR GUNNERY SOMEBODY'S RATES.

01:19:44.412 --> 01:19:46.281
BEYOND THE 7% SO THERE IS A

01:19:46.348 --> 01:19:48.049
PROCESS FOR FOLKS TO RAISE THE

01:19:48.116 --> 01:19:49.551
RATES CURRENTLY UNDER PROP ONE

01:19:49.618 --> 01:19:51.119
OF THREE WHICH WE FEEL IS

01:19:51.186 --> 01:19:53.855
IMPORTANT -- NOW THE THE THE

01:19:53.922 --> 01:19:58.727
CONVERSATION AROUND -- HOW DO WE

01:19:58.793 --> 01:20:00.529
CONTINUE A ROBUST MARKET AND

01:20:00.595 --> 01:20:01.630
HAVING THE YOU KNOW AS WE KNOW

01:20:01.696 --> 01:20:02.130
THE INSURANCE MARKET IN

01:20:02.197 --> 01:20:03.398
CALIFORNIA IS THE LARGEST IN THE

01:20:03.465 --> 01:20:05.567
COUNTRY WHICH GIVES THE FROM THE

01:20:05.634 --> 01:20:06.001
WAY?

01:20:06.067 --> 01:20:09.471
BUT WHAT EVER -- YOU KNOW IT'S

01:20:09.538 --> 01:20:10.939
LITERALLY LIKE A BALLOON WE'VE

01:20:11.006 --> 01:20:12.374
YOU SQUEEZE ONE WAY IT'S GONNA

01:20:12.440 --> 01:20:14.376
YOU KNOW IT'S EXPAND AND THE

01:20:14.442 --> 01:20:16.011
OTHER WAY AND WHO'S GONNA COVER.

01:20:16.077 --> 01:20:18.079
SOMEBODY'S GONNA ALWAYS PAY AND

01:20:18.146 --> 01:20:19.581
WE'RE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT AS A

01:20:19.648 --> 01:20:20.949
DEPARTMENT OURSELVES.

01:20:21.016 --> 01:20:22.217
HOW DO WE GET AHEAD OF THIS IS

01:20:22.284 --> 01:20:23.885
THIS IS WHERE WE KEEP GOING BACK

01:20:23.952 --> 01:20:25.253
TO MITIGATION?

01:20:25.320 --> 01:20:27.189
BECAUSE OF WE INCENTIVIZE

01:20:27.255 --> 01:20:27.956
COMMUNITIES TO DO THE RIGHT

01:20:28.023 --> 01:20:30.859
THING AT A REGIONAL LEVEL.

01:20:30.926 --> 01:20:33.662
A CREATES A A HOPEFULLY CREATES

01:20:33.728 --> 01:20:36.097

01:20:44.839 --> 01:20:46.107
TESTY WHEN YOU START FREAKING

01:20:46.174 --> 01:20:46.841

01:22:52.734 --> 01:22:54.869
SO WHEN WHEN I LOOKED AT LETTER

01:22:54.936 --> 01:22:57.205
THAT WAS SENT BY -- THE

01:22:57.272 --> 01:22:59.107
INSURANCE INDUSTRY RECALL.

01:22:59.174 --> 01:23:03.745
REGARDS -- TO THE REPORT --

01:23:03.812 --> 01:23:05.714
THERE IS SO.

01:23:05.780 --> 01:23:08.616
I STRUGGLE TO UNDERSTAND IT BUT

01:23:08.683 --> 01:23:10.285
THE REASON I'M ASKING QUESTIONS

01:23:10.352 --> 01:23:12.487
SO TRY TO UNDERSTAND WHAT KIND

01:23:12.554 --> 01:23:14.322
OF SYSTEM THAT WE HAVE -- UNDER

01:23:14.389 --> 01:23:17.926
OF THE REPORTS -- APPENDIX THREE

01:23:17.992 --> 01:23:19.594
THEY THEY MAY RESPOND TO SOME OF

01:23:19.661 --> 01:23:21.930
THE RECOMMENDATIONS

01:23:21.996 --> 01:23:23.365
RECOMMENDATION NUMBER.

01:23:23.431 --> 01:23:24.132
TWO IS THAT CALIFORNIA'S SHOULD

01:23:24.199 --> 01:23:26.534
PROVIDE PRESERVE ITS RISK BASED

01:23:26.601 --> 01:23:27.068
APPROACH TO PRICE IN HOME

01:23:27.135 --> 01:23:28.870
INSURANCE.

01:23:28.937 --> 01:23:29.971
AND THEY RESPOND.

01:23:30.038 --> 01:23:31.973
THAT CALIFORNIA THAT WE SHOULD

01:23:32.040 --> 01:23:34.209
CHANGE THAT SENT US TO SAY.

01:23:34.275 --> 01:23:36.044
THE CALIFORNIA SHOULD EMBRACE

01:23:36.111 --> 01:23:37.545
RISK BRACE PRICE INSURANCE AND

01:23:37.612 --> 01:23:39.347
SO THE QUESTION I HAVE IS DO WE

01:23:39.414 --> 01:23:40.648
HAVE.

01:23:40.715 --> 01:23:43.551
A RISK BASED APPROACH. TWO OF

01:23:43.618 --> 01:23:45.453
PRICE INSURANCE.

01:23:45.520 --> 01:23:47.222
YES -- THE RATE INCREASE WHY DID

01:23:47.288 --> 01:23:48.823
THEY SAY THAT WE DON'T.

01:23:48.890 --> 01:23:51.626
I THINK THEY WOULD ALWAYS LIKE

01:23:51.693 --> 01:23:54.095
MORE RATE TO I I GUESS BUT THAT

01:23:54.162 --> 01:23:55.997
THEY SEGMENT THE RATE SO THAT

01:23:56.064 --> 01:23:58.333
HIGHER WILD FIRE RISK AREAS.

01:23:58.400 --> 01:24:00.902
PAY SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER

01:24:00.969 --> 01:24:02.637
PREMIUMS SO THAT'S THE THAT'S

01:24:02.704 --> 01:24:04.572
WHAT THE END GAME I MEAN --

01:24:04.639 --> 01:24:06.007
THEY'RE IDENTIFYING.

01:24:06.074 --> 01:24:07.675
CALIFORNIA PUTS CAPS IN TERMS OF

01:24:07.742 --> 01:24:09.010
RATES RIGHT SO THROUGH YOUR

01:24:09.077 --> 01:24:12.347
OFFICE YOU DECIDE THIS IS WHAT'S.

01:24:12.414 --> 01:24:13.715
NOT NOT A CAP WHAT'S FAIR PRICE

01:24:13.782 --> 01:24:15.417
WE WOULD APPROVE WHATEVER IS

01:24:15.483 --> 01:24:18.086
ACTUALLY PROVEN TO BE THE

01:24:18.153 --> 01:24:19.421
NECESSARY RATE INCREASE.

01:24:19.487 --> 01:24:21.589
THEY CAN INCREASE BY AS MUCH AS

01:24:21.656 --> 01:24:24.225
THEY ARE ABLE TO JUSTIFY ACTUAR

01:24:24.292 --> 01:24:26.294
AND THEY WOULD BE LIKE TO BE

01:24:26.361 --> 01:24:27.829
LESS REGULATE IN THAT AREA IS

01:24:27.896 --> 01:24:29.798
THAT WHAT THAT IS ALL ABOUT I'M

01:24:29.864 --> 01:24:32.534
JUST TRYING TO UNDERSTAND WHAT

01:24:32.600 --> 01:24:34.002
THIS IS ABOUT OKAY.

01:24:34.068 --> 01:24:34.702
AND AND WITH THAT WOULD IN

01:24:34.769 --> 01:24:39.674
REGARDS -- TO POLICY LIMITS AND

01:24:39.741 --> 01:24:41.309
YOU KNOW OTHER OTHER OTHER OTHER

01:24:41.376 --> 01:24:43.077
RECOMMENDATIONS THEY'D LIKE TO

01:24:43.144 --> 01:24:44.446
BE ABLE TO SET THAT.

01:24:44.512 --> 01:24:46.114
IN TERMS OF AND SAY -- WILL PUT

01:24:46.181 --> 01:24:47.315
MORE MONEY INTO THIS

01:24:47.382 --> 01:24:47.615
[inaudible]

01:24:47.682 --> 01:24:51.085
OF I MEAN THE FAIR PLAN WAS

01:24:51.152 --> 01:24:52.887
BASICALLY ESTABLISHED BECAUSE WE

01:24:52.954 --> 01:24:54.489
COULDN'T ENSURE CERTAIN AREAS IS

01:24:54.556 --> 01:24:56.157
THAT A LACK OF INSURANCE IN

01:24:56.224 --> 01:24:58.092
THOSE AREAS SET BY THE FACT THAT

01:24:58.159 --> 01:24:59.861
WE WE TRY TO REGULATE.

01:24:59.928 --> 01:25:01.329
WHAT THE INSURANCE COMPANY KNOWS

01:25:01.396 --> 01:25:02.931
THE FAIR PLAN WHEN IT WENT INTO

01:25:02.997 --> 01:25:04.833
EFFECT WILL LONG BEFORE

01:25:04.899 --> 01:25:06.701
PROPOSITION ONE OF?

01:25:06.768 --> 01:25:08.536
THREE AND ARGUABLY WERE IN NOW

01:25:08.603 --> 01:25:10.138
THEY WERE HIGH RISK AREAS BUT

01:25:10.205 --> 01:25:13.007
ALSO AREAS THAT INSURERS SIMPLY

01:25:13.074 --> 01:25:14.576
CHOSE NOT TO WRITE.

01:25:14.642 --> 01:25:16.144
URBAN AREAS THAT THEY DID NOT

01:25:16.211 --> 01:25:18.413
KNOW RIGHT.

01:25:18.480 --> 01:25:19.681
URBAN AREAS THAT HAVE MAYBE LOW

01:25:19.747 --> 01:25:22.584
INCOME I KNOW I WAS RAISED IN A

01:25:22.650 --> 01:25:23.952
CALIFORNIA FOR THE FAIR PLAN

01:25:24.018 --> 01:25:25.286
NEIGHBORHOODS SO I KNOW WHAT

01:25:25.353 --> 01:25:26.421
THAT MEANS.

01:25:26.488 --> 01:25:28.623
BUT THE THE OTHER QUESTION IS

01:25:28.690 --> 01:25:30.825
REGARDING THE FAIR PLAN.

01:25:30.892 --> 01:25:32.994
AND STRENGTHENED UNIT -- THERE'S

01:25:33.061 --> 01:25:35.530
ALSO THEY MAKE A CASE FOR

01:25:35.597 --> 01:25:37.799
SUBSIDIZED IN THE FOR PLAN AS A

01:25:37.866 --> 01:25:39.234
FOR PLAN EVER BEEN SUBSIDIZED

01:25:39.300 --> 01:25:41.336
DOES IT REQUIRE SUBSIDY.

01:25:41.402 --> 01:25:43.471
AND IS IT UNDER FUNDED.

01:25:43.538 --> 01:25:45.006
OF I THINK WHEN THE A FAIR PLAN

01:25:45.073 --> 01:25:48.309
WAS INITIALLY CREATED IN SIR --

01:25:48.376 --> 01:25:51.079
IS MADE A CONTRIBUTION. TWO OF

01:25:51.145 --> 01:25:52.247
FUNDED.

01:25:52.313 --> 01:25:55.149
THEY ACTUALLY HAVE RECEIVED --

01:25:55.216 --> 01:25:56.818
DISTRIBUTIONS FROM THE FAIR PLAN

01:25:56.885 --> 01:25:59.754
OF PROFITS IN RECENT YEARS.

01:25:59.821 --> 01:26:01.723
HOWEVER I THE FAIR PLAN DID

01:26:01.789 --> 01:26:05.093
SUFFER SIGNIFICANT LOSSES IN TWO

01:26:05.159 --> 01:26:07.128
THOUSAND SEVENTEEN AND TWO

01:26:07.195 --> 01:26:07.896
THOUSAND EIGHTEEN I DON'T KNOW

01:26:07.962 --> 01:26:08.796
THAT THEY'VE HAD TO DO AN

01:26:08.863 --> 01:26:10.064
ASSESSMENT.

01:26:10.131 --> 01:26:11.599
BUT THE INSURERS ARE THE

01:26:11.666 --> 01:26:14.669
BACKSTOP IF THE FAIR PLAN WERE

01:26:14.736 --> 01:26:17.939
TO GO THROUGH ITS CAPITAL AND

01:26:18.006 --> 01:26:18.239
REINSURANCE.

01:26:18.306 --> 01:26:20.575
THANK.

01:26:20.642 --> 01:26:22.477
THANK YOU BOTH VERY MUCH

01:26:22.544 --> 01:26:23.645
COMMISSIONER THANK YOU THANK YOU

NUMBERS WE SHOULD BE A THANK YOU.

01:26:25.880 --> 01:26:27.949
HE NOW OUR FINAL -- PANELISTS IS

01:26:28.016 --> 01:26:29.717
PROFESSOR MICHAEL LARA THIS WAR

01:26:29.784 --> 01:26:31.352
WILL DISCUSS ISSUES CONCERNING

01:26:31.419 --> 01:26:32.887
COST RECOVERY AS WELL AS FIND

01:26:32.954 --> 01:26:34.589
CONCEPTS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

01:26:34.656 --> 01:26:35.857
PERTAINING.

01:26:35.924 --> 01:26:37.025
THE PAYMENT WHILE FAR RELATED

01:26:37.091 --> 01:26:39.394
CLAIMS WELL I WELCOME YOU --

01:26:39.460 --> 01:26:41.195
PROFESSOR LAURA I APOLOGIZE FOR

01:26:41.262 --> 01:26:42.997
THE SECOND TIME IN A ROW YOU'RE

THE LAST ONE ON THE YOU KNOW ON

01:26:44.933 --> 01:26:45.867
THE ORDER.

01:26:45.934 --> 01:26:47.969
IT'S CERTAINLY NOT THAT THAT IS --

01:26:48.036 --> 01:26:50.038
THE LEAST IMPORTANT BECAUSE ALL

01:26:50.104 --> 01:26:50.972
THESE ISSUES ARE INCREDIBLY

01:26:51.039 --> 01:26:54.609
IMPORTANT SO THANK YOU FOR YOUR

01:26:54.676 --> 01:26:56.244
GREAT WORK FOR BEING HERE.

01:26:56.311 --> 01:26:57.712
ALL.

01:26:57.779 --> 01:26:59.447
THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME -- AND I

01:26:59.514 --> 01:27:01.783
APOLOGIZE BUT CITY BETWEEN YOU

01:27:01.849 --> 01:27:03.918
AND A BIRTHDAY DINNER -- ORDERED

01:27:03.985 --> 01:27:12.760
OUT OF THE I'M IN A I'M IN A

01:27:12.827 --> 01:27:15.029
SPEECH TODAY -- PRIMARILY ABOUT

01:27:15.096 --> 01:27:17.599
THE SUB CHAPTER THAT -- CHAIR

01:27:17.665 --> 01:27:18.700
PETERMAN AND I WORKED ON

01:27:18.766 --> 01:27:20.702
TOGETHER -- BUT BEFORE I DO THAT

01:27:20.768 --> 01:27:22.203
I WANT TO JUST SECOND SOMETHING

01:27:22.270 --> 01:27:24.772
THAT BOTH -- CHAIR PETER MEN AND

01:27:24.839 --> 01:27:25.773
COMMISSIONER LARA HAVE

01:27:25.840 --> 01:27:26.741
EMPHASIZED AND I THINK THIS

01:27:26.808 --> 01:27:27.842
REALLY CAME OUT OF ALL THE

01:27:27.909 --> 01:27:29.310
TESTIMONY THAT WE HEARD.

01:27:29.377 --> 01:27:32.046
THE IMPORTANCE OF FULLY FUNDING

01:27:32.113 --> 01:27:34.782
AN INTENSIVE MEDICATION EFFORT

01:27:34.849 --> 01:27:35.917
IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA.

01:27:35.984 --> 01:27:38.386
I THINK CANNOT BE OVERSTATED --

01:27:38.453 --> 01:27:40.355
WE ARE CONTEMPLATING MULTI

01:27:40.421 --> 01:27:43.358
BILLION DOLLAR INVESTMENTS -- IN

01:27:43.424 --> 01:27:45.159
TERMS OF SOCIALIZING COSTS.

01:27:45.226 --> 01:27:49.263
AND I THINK THE THE WORK THAT

01:27:49.330 --> 01:27:51.599
THE DAY NINE A ONE COMMITTEE DID

01:27:51.666 --> 01:27:53.735
LAST YEAR TO REALLY RAMP UP OUR

01:27:53.801 --> 01:27:56.437
INVESTMENT AND WHILE FOR

01:27:56.504 --> 01:27:57.905
MEDICATION IS IS ADMIRABLE AND

01:27:57.972 --> 01:27:59.040
WE NEED TO KEEP GOING FURTHER

01:27:59.107 --> 01:27:59.874
THAN THAT.

01:27:59.941 --> 01:28:01.843
THERE'S SO MUCH TO BE DONE AND

01:28:01.909 --> 01:28:03.678
THERE THE PAYOFF TO MITIGATION

01:28:03.745 --> 01:28:07.415
IS NOT SOMETHING ON THE ORDER OF

01:28:07.482 --> 01:28:08.182
SIX TO ONE AND SO.

01:28:08.249 --> 01:28:09.384
IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE SHOULD BE

01:28:09.450 --> 01:28:11.552
LOOKING AT OPPORTUNITIES TO FOR

01:28:11.619 --> 01:28:13.755
INVESTMENT -- LOOKING AT THE

01:28:13.821 --> 01:28:15.456
COMMUNITY LEVEL.

01:28:15.523 --> 01:28:17.558
AND IN TERMS OF FUELS MANAGEMENT

01:28:17.625 --> 01:28:20.361
AND FUEL LOAD -- AND ALSO.

01:28:20.428 --> 01:28:21.629
AT THE INDIVIDUAL HOMEOWNER

01:28:21.696 --> 01:28:23.131
LEVEL IN TERMS OF HOME HARDENING

01:28:23.197 --> 01:28:26.901
AND DEFENSIBLE SPACE -- CHAU.

01:28:26.968 --> 01:28:29.303
I AM GONNA FOCUS BRIEFLY AND

01:28:29.370 --> 01:28:31.205
THEN -- HOPEFULLY LEAVE TIME FOR

01:28:31.272 --> 01:28:33.975
QUESTIONS ON OUR DISCUSSION THE

01:28:34.042 --> 01:28:36.411
OF A WILDFIRE FUND.

01:28:36.477 --> 01:28:39.747
AS AN OPTION AND ASSOCIATED.

01:28:39.814 --> 01:28:43.551
ASPECTS OF COST RECOVERY -- OUR

01:28:43.618 --> 01:28:45.353
COMMISSION -- ULTIMATELY

01:28:45.420 --> 01:28:47.155
RECOMMENDED THE CREATION OF WHAT

01:28:47.221 --> 01:28:48.956
WE CALL -- A WILDFIRE VICTIMS

01:28:49.023 --> 01:28:49.957
FUND [inaudible]

01:28:50.024 --> 01:28:53.628
AND I THINK THE BEST WAY TO

01:28:53.695 --> 01:28:56.130
THINK ABOUT THIS PROPOSAL IS AS

01:28:56.197 --> 01:28:57.231
SORT OF A SECOND INSURANCE

01:28:57.298 --> 01:29:00.334
POLICY [inaudible] FOR UTILITIES.

01:29:00.401 --> 01:29:02.537
THE CURRENT UTILITY LIABILITY

01:29:02.603 --> 01:29:04.439
COVERAGE IS ON THE ORDER OF A

01:29:04.505 --> 01:29:05.840
BILLION TO BILLION HALF DOLLARS

01:29:05.907 --> 01:29:07.208
THAT'S REALLY LIMITED BY

01:29:07.275 --> 01:29:08.976
CAPACITY IN GLOBAL MARKETS IN

01:29:09.043 --> 01:29:10.645
YOU KNOW WILLINGNESS TO INSURE.

01:29:10.712 --> 01:29:12.346
CALIFORNIA WILDFIRE RISK BELIEVE

01:29:12.413 --> 01:29:13.848
IT OR NOT IS PRETTY LIMITED AT

01:29:13.915 --> 01:29:14.982
THIS POINT.

01:29:15.049 --> 01:29:16.851
AND UTILITY STRUGGLE TO OBTAIN

01:29:16.918 --> 01:29:19.120
INSURANCE IS TO GIVE YOU A SENSE

01:29:19.187 --> 01:29:21.222
THAT INSURANCE TYPICALLY COSTS --

01:29:21.289 --> 01:29:22.657
THIRTY CENTS ON THE DOLLAR SO TO

01:29:22.724 --> 01:29:24.358
COVER A BILLION DOLLARS RIGHT

01:29:24.425 --> 01:29:26.627
NOW UTILITIES HAVE TO PAY ABOUT

01:29:26.694 --> 01:29:27.228
THREE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS

01:29:27.295 --> 01:29:28.563
PER YEAR.

01:29:28.629 --> 01:29:30.665
SO IT'S VERY EXPENSIVE INSURANCE

01:29:30.732 --> 01:29:31.566
THINK ABOUT IF YOUR HOMEOWNER'S

01:29:31.632 --> 01:29:34.769
POLICIES COST THAT MUCH RIGHT --

01:29:34.836 --> 01:29:37.171
SO.

01:29:37.238 --> 01:29:38.539
THE VICTIMS FIND WOULD SERVE AS

01:29:38.606 --> 01:29:40.775
KIND OF A SECONDARY INSURANCE

01:29:40.842 --> 01:29:43.144
POLICY IN A THE GOAL OF FAT IS

01:29:43.211 --> 01:29:45.480
REALLY TO PROTECT RATE PAYERS

01:29:45.546 --> 01:29:47.882
FROM WILDFIRE COSTS.

01:29:47.949 --> 01:29:50.318
AND TO CREATE GREATER CERTAINTY

01:29:50.384 --> 01:29:51.519
FOR VICTIMS THAT THEY WILL

01:29:51.586 --> 01:29:53.087
ACTUALLY GET PAID RATHER THAN

01:29:53.154 --> 01:29:55.089
SEEING THEIR CLAIMS SETTLED AND

01:29:55.156 --> 01:29:56.657
AND NOT PAID BECAUSE THE COMPANY

01:29:56.724 --> 01:29:58.159
ENTERED BANKRUPTCY OR DISCHARGED

01:29:58.226 --> 01:30:00.294
IN BANKRUPTCY AND PAID AT A MUCH

01:30:00.361 --> 01:30:03.998
DISCOUNTED RATE -- THERE

01:30:04.065 --> 01:30:07.502
ENORMOUS CHALLENGES -- TO

01:30:07.568 --> 01:30:08.770
EXECUTING ON THIS KIND OF A

01:30:08.836 --> 01:30:10.338
POLICY AND WE ARE.

01:30:10.404 --> 01:30:11.939
CLEAR ABOUT THEM IN THE REPORT

01:30:12.006 --> 01:30:13.574
AND I RECOMMEND THAT YOU THINK

01:30:13.641 --> 01:30:14.675
ABOUT THE POLICY PROPOSAL BUT

01:30:14.742 --> 01:30:16.477
ALSO READ OUR OUR DISCUSSION OF

01:30:16.544 --> 01:30:18.079
THE CHALLENGES AND I THINK THE

01:30:18.146 --> 01:30:19.080
BIGGEST CHALLENGE IS REALLY

01:30:19.147 --> 01:30:20.982
INVOLVED -- THEY NEED TO GET

01:30:21.048 --> 01:30:22.750
CONTRIBUTION [inaudible]

01:30:22.817 --> 01:30:25.520
SUBSTANTIAL CONTRIBUTION REALLY

01:30:25.586 --> 01:30:27.855
SHARED SACRIFICE -- FROM

01:30:27.922 --> 01:30:29.924
UTILITIES POTENTIALLY FROM OTHER

01:30:29.991 --> 01:30:32.994
PARTIES -- THERE ARE THERE IS

01:30:33.060 --> 01:30:35.329
PERHAPS SOME CLARITY ABOUT HOW

01:30:35.396 --> 01:30:37.765
AND IF THERE IS SOME SORT OF A

01:30:37.832 --> 01:30:39.300
FIND HOW RATE PAYERS MIGHT

01:30:39.367 --> 01:30:40.434
CONTRIBUTE TO THAT.

01:30:40.501 --> 01:30:42.970
BY EXTENSION OF THE CURRENTLY --

01:30:43.037 --> 01:30:45.173
IN FOR STATE IF YOU ARE BOND

01:30:45.239 --> 01:30:46.908
CHARGE -- THERE'S MUCH LESS

01:30:46.974 --> 01:30:49.210
CLARITY ABOUT HOW OTHER ACTORS

01:30:49.277 --> 01:30:50.545
THAT ARE.

01:30:50.611 --> 01:30:52.313
ACCOUNTABLE AND SHOULD BE HELD

01:30:52.380 --> 01:30:54.282
ACCOUNTABLE AND SHOULD SHARE IN

01:30:54.348 --> 01:30:57.018
THE COSTS OF THE DRAMATIC

01:30:57.084 --> 01:30:58.519
INCREASE RISKS THAT THE STATE IS

01:30:58.586 --> 01:30:59.954
CONFRONTING.

01:31:00.021 --> 01:31:00.822
SHOULD CONTRIBUTE AND THAT'S A

01:31:00.888 --> 01:31:03.291
THAT'S A KEY CHALLENGE SECONDARY

01:31:03.357 --> 01:31:04.659
CHALLENGER JUST MENTION BY.

01:31:04.725 --> 01:31:07.795
ARCHER PETERMAN IS THE ISSUE OF

01:31:07.862 --> 01:31:09.263
HOW.

01:31:09.330 --> 01:31:10.498
A COMPANY THAT IS IN BANKRUPTCY

01:31:10.565 --> 01:31:14.168
COULD CONTRIBUTE. TO FIND AND

01:31:14.235 --> 01:31:14.936
THEREFORE JOIN THE FUND.

01:31:15.002 --> 01:31:16.070
OBVIOUSLY THAT'S A BIG QUESTION

01:31:16.137 --> 01:31:18.239
FOR P. JEANNIE BUT I THINK THAT

01:31:18.306 --> 01:31:19.373
THERE ARE CREATIVE SOLUTIONS

01:31:19.440 --> 01:31:20.775
THAT ARE POSSIBLE.

01:31:20.842 --> 01:31:22.677
IF THERE IS LEADERSHIP SHOWN BY

01:31:22.743 --> 01:31:24.512
THE STATE A DIRECTION CHARTED BY

01:31:24.579 --> 01:31:25.513
THE STATE I THINK THERE'S THERE

01:31:25.580 --> 01:31:27.915
ARE POSSIBILITIES FOR OVERCOMING

01:31:27.982 --> 01:31:29.717
MATCH CHALLENGES WHILE -- I

01:31:29.784 --> 01:31:32.119
WOULD EMPHASIZE THAT.

01:31:32.186 --> 01:31:34.822
THIS KIND OF A PROPOSAL ALLOWS

01:31:34.889 --> 01:31:36.357
FOR RULES THAT WOULD REQUIRE.

01:31:36.424 --> 01:31:38.693
RE CAPITALIZATION TO THE FIND IF

01:31:38.759 --> 01:31:41.495
AND WHEN UTILITIES ARE IMPRUDENT

01:31:41.562 --> 01:31:42.563
OR NEGLIGENT.

01:31:42.630 --> 01:31:44.899
IN THERE ARE EITHER CONSTRUCTION

01:31:44.966 --> 01:31:46.300
MAINTENANCE OR OPERATION OF

01:31:46.367 --> 01:31:48.169
THEIR SYSTEM IF UTILITIES DO BAD

01:31:48.236 --> 01:31:50.104
THINGS THERE'S NO REASON THAT A

01:31:50.171 --> 01:31:53.174
FUNDS COULDN'T REQUIRE THEM. TO

01:31:53.241 --> 01:31:55.676
TO READ -- REPAY THE FUND FOR

01:31:55.743 --> 01:31:57.545
SOME FRACTION OF THE LOSSES --

01:31:57.612 --> 01:32:01.015
THE BENEFIT OF THIS SORT OF A

01:32:01.082 --> 01:32:03.251
FIND IS THAT IT WOULD ALLOW AS I

01:32:03.317 --> 01:32:05.152
SAID -- PROVIDE ESSENTIALLY LIKE

01:32:05.219 --> 01:32:09.090
A MOAT BETWEEN WILDFIRE COSTS

01:32:09.156 --> 01:32:10.324
AND RATE PAYERS THAT ARE ALREADY

01:32:10.391 --> 01:32:11.626
BURDENS.

01:32:11.692 --> 01:32:13.794
IT WOULD ALSO CREATE GREATER

01:32:13.861 --> 01:32:17.231
CERTAINTY THAT HE VICTIMS WILL

01:32:17.298 --> 01:32:18.766
ACTUALLY GET PAID AND GET PAID

01:32:18.833 --> 01:32:20.968
HOPEFULLY AT FASTER AND MORE

01:32:21.035 --> 01:32:24.238
TIMELY FASHION -- IT WOULD ALSO.

01:32:24.305 --> 01:32:27.541
INCREASE THE SOLVENCY AND REDUCE

01:32:27.608 --> 01:32:28.910
THE BANKRUPTCY RISK FOR THE

01:32:28.976 --> 01:32:31.045
UTILITIES WHICH HAS A SECONDARY

01:32:31.112 --> 01:32:33.047
IMPACT ON RATE PAYERS IN TERMS

01:32:33.114 --> 01:32:35.216
OF LOWER -- BORROWING COSTS

01:32:35.283 --> 01:32:36.951
ACOSTA CAPITAL GENERALLY FOR

01:32:37.018 --> 01:32:38.586
UTILITIES THE I. O. U.'S HAVE

01:32:38.653 --> 01:32:40.187
RECENTLY ASKED FOR A SIX HUNDRED

01:32:40.254 --> 01:32:41.789
BASIS POINT INCREASE.

01:32:41.856 --> 01:32:44.492
IN THEIR COST OF CAPITAL THAT IS --

01:32:44.558 --> 01:32:48.763
TO PUT IT MILDLY EXTRAORDINARY --

01:32:48.829 --> 01:32:50.965
AND ON AFFORDABLE FOR THE STATE

01:32:51.032 --> 01:32:52.266
I MEAN IT'S A SIMPLE AS THAT IF

01:32:52.333 --> 01:32:54.101
WE'RE GOING TO MAINTAIN A BEST

01:32:54.168 --> 01:32:55.536
IN CLASS ELECTRICITY

01:32:55.603 --> 01:32:56.737
INFRASTRUCTURE PARTICULARLY ONE

01:32:56.804 --> 01:32:58.072
THAT GETS CLEANER.

01:32:58.139 --> 01:32:59.540
OVERTIME AND DELIVERS ON OUR

01:32:59.607 --> 01:33:01.008
CLIMATE GOALS.

01:33:01.075 --> 01:33:04.845
WE CAN'T HAVE 1617% COSTS

01:33:04.912 --> 01:33:06.113
CAPITAL JUST DOESN'T I'M NOT

01:33:06.180 --> 01:33:07.148
CLEAR HOW THAT COULD WORK.

01:33:07.214 --> 01:33:08.983
SO.

01:33:09.050 --> 01:33:11.018
A LARGE UTILITY FUND WOULD HELP

01:33:11.085 --> 01:33:12.987
TO SOLVE THOSE ISSUES --

01:33:13.054 --> 01:33:16.991
IMPORTANTLY WE SUGGEST THAT.

01:33:17.058 --> 01:33:18.526
IT SHOULD NOT BE FOREVER.

01:33:18.592 --> 01:33:19.927
THIS IS THE KIND OF FIND THAT

01:33:19.994 --> 01:33:21.362
NEEDS TO EXISTS NOW IN THE

01:33:21.429 --> 01:33:23.965
PRESENT SITUATION BUT NEED NOT

01:33:24.031 --> 01:33:25.232
INDOOR INDEFINITELY.

01:33:25.299 --> 01:33:26.901
AND THAT WE WOULD RECOMMEND THAT

01:33:26.968 --> 01:33:27.935
ANY IF IF THE SORT OF AN

01:33:28.002 --> 01:33:30.338
APPROACH IS TAKEN OR OF ANY SORT

01:33:30.404 --> 01:33:31.372
OF A FUND IS CREATED THERE BE

01:33:31.439 --> 01:33:34.075
PERIODIC OFF RAMPS FOR

01:33:34.141 --> 01:33:36.677
CONSIDERATION -- THAT TO WIND

01:33:36.744 --> 01:33:38.045
DOWN THE FUND IF AND WHEN

01:33:38.112 --> 01:33:41.415
WILDFIRE RISKS ARE REDUCED AND

01:33:41.482 --> 01:33:43.017
WE CAN BE CONFIDENT THAT A VERY

01:33:43.084 --> 01:33:46.954
LARGE FUND IS NO LONGER REQUIRED --

01:33:47.021 --> 01:33:48.289
WE GO INTO SOME DETAIL IN THE

01:33:48.356 --> 01:33:49.690
REPORT ALSO ABOUT.

01:33:49.757 --> 01:33:51.759
THE CONSIDERATIONS ENTER INTO

01:33:51.826 --> 01:33:53.394
HOW BIG A FUND WE NEED.

01:33:53.461 --> 01:33:54.829
AND I THINK THAT THE REALITY IS

01:33:54.895 --> 01:33:55.896
THAT THE RISK MODELING IS

01:33:55.963 --> 01:33:57.331
UNCERTAIN.

01:33:57.398 --> 01:34:01.235
AND WE HAVE THERE ARE VARIOUS

01:34:01.302 --> 01:34:02.036
ESTIMATES THAT ARE OUT THERE IN

01:34:02.103 --> 01:34:04.405
THE IN THE DISCUSSION AROUND HOW

01:34:04.472 --> 01:34:05.706
BIG A FINE SHOULD BE I I DON'T

01:34:05.773 --> 01:34:06.507
REALLY NEED TO GET INTO THAT

01:34:06.574 --> 01:34:07.975
HERE BUT I CAN SPEAK TO THE THE

01:34:08.042 --> 01:34:11.379
FACTORS THAT MATTER IF YOU LIKE --

01:34:11.445 --> 01:34:14.048
I WANT TO ADDRESS IN SOME DETAIL.

01:34:14.115 --> 01:34:15.683
AN ALTERNATIVE SUGGESTION A

01:34:15.750 --> 01:34:17.084
SMALLER FUND THAT WE ALSO

01:34:17.151 --> 01:34:19.120
CONSIDERED AND THINK MAY HAVE

01:34:19.186 --> 01:34:22.089
SOME MERIT -- THIS IS TERMS IN

01:34:22.156 --> 01:34:24.091
THE DISCUSSION IN THE BUILDING A

01:34:24.158 --> 01:34:27.428
LIQUIDITY FUND -- AND I THINK IN

01:34:27.495 --> 01:34:28.329
CONTRAST TO THE SORT OF

01:34:28.396 --> 01:34:30.364
INSURANCE POLICY MODEL THE RIGHT

01:34:30.431 --> 01:34:31.599
WAY TO THINK ABOUT A LIQUIDITY

01:34:31.665 --> 01:34:33.334
FIND CONCEPTUALLY.

01:34:33.401 --> 01:34:34.068
THIS IS SORT OF LIKE A BRIDGE

01:34:34.135 --> 01:34:36.637
LOAN. FOR UTILITIES AND THE GOAL

01:34:36.704 --> 01:34:38.706
HERE WOULD BE TO PROVIDE MONEY

01:34:38.773 --> 01:34:40.474
TO THE UTILITIES AS SOON AS IT'S

01:34:40.541 --> 01:34:42.309
NEEDED TO PAY VICTIMS AFTER A

01:34:42.376 --> 01:34:44.578
BIG FIRE -- BUT TEND TO REQUIRE

01:34:44.645 --> 01:34:47.481
REPAYMENT OF THAT MONEY AT THE

01:34:47.548 --> 01:34:49.483
POINT WHERE A COST RECOVERY

01:34:49.550 --> 01:34:50.584
APPLICATION OCCURS.

01:34:50.651 --> 01:34:51.952
ANY IDEA.

01:34:52.019 --> 01:34:53.154
IN CONTRAST TO SORT OF THE

01:34:53.220 --> 01:34:55.856
SOLVENCY CREATING STABILITY --

01:34:55.923 --> 01:34:58.325
LONG TERM STABILITY GOAL OF THE

01:34:58.392 --> 01:35:00.027
THE VICTIMS FIND.

01:35:00.094 --> 01:35:01.796
THE GLOBAL EQUITY FIND IS TO

01:35:01.862 --> 01:35:03.264
PREVENT INVESTOR PANIC FROM

01:35:03.330 --> 01:35:04.999
GETTING OUT OF CONTROL AND

01:35:05.066 --> 01:35:05.966
LEADING TO A BANKRUPTCY AND

01:35:06.033 --> 01:35:07.902
CERTAINLY THERE WAS A BIT OF A

01:35:07.968 --> 01:35:10.237
PANIC -- PRIOR TO THE P. JEANNIE

01:35:10.304 --> 01:35:11.238
FILING P. JEANNIE WAS

01:35:11.305 --> 01:35:14.008
ESSENTIALLY ISOLATED FROM ALL OF

01:35:14.075 --> 01:35:15.543
ITS ACCESS TO CAPITAL BY ANY

01:35:15.609 --> 01:35:16.811
MEANS.

01:35:16.877 --> 01:35:18.412
AND FACED A CASH SQUEEZE AS ITS

01:35:18.479 --> 01:35:21.515
CREDITORS WERE ASKING FOR

01:35:21.582 --> 01:35:22.950
PAYMENT.

01:35:23.017 --> 01:35:24.518
PAYMENT OF OF LIABILITIES THAT

01:35:24.585 --> 01:35:25.286
MIGHT COME DUE AT THE END OF THE

01:35:25.352 --> 01:35:25.886
MONTH.

01:35:25.953 --> 01:35:27.721
SO A LIQUIDITY FINE WOULD

01:35:27.788 --> 01:35:28.923
ADDRESS THAT PROBLEM.

01:35:28.989 --> 01:35:30.424
AND WOULD HELP -- IN THE

01:35:30.491 --> 01:35:32.693
AFTERMATH OF A FIRE TO PREVENT

01:35:32.760 --> 01:35:35.229
KIND OF A INVESTOR ANXIETY FROM

01:35:35.296 --> 01:35:37.765
SPINNING OUT OF CONTROL -- IT

01:35:37.832 --> 01:35:40.434
WOULD NOT PREVENT A BANKRUPTCY

01:35:40.501 --> 01:35:42.136
IF THE LIABILITIES ARE IN FACT.

01:35:42.203 --> 01:35:43.471
FROM FIRE ARE IN FACT A BIGGER

01:35:43.537 --> 01:35:45.106
THAN THE ASSETS OF THE COMPANY

01:35:45.172 --> 01:35:47.074
RIGHT SO IT'LL PREVENT PANIC

01:35:47.141 --> 01:35:48.275
FROM GETTING OUT OF CONTROL IT

01:35:48.342 --> 01:35:49.410
WILL NOT PREVENT THE CALM AND

01:35:49.477 --> 01:35:50.978
REASONED INVESTOR WHO SORT OF

01:35:51.045 --> 01:35:53.581
WAYS THE ASSETS AND LIABILITIES

01:35:53.647 --> 01:35:55.583
AND LOOKS AT THE MAN SAYS THESE

01:35:55.649 --> 01:35:56.684
WILDFIRE LIFE IS ARE. TOO BIG.

01:35:56.750 --> 01:35:57.718
FROM WALKING AWAY FROM OUR

01:35:57.785 --> 01:35:58.352
UTILITIES.

01:35:58.419 --> 01:36:00.054
SO THAT'S THE I THINK THE

01:36:00.121 --> 01:36:03.023
CONTRAST -- THE BENEFIT OF A

01:36:03.090 --> 01:36:03.624
LIQUIDITY FUND IS A COULD BE

01:36:03.691 --> 01:36:04.592
SMALLER.

01:36:04.658 --> 01:36:05.893
RIGHT IT COULD BE SUBSTANTIALLY

01:36:05.960 --> 01:36:08.129
SMALLER THAN IS -- WOULD BE

01:36:08.195 --> 01:36:10.598
REQUIRED TO ACTUALLY PAY LAIMS

01:36:10.664 --> 01:36:14.602
AS AN INSURANCE POLICY WOULD DO.

01:36:14.668 --> 01:36:16.770
WE MAKE A ESSENTIALLY. TWO KINDS

01:36:16.837 --> 01:36:19.840
OF COST RECOVERY RECOMMENDATIONS

01:36:19.907 --> 01:36:20.674
ENSURE PETERMAN MENTION THEM I'M

01:36:20.741 --> 01:36:21.675
JUST GONNA FOR FRAME THEM

01:36:21.742 --> 01:36:23.944
BRIEFLY IN THE CONTEXT OF THIS

01:36:24.011 --> 01:36:25.479
FUND DISCUSSION -- WE MENTIONED

01:36:25.546 --> 01:36:27.047
SOME SMALL WHAT WE THINK OF A

01:36:27.114 --> 01:36:28.682
SMALLER MODIFICATIONS IS OURS

01:36:28.749 --> 01:36:31.385
FIRST AND SECOND COST RECOVERY

01:36:31.452 --> 01:36:34.121
RECOMMENDATIONS THE BURDEN SHIFT --

01:36:34.188 --> 01:36:35.890
TO A FOR MORE FOR LIKE STANDARD

01:36:35.956 --> 01:36:38.159
STANDARD OR AN OF EMPHASIS THAT.

01:36:38.225 --> 01:36:39.827
THE LEGISLATURE THE GOVERNOR

01:36:39.894 --> 01:36:42.229
COULD PLACE ON VARIOUS THOSE IN

01:36:42.296 --> 01:36:43.664
SB NINE A ONE COST RECOVERY

01:36:43.731 --> 01:36:45.833
FACTORS THAT IMPLICATE.

01:36:45.900 --> 01:36:49.003
THE CONTRIBUTION OF OTHER ACTORS.

01:36:49.069 --> 01:36:51.172
IN YES A SORT OF A LOT MAKING AN

01:36:51.238 --> 01:36:54.708
EXPLICIT -- REQUIREMENT TO TO

01:36:54.775 --> 01:36:57.111
EVALUATE THE THE CONTRIBUTION OF

01:36:57.178 --> 01:36:59.880
OTHER ACTORS TO THE SEVERITY OF

01:36:59.947 --> 01:37:01.081
A WILDFIRE THOSE ARE.

01:37:01.148 --> 01:37:04.318
TWO MORE MODEST MODIFICATIONS TO

01:37:04.385 --> 01:37:06.287
COST RECOVERY.

01:37:06.353 --> 01:37:06.887
WE THINK THOSE ARE APPROPRIATE

01:37:06.954 --> 01:37:09.123
IF THE UTILITIES ARE UNWILLING

01:37:09.190 --> 01:37:11.125
OR UNABLE TO COME TO THE TABLE

01:37:11.192 --> 01:37:12.693
WITH SIX SUBSTANTIAL

01:37:12.760 --> 01:37:14.228
CONTRIBUTIONS TO SOLVING THIS

01:37:14.295 --> 01:37:16.397
PROBLEM.

01:37:16.463 --> 01:37:21.001
IF ON THE OTHER HAND IF THEY CAN.

01:37:21.068 --> 01:37:22.469
FIND A WAY.

01:37:22.536 --> 01:37:24.104
TO TRULY PARTICIPATE IN -- IN

01:37:24.171 --> 01:37:25.606
THE SHARED SACRIFICE THAT WILL

01:37:25.673 --> 01:37:29.343
BE NECESSARY IN THAT -- TO TO TO

01:37:29.410 --> 01:37:31.312
STABILIZING THE SITUATION -- WE

01:37:31.378 --> 01:37:34.048
THINK THAT LARGER --

01:37:34.114 --> 01:37:35.449
MODIFICATIONS COST RECOVERY

01:37:35.516 --> 01:37:37.151
MIGHT BE JUSTIFIED ONE

01:37:37.218 --> 01:37:38.385
ALTERNATIVE WOULD BE SORT OF A

01:37:38.452 --> 01:37:41.188
PERMANENT STRESS TESTS SO -- AN

01:37:41.255 --> 01:37:42.623
APPLICATION OF THE NINE A ONE

01:37:42.690 --> 01:37:44.391
STRESS TEST WHICH ARE INVESTORS

01:37:44.458 --> 01:37:46.093
ARE BECOMING MORE FAMILIAR WITH

01:37:46.160 --> 01:37:48.295
AS THE PROCESS PLAYS OUT AT THE

01:37:48.362 --> 01:37:51.298
PC -- TO ON ON ON AN ONGOING

01:37:51.365 --> 01:37:53.601
BASIS MAKE THEIR PROS AND CONS

01:37:53.667 --> 01:37:56.070
TO THAT APPROACH -- ANOTHER

01:37:56.136 --> 01:37:57.538
ALTERNATIVE WOULD BE TO SIMPLY

01:37:57.605 --> 01:38:00.608
REQUIRE THAT IF THERE IS A FIRE --

01:38:00.674 --> 01:38:03.711
AND THE UTILITY IS RESPONSIBLE --

01:38:03.777 --> 01:38:05.279
OR IS IT FALLS I SHOULD SAY.

01:38:05.346 --> 01:38:06.313
THAT THE UTILITY SHOULD GIVE

01:38:06.380 --> 01:38:07.615
UPPER PERCENTAGE OF ITS MARKET

01:38:07.681 --> 01:38:10.017
CAPITALIZATION PRIOR TO DON THE

01:38:10.084 --> 01:38:11.719
DAY BEFORE THE FIRE RIGHTS OF

01:38:11.785 --> 01:38:12.453
THE CHILES WERE TEN BILLION

01:38:12.519 --> 01:38:13.554
DOLLARS.

01:38:13.621 --> 01:38:15.022
THE DAY BEFORE FIRE IT CAUSES A

01:38:15.089 --> 01:38:17.258
FIRE DUE TO IMPRUDENCE OR

01:38:17.324 --> 01:38:18.292
NEGLIGENCE.

01:38:18.359 --> 01:38:19.360
H. WHAT HAPPENS SAVE HAVE TO PAY

01:38:19.426 --> 01:38:21.295
20% OF ITS MARKET CAP TWO

01:38:21.362 --> 01:38:22.630
BILLION DOLLARS AND THAT'S IT

01:38:22.696 --> 01:38:23.297
THEN THE FUND WOULD PICK UP THE

01:38:23.364 --> 01:38:24.031
REST.

01:38:24.098 --> 01:38:25.933
THESE KINDS OF LARGE CHANGES TO

01:38:26.000 --> 01:38:28.369
COST RECOVERY ONLY MAKES SENSE

01:38:28.435 --> 01:38:30.337
IF THE STATE HAS CREATED THIS

01:38:30.404 --> 01:38:33.040
LARGE INSURANCE POLICY IN

01:38:33.107 --> 01:38:33.974
BETWEEN.

01:38:34.041 --> 01:38:38.412
WILDFIRE LIABILITY AND RATE

01:38:38.479 --> 01:38:39.647
PAYERS.

01:38:39.713 --> 01:38:42.249
RIGHT WITHOUT THAT BIG CHANGES

01:38:42.316 --> 01:38:43.117
TO COST RECOVERY MEANS THAT RATE

01:38:43.183 --> 01:38:43.717
PAYERS ARE MORE LIKELY TO PAY

01:38:43.784 --> 01:38:45.085
COSTS.

01:38:45.152 --> 01:38:46.620
I WOULD JUST ADD AND AND SECOND

01:38:46.687 --> 01:38:48.522
AND EXTEND ON AND AND SECOND

01:38:48.589 --> 01:38:49.690
SOMETHING THAT -- CHAIR PETERMAN

01:38:49.757 --> 01:38:52.126
SAID -- IN HER REMARKS WHICH IS

01:38:52.192 --> 01:38:53.994
THAT WE ALSO EMPHASIZE.

01:38:54.061 --> 01:38:55.863
FINES FANTASY PC ENFORCEMENT

01:38:55.929 --> 01:38:58.332
AUTHORITY IS IMPORTANT I THINK

01:38:58.399 --> 01:38:59.366
TO THE DEGREE THAT WE ARE

01:38:59.433 --> 01:39:00.934
OFFERING ASSISTANCE TO THE

01:39:01.001 --> 01:39:02.736
UTILITIES WE SHOULD EMPHASIZE

01:39:02.803 --> 01:39:04.371
THOSE ISUES AND PERHAPS ALSO

01:39:04.438 --> 01:39:06.807
CONSIDER HOW TO MAKE MANAGEMENT

01:39:06.874 --> 01:39:08.442
OF I'LL USE MORE ACCOUNTABLE. TO

01:39:08.509 --> 01:39:10.577
DISTINGUISH BETWEEN SHAREHOLDERS

01:39:10.644 --> 01:39:13.580
AND THE MANAGEMENT OF THE

01:39:13.647 --> 01:39:13.847
UTILITIES.

01:39:13.914 --> 01:39:17.217
AND AS WE ARE EXTENDING HELP WE

01:39:17.284 --> 01:39:19.653
CAN ALSO ASK FOR VARIOUS THINGS

01:39:19.720 --> 01:39:23.057
IN RETURN -- AND BE HAPPY TO

01:39:23.123 --> 01:39:23.691
RESPOND TO QUESTIONS ON THAT IF

01:39:23.757 --> 01:39:25.225
YOU'RE INTERESTED.

01:39:25.292 --> 01:39:36.637
THANK YOU VERY MUCH. FOR PRESS I

01:39:36.704 --> 01:39:40.607
WANT TO THANK YOU FOR THE FOURTH.

01:39:40.674 --> 01:39:42.042
IN SOME INTERESTING CHALLENGES

01:39:42.109 --> 01:39:43.977
I'D LIKE.

01:39:44.044 --> 01:39:45.412
TO EMPHASIZE THAT WAS GOING TO

01:39:45.479 --> 01:39:47.681
TRY TO BRING THIS UP AT THE END

01:39:47.748 --> 01:39:48.248
BECAUSE I DON'T THINK WE'VE

01:39:48.315 --> 01:39:49.316
TALKED ABOUT IT.

01:39:49.383 --> 01:39:50.217
QUITE ENOUGH IN THIS HEARING SO

01:39:50.284 --> 01:39:52.286
FAR.

01:39:52.353 --> 01:39:53.253
YOU TALKED ABOUT WHILE FIRE

01:39:53.320 --> 01:39:55.089
MITIGATION.

01:39:55.155 --> 01:39:56.523
AND FUEL LOAD AND FUEL

01:39:56.590 --> 01:39:58.759
MANAGEMENT.

01:39:58.826 --> 01:40:01.528
CANDIDLY OVER DECADES AND I'VE

01:40:01.595 --> 01:40:04.531
BEENENGAGED IN THIS FOR DECADES.

01:40:04.598 --> 01:40:05.466
PART OF OUR PROBLEM IN

01:40:05.532 --> 01:40:06.333
CALIFORNIA HAS BEEN IN THE

01:40:06.400 --> 01:40:08.435
TENSION.

01:40:08.502 --> 01:40:11.238
OR PURPOSEFUL NEGLECT OF FORCED

01:40:11.305 --> 01:40:12.339
IN WILD LANDS.

01:40:12.406 --> 01:40:14.274
MANAGING.

01:40:14.341 --> 01:40:15.509
RATHER THAN LEAVE ME ALONE AND

01:40:15.576 --> 01:40:16.844
THAT'S BEEN OF STATE.

01:40:16.910 --> 01:40:17.277
LOCAL.

01:40:17.344 --> 01:40:19.146
AND FEDERAL [inaudible]

01:40:19.213 --> 01:40:21.849
FORMS.

01:40:21.915 --> 01:40:22.750
A LOT OF IT'S BEEN DONE

01:40:22.816 --> 01:40:25.919
STATUTORY AND REGULATORY.

01:40:25.986 --> 01:40:27.788
BUT IT IS DE TOURED [inaudible]

01:40:27.855 --> 01:40:31.425
THE OR DISMANTLED IF YOU WILL

01:40:31.492 --> 01:40:33.427
SOME OF THE INFRASTRUCTURE THAT

01:40:33.494 --> 01:40:37.498
WE HAVE USED. TO REMOVE FUEL.

01:40:37.564 --> 01:40:40.467
CO GENERATION FACILITIES

01:40:40.534 --> 01:40:40.768
[inaudible]

01:40:40.834 --> 01:40:42.669
MALES.

01:40:42.736 --> 01:40:44.171
RIGHT NOW THE PARADISE WE'RE

01:40:44.238 --> 01:40:45.839
PILING UP LOGS BECAUSE WE DON'T

01:40:45.906 --> 01:40:49.376
HAVE A PLACE TO TAKE A THAT'S

01:40:49.443 --> 01:40:51.378
GOT TO BE A PART OF THE FUTURE.

01:40:51.445 --> 01:40:53.247
AND PART OF THAT FUTURE HAS GOT

01:40:53.313 --> 01:40:55.416
TO BE THE REGULATORY SCHEME.

01:40:55.482 --> 01:40:57.785
THE STATE.

01:40:57.851 --> 01:40:59.753
AND LOCAL LEVEL [inaudible]

01:40:59.820 --> 01:41:02.623
I ALSO.

01:41:02.689 --> 01:41:03.157
LIKE YOUR IDEA.

01:41:03.223 --> 01:41:05.592
AND THIS IS.

01:41:05.659 --> 01:41:08.562
KIND OF UNHEARD OF AROUND HERE.

01:41:08.629 --> 01:41:10.497
IF YOU TALK ABOUT THIS

01:41:10.564 --> 01:41:10.798
[inaudible]

01:41:10.864 --> 01:41:11.632
LIQUIDITY [inaudible]

01:41:11.698 --> 01:41:13.467
FUN.

01:41:13.534 --> 01:41:15.669
BUT WHAT YOU SAID.

01:41:15.736 --> 01:41:17.504
WAS IT SHOULD NOT BE.

01:41:17.571 --> 01:41:19.706
AN INFINITY.

01:41:19.773 --> 01:41:21.708
MOST THINGS WE CREATE

01:41:21.775 --> 01:41:23.410
LEGISLATIVELY OR FOREVER YOU

01:41:23.477 --> 01:41:26.246
NEVER GET RID OF I LOVE YOUR

01:41:26.313 --> 01:41:29.283
POINT ABOUT THE OFF RAMP.

01:41:29.349 --> 01:41:31.618
THAT SOMETHING WILL HAVE A

01:41:31.685 --> 01:41:33.821
PROSPECT OF TERMINATION.

01:41:33.887 --> 01:41:36.623
THAT'S A VERY SIGNIFICANT

01:41:36.690 --> 01:41:37.825
DEPARTURE FROM WHERE WE'VE BEEN.

01:41:37.891 --> 01:41:39.726
BUT I THINK INCORPORATING THAT

01:41:39.793 --> 01:41:41.528
INTO SOME OF OUR DIALOGUE AND

01:41:41.595 --> 01:41:43.497
MAYBE END OF TERMS OF POLICY.

01:41:43.564 --> 01:41:46.400
MIGHT BE VERY HELPFUL.

01:41:46.467 --> 01:41:48.869
COULD YOU EXPAND -- JUST A

01:41:48.936 --> 01:41:50.070
MOMENT THEN ON WHERE YOU WOULD

01:41:50.137 --> 01:41:52.506
SEE CALIFORNIA GOING NEXT.

01:41:52.573 --> 01:41:54.808
IN TERMS OF CREATING THE

01:41:54.875 --> 01:41:56.777
INFRASTRUCTURE FOR MANAGING THE

01:41:56.844 --> 01:41:58.912
FEELS ON THE FORCE.

01:41:58.979 --> 01:42:02.850
AND THE WILD LANDS.

01:42:02.916 --> 01:42:06.687
YES SO ON THE ON THE ON THE ON

01:42:06.753 --> 01:42:07.788
THAT WHAT I WOULD CALL THE

01:42:07.855 --> 01:42:09.890
MITIGATION A RISK REDUCTION SIDE

01:42:09.957 --> 01:42:12.493
RESIDES I THINK THE I WOULD

01:42:12.559 --> 01:42:13.894
ARGUE THAT.

01:42:13.961 --> 01:42:16.663
THERE ARE SORT OF THREE MAJOR

01:42:16.730 --> 01:42:19.466
COMPONENTS ONE IS.

01:42:19.533 --> 01:42:23.337
OUR FUELS MANAGEMENT IN WILD

01:42:23.403 --> 01:42:24.471
ONCE IN TRUE WILD LANDS.

01:42:24.538 --> 01:42:25.539
AND DAD YOU KNOW THERE ARE

01:42:25.606 --> 01:42:28.542
CERTAINLY FIRES THAT START IN IN --

01:42:28.609 --> 01:42:29.810
TRULY.

01:42:29.877 --> 01:42:31.778
IN A WHILE LET AREAS AND THEN

01:42:31.845 --> 01:42:33.881
BURN INTO COMMUNITIES -- AND

01:42:33.947 --> 01:42:35.415
BETTER FUELS MANAGEMENT THERE

01:42:35.482 --> 01:42:37.918
REQUIRES GREATER APPLICATION

01:42:37.985 --> 01:42:40.487
PRESCRIBED BURNS -- SOME DEGREE

01:42:40.554 --> 01:42:42.289
MECHANICAL THINNING -- AND WE

01:42:42.356 --> 01:42:44.925
ARE FAR SHORT OF THE GOALS THAT

01:42:44.992 --> 01:42:46.326
ARE HAVE BEEN ARTICULATED BY THE

01:42:46.393 --> 01:42:48.161
STATE AND CERTAINLY THE FEDERAL

01:42:48.228 --> 01:42:48.829
GOVERNMENT IS FAR SHORT OF THEIR

01:42:48.896 --> 01:42:49.563
GOALS.

01:42:49.630 --> 01:42:53.066
IN TERMS OF TREATMENT OF ACREAGE.

01:42:53.133 --> 01:42:56.737
OF WILD LANDS I WOULD ARGUE.

01:42:56.803 --> 01:42:57.738
MORE IMPORTANT THAN THAT RIGHT

01:42:57.804 --> 01:42:59.673
NOW IF WE HAVE TO PRIORITIZE

01:42:59.740 --> 01:42:59.907
THOUGH.

01:42:59.973 --> 01:43:01.642
IS.

01:43:01.708 --> 01:43:03.110
MANAGEMENT AT THE COMMUNITY

01:43:03.176 --> 01:43:04.845
LEVEL FOCUSING ON WHERE PEOPLE

01:43:04.912 --> 01:43:06.647
LIVE AND IT'S ESPECIALLY AS WE

01:43:06.713 --> 01:43:07.881
CAN'T THINK ABOUT THE INSURANCE

01:43:07.948 --> 01:43:09.716
CHALLENGE WHERE THERE IS VALUE

01:43:09.783 --> 01:43:12.753
AT RISK -- REDUCING FUEL LOADS

01:43:12.819 --> 01:43:15.322
IN COMMUNITIES IS IS CRITICAL.

01:43:15.389 --> 01:43:17.791
I HAPPEN TO LIVE IN A IN MARIN

01:43:17.858 --> 01:43:19.660
COUNTY -- WHERE YOU KNOW

01:43:19.726 --> 01:43:21.895
HISTORICALLY FUEL LOADS -- PRIOR

01:43:21.962 --> 01:43:23.096
SETTLEMENT MORE ON THE ORDER OF

01:43:23.163 --> 01:43:24.798
TWENTY TONS PER ACRE NOW THEY'RE

01:43:24.865 --> 01:43:26.199
ON THE ORDER OF A HUNDRED TWENTY

01:43:26.266 --> 01:43:27.467
TIMES BREAKER IN MANY PARTS OF

01:43:27.534 --> 01:43:28.735
MARIN COUNTY.

01:43:28.802 --> 01:43:29.803
THAT'S A TIME BOMB.

01:43:29.870 --> 01:43:31.471
AND IT'S A TIME BOMB WHERE THERE

01:43:31.538 --> 01:43:33.707
ARE MANY MANY PEOPLE LIVING WITH

01:43:33.774 --> 01:43:35.309
INADEQUATE INGRESS AND EGRESS.

01:43:35.375 --> 01:43:36.777
AND THAT'S THE KIND OF THING

01:43:36.843 --> 01:43:38.078
THAT NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED AND

01:43:38.145 --> 01:43:39.980
AND IT'S A HUGE PROBLEM.

01:43:40.047 --> 01:43:42.249
IT'S NOT JUST COASTAL CALIFORNIA

01:43:42.316 --> 01:43:44.051
IT'S ALSO IN THE SIERRA NEVADA.

01:43:44.117 --> 01:43:46.787
AND I THINK THAT IS THE SECOND

01:43:46.853 --> 01:43:48.455
SILO IN THE THIRD SILOS WE NEED

01:43:48.522 --> 01:43:48.922
TO HER.

01:43:48.989 --> 01:43:51.258
HARDEN HOMES AND HAVE A WAY TO

01:43:51.325 --> 01:43:53.594
HELP LOW INCOME AND FIXED INCOME

01:43:53.660 --> 01:43:55.996
RESIDENTS A CALIFORNIA FINANCE

01:43:56.063 --> 01:43:57.731
HARDENING OF THEIR HOMES -- IN A

01:43:57.798 --> 01:43:59.099
IN A WAY THAT CAN WORK FOR THEM

01:43:59.166 --> 01:44:03.003
SO THAT THEY ARE SAFER IN A FIRE.

01:44:03.070 --> 01:44:04.271
WELL AT LEAST WE'RE TALKING MORE

01:44:04.338 --> 01:44:05.339
ABOUT IT NOW THEN YOU

01:44:05.405 --> 01:44:06.807
SPECIFICALLY HAVE AND I WANT TO

01:44:06.873 --> 01:44:09.076
THANK YOU FOR THAT.

01:44:09.142 --> 01:44:10.677
THE SENTENCE THANK YOU SENATOR

01:44:10.744 --> 01:44:11.912
CENTER HERTZBERG.

01:44:11.979 --> 01:44:12.546
THANK YOU VERY MUCH I WANT TO

01:44:12.613 --> 01:44:13.447
ADDRESS THREE THINGS THAT YOU

01:44:13.513 --> 01:44:15.349
TALKED ABOUT.

LONG.

01:44:21.121 --> 01:44:22.155
OUR JULY EACH ONE OF THOSE

01:44:22.222 --> 01:44:23.757
POINTS A LITTLE BIT MORE DEEPLY

01:44:23.824 --> 01:44:24.958
IN TERMS OF GIVING US GUIDES OF

01:44:25.025 --> 01:44:26.259
HOW WE SHOULD PROCEED.

01:44:26.326 --> 01:44:27.928
HE SAID THAT YOU SAW THE

01:44:27.995 --> 01:44:29.162
OBVIOUSLY WE KNOW THAT THEIR

01:44:29.229 --> 01:44:30.998
SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGES BACK TO

01:44:31.064 --> 01:44:32.132
THE CHAPTER PROCEEDING.

OVERCOME THE CHALLENGES

01:44:40.707 --> 01:44:42.442
ASSOCIATED WITH THE BANKRUPTCY

01:44:42.509 --> 01:44:44.177
IN TRYING TO PUT TOGETHER.

01:44:44.244 --> 01:44:46.079
A SOLUTION IN THE NEAR TERM

01:44:46.146 --> 01:44:47.247
WE'VE GOT THE ALL THE REASONS

01:44:47.314 --> 01:44:48.649

HERTZBERG -- WITH RESPECT TO

01:44:59.893 --> 01:45:01.728
BANKRUPTCY I THINK THAT -- WE

01:45:01.795 --> 01:45:02.996
ARE SEEING DIFFERENT --

01:45:03.063 --> 01:45:03.930
COMMITTEES WITHIN THE BANKRUPTCY

01:45:03.997 --> 01:45:05.232
EMERGE WITH SORT OF INTERESTING

01:45:05.298 --> 01:45:06.266
IDEAS.

01:45:06.333 --> 01:45:10.604
ARE AND THE SENATE -- AND THE

01:45:10.671 --> 01:45:12.139
GOVERNOR'S OFFICE -- I THINK

01:45:12.205 --> 01:45:14.141
WOULD BENEFIT FROM UNDERSTANDING

01:45:14.207 --> 01:45:16.476
THOSE IDEAS VETTING MA'AM.

01:45:16.543 --> 01:45:20.013
ARM AND AND IDEALLY.

01:45:20.080 --> 01:45:21.281
YOU KNOW IN IN A BANKRUPTCY

01:45:21.348 --> 01:45:24.084
PROCESS YOU HAVE COMPETITION

01:45:24.151 --> 01:45:24.651
RIGHT YOU SEXUALLY HAVE AN

01:45:24.718 --> 01:45:27.721
AUCTION TO CREATE.

01:45:27.788 --> 01:45:29.690
THE GREATEST ENTERPRISE VALUE

01:45:29.756 --> 01:45:31.091
WITH THE THAT THAT'S POSSIBLE

01:45:31.158 --> 01:45:32.292
FROM THE COMPANY SO THAT

01:45:32.359 --> 01:45:33.627
EVERYONE WHO'S A CLAIMANT GETS

01:45:33.694 --> 01:45:35.929
PAID AS MUCH MONEY AS POSSIBLE.

01:45:35.996 --> 01:45:37.197
AND I THINK WE'RE SEEING THAT

01:45:37.264 --> 01:45:39.633
SORT OF A PROCESS START TO

01:45:39.700 --> 01:45:41.168
EMERGE I THINK JUDGMENT HOLLY.

01:45:41.234 --> 01:45:42.402
IS.

01:45:42.469 --> 01:45:46.306
ATTENTIVE TO THAT EMERGENCE AND

01:45:46.373 --> 01:45:49.309
THE STATE -- CAN DO MUCH TO

01:45:49.376 --> 01:45:51.545
ENCOURAGE IT BY SIGNALING ITS

01:45:51.611 --> 01:45:53.814
INTEREST AND AND AND AND

01:45:53.880 --> 01:45:56.116
SIGNALING THAT IT IS INTEREST

01:45:56.183 --> 01:45:58.585
INTERESTED IN HEARING OFFERS.

01:45:58.652 --> 01:45:59.619
BUT CAN I JUST DILLON SETTLED

01:45:59.686 --> 01:46:00.620
WITH MORE YES YOU KNOW WE HAVE

01:46:00.687 --> 01:46:01.655
LIMITED TOOLS WE GET A BUDGET

01:46:01.722 --> 01:46:04.124
REQUEST WE CAN WE CAN AND SPEND

01:46:04.191 --> 01:46:05.959
MONEY WE CAN DRAFT LEGISLATION

01:46:06.026 --> 01:46:07.461
IN ORDER TO SOLVE.

01:46:07.527 --> 01:46:09.162
HERE WE ARE IF YOU IN FACT HAVE

01:46:09.229 --> 01:46:10.831
A NUMBER OF COMMITTEES OF IDEAS

01:46:10.897 --> 01:46:12.132
AND YOU CAN CREATE ENTERPRISE

01:46:12.199 --> 01:46:14.201
VALUE ALL OF WHICH ARE FANTASTIC

01:46:14.267 --> 01:46:15.502
AND I DO THINK THERE'S

01:46:15.569 --> 01:46:16.436
OPPORTUNITIES THERE.

01:46:16.503 --> 01:46:17.871
BUT IN YOUR JUDGMENT IF YOU JUST

01:46:17.938 --> 01:46:19.072
GIVE US A LITTLE BIT MORE OF

01:46:19.139 --> 01:46:20.540
YOUR THINKING ABOUT HOW TO YOU

01:46:20.607 --> 01:46:22.843
DRILL INTO THAT HE CAN'T ADOPT A

01:46:22.909 --> 01:46:23.944
PARTICULAR PLAN.

01:46:24.010 --> 01:46:25.612
CERTAINLY WE WANT AS AS

01:46:25.679 --> 01:46:26.980
PROTECTING THE PUBLIC IS

01:46:27.047 --> 01:46:28.381
PROTECTING RATE PAYERS AND

01:46:28.448 --> 01:46:29.983
TAXPAYERS AND EVERYBODY ELSE.

01:46:30.050 --> 01:46:31.518
THE MOST INTELLIGENT PLAN GOING

01:46:31.585 --> 01:46:33.920
FORWARD HOW WOULD YOU SUGGEST WE

01:46:33.987 --> 01:46:36.056
PROCEED THAT GIVES US THE BEST

01:46:36.123 --> 01:46:36.823
BENEFIT.

01:46:36.890 --> 01:46:39.559
IN THE INTRIGUE OF HOW

01:46:39.626 --> 01:46:41.528
BANKRUPTCY COURTS WORK STILL

01:46:41.595 --> 01:46:43.497
BOUND BY WHAT THE RATING

01:46:43.563 --> 01:46:50.203
AGENCIES HAVE IMPOSED UPON US.

01:46:50.270 --> 01:46:51.738
SO I I YOU KNOW I THINK ONE

01:46:51.805 --> 01:46:52.773
APPROACH.

01:46:52.839 --> 01:46:53.507
MIGHT BE TO IMPOSE

01:46:53.573 --> 01:46:54.608
CONDITIONALITY RIGHT SET OUT

01:46:54.674 --> 01:46:56.143
WHAT THE STATE WOULD LIKE MAKE

01:46:56.209 --> 01:46:57.911
SURE THAT IT'S VETTED AND

01:46:57.978 --> 01:47:02.616
REASONABLE -- AND THEN -- ALLOW

01:47:02.682 --> 01:47:04.584
P. JEANNIE THE OPPORTUNITY TO

01:47:04.651 --> 01:47:08.822
PARTICIPATE IN A PROGRAM THAT

01:47:08.889 --> 01:47:10.624
WILL HELP TO STABILIZE IT.

01:47:10.690 --> 01:47:13.393
IF IT SO CHOOSES AND THEN LEAVE

01:47:13.460 --> 01:47:15.328
IT TO THE BANKRUPTCY

01:47:15.395 --> 01:47:17.264
PARTICIPANTS TO FIGURE OUT HOW

01:47:17.330 --> 01:47:18.598
TO ENABLE THAT PARTICIPATION IN

01:47:18.665 --> 01:47:20.433
THAT BUT YOU WOULD SEE WITH IF

01:47:20.500 --> 01:47:21.668
IT HAPPENED WITH THE HUNDRED AND

01:47:21.735 --> 01:47:22.769
EIGHTY DAYS WERE P. G. IN THE

01:47:22.836 --> 01:47:25.305
STILL HAD CONTROL OVER IT'S A

01:47:25.372 --> 01:47:26.740
IT'S A PLAN.

01:47:26.807 --> 01:47:28.675
THAT IF IN FACT WEEK PROVIDE

01:47:28.742 --> 01:47:29.843
THAT LEVEL OF GUIDANCE YOU COULD

01:47:29.910 --> 01:47:32.879
SEE THAT IN THE P. JEANNIE PLAN

01:47:32.946 --> 01:47:34.147
WITH JUDGE MOUNT HOLLY NOW.

01:47:34.214 --> 01:47:37.250
YES AND I THINK IF P. JEANNIE --

01:47:37.317 --> 01:47:38.718
MANAGEMENT DID NOT COME FORWARD

01:47:38.785 --> 01:47:40.153
WITH A PLAN THAT ALLOWED IT TO

01:47:40.220 --> 01:47:41.321
PARTICIPATE SOMEBODY ELSE WOULD

01:47:41.388 --> 01:47:43.089
A MALE AND JUDGMENT TALLY WOULD

01:47:43.156 --> 01:47:45.892
ALLOW THAT PLAN -- TO PROCEED

01:47:45.959 --> 01:47:46.693
AND WOOD WOOD WOOD BUT

01:47:46.760 --> 01:47:49.596
PREMATURELY AND THE EXCLUSIVE

01:47:49.663 --> 01:47:51.731
EXCLUSIVITY PERIOD AND SECONDLY

01:47:51.798 --> 01:47:52.999
WITH RESPECT TO MITIGATION YOU

01:47:53.066 --> 01:47:54.167
SAID SOMETHING CAUGHT MY

01:47:54.234 --> 01:47:56.837
ATTENTION. SIX TO ONE SIX TWO

01:47:56.903 --> 01:47:58.371
ONE THE LAST HEARING WE HAD FROM

01:47:58.438 --> 01:48:00.207
THE GOVERNOR'S TEAM WE WE SAW

01:48:00.273 --> 01:48:01.975
ONE CHART THAT SHOWED VERY

01:48:02.042 --> 01:48:03.743
LIMITED IMPACT.

01:48:03.810 --> 01:48:04.811
YOU KNOW AYE AYES FEATURE OF

01:48:04.878 --> 01:48:05.879
NATURAL RESOURCES AND WON THE

01:48:05.946 --> 01:48:07.247
FIRST FEELS LIKE HEARINGS I HELD

01:48:07.314 --> 01:48:08.615
WAS CLEARING THE HUNDRED AND

01:48:08.682 --> 01:48:10.817
THIRTY MILLION TREES BUT JUSTICE.

01:48:10.884 --> 01:48:12.319
CENTER NIELSEN SAYS THERE WASN'T

01:48:12.385 --> 01:48:16.389
A LOT OF INTEREST IN THE BUDGET

01:48:16.456 --> 01:48:16.990
TIME TO BE ABLE TO SPEND THAT

01:48:17.057 --> 01:48:18.124
MONEY.

01:48:18.191 --> 01:48:19.759
BUT THE FOCUS IN TERMS OF YOU

01:48:19.826 --> 01:48:21.194
ARE IN IN GIVING THE ANSWER TO

01:48:21.261 --> 01:48:21.962
CENTER NIELSEN WHICH I THINK WAS

01:48:22.028 --> 01:48:22.863
QUITE INSIGHTFUL WAS DIVIDING UP

01:48:22.929 --> 01:48:24.264
THE MITIGATION IDEA TO THREE

01:48:24.331 --> 01:48:24.564
CONSCIOUS.

01:48:24.631 --> 01:48:26.366
PEOPLE MANAGEMENT THE CLEARING

01:48:26.433 --> 01:48:28.535
AND ALSO THE HARDENING OF HOMES

01:48:28.602 --> 01:48:30.203
AND THE HARDENING OF HOMES AND

01:48:30.270 --> 01:48:32.439
CLEARING SPACE THE DISPENSABLE

01:48:32.505 --> 01:48:33.473
SPACE I THINK SENATOR GERMAN HAS

01:48:33.540 --> 01:48:34.674
A BILL ON THAT.

01:48:34.741 --> 01:48:36.776
THOSE TWO THINGS COSTS THE

01:48:36.843 --> 01:48:37.844
GREATEST AMOUNT OF BOTH WRIST TO

01:48:37.911 --> 01:48:39.112
HUMAN LIFE.

01:48:39.179 --> 01:48:40.680
AND PROPERTY DAMAGE TO WHICH

01:48:40.747 --> 01:48:42.382
CENTER JACKSON REFERRED SO THE

01:48:42.449 --> 01:48:45.185
IDEA WAS SEEMS THAT IN TERMS OF

01:48:45.252 --> 01:48:46.253
THE RISK MANAGEMENT THAT THE

01:48:46.319 --> 01:48:47.921
HIGHEST AND BEST USE OF THOSE

01:48:47.988 --> 01:48:49.356
REST DOLLARS THAT WE HAVE.

01:48:49.422 --> 01:48:51.057
GOVERNOR'S ALLOCATING OR WE

01:48:51.124 --> 01:48:52.792
MIGHT WANT TO PROPOSE WOULD BE

01:48:52.859 --> 01:48:54.728
TO TALK ABOUT HARDENING OF HOMES

01:48:54.794 --> 01:48:56.296
INDISPENSABLE SPACE. TO REDUCE

01:48:56.363 --> 01:48:58.431
THAT THAT RISK PROFILE AS MUCH

01:48:58.498 --> 01:48:59.366
AS WE POSSIBLY COULD IS THAT A

01:48:59.432 --> 01:49:00.400
FAIR STATEMENT.

01:49:00.467 --> 01:49:01.501
YEAH THAT'S A FAIR STATEMENT

01:49:01.568 --> 01:49:03.136
OKAY AND THE MORE WE PUT IN

01:49:03.203 --> 01:49:07.307
INTELLIGENTLY OF A SPENT

01:49:07.374 --> 01:49:07.607
[inaudible]

01:49:07.674 --> 01:49:08.808
X. EXPEDITED AS QUICKLY AS

01:49:08.875 --> 01:49:10.610
POSSIBLE WITH ALSO COULD FOLLOW

01:49:10.677 --> 01:49:11.745
THAT'S SUPPORT THAT LINE IF

01:49:11.811 --> 01:49:12.812
YOU'RE THINKING CORRECT I AGREE

01:49:12.879 --> 01:49:14.381
I THINK TIME IS OF THE ESSENCE

01:49:14.447 --> 01:49:15.615
OKAY LAST POINT.

01:49:15.682 --> 01:49:16.983
WHICH FINANCING YOUR BRIDGE

01:49:17.050 --> 01:49:18.318
FINANCING WITH RESPECT TO

01:49:18.385 --> 01:49:19.719
LIQUIDITY FUND WHAT I'M

01:49:19.786 --> 01:49:21.054
INTERESTED THERE YES IT DOES

01:49:21.121 --> 01:49:22.789
GIVE US A SMALLER NUMBER YES IT

01:49:22.856 --> 01:49:23.823
GIVES COOLEY QUIDDITY O THE

01:49:23.890 --> 01:49:28.028
ENTITIES INTERESTING.

01:49:28.094 --> 01:49:30.063
BUT THE MOST PROBATIVE ELEMENT

01:49:30.130 --> 01:49:32.232
OF THAT SEEMS TO ME IS WE'LL

01:49:32.299 --> 01:49:34.067
THAT INFORMED THE RATING

01:49:34.134 --> 01:49:36.870
AGENCIES TO GIVE THEM COMFORT.

01:49:36.937 --> 01:49:38.171
EVEN IF TAKE LET'S ASSUME WE DO

01:49:38.238 --> 01:49:39.873
THE SIX TO ONE WE COME UP WITH A

01:49:39.940 --> 01:49:40.974
LOT OF MONEY IN HARDING LET'S

01:49:41.041 --> 01:49:43.243
ASSUME WE DO THESE OTHER THINGS.

01:49:43.310 --> 01:49:45.812
IS A LIQUIDITY FUND AS COMPARED

01:49:45.879 --> 01:49:48.682
BROADLY SPEAKING TO A LIABILITY

01:49:48.748 --> 01:49:50.083
INSURANCE POLICY.

01:49:50.150 --> 01:49:52.252
SOMETHING THAT IN YOUR BEST GAS

01:49:52.319 --> 01:49:52.819
BECAUSE I KNOW YOU'RE JUST

01:49:52.886 --> 01:49:53.853
GUESSING BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT A

01:49:53.920 --> 01:49:55.522
RATING AGENCY BUT YOU CERTAINLY

01:49:55.588 --> 01:49:56.923
HAVE SPENT A LOT OF TIME ON HERE

01:49:56.990 --> 01:50:00.060
AT ALL WE CAN DO IS RELY ON YOUR

01:50:00.126 --> 01:50:00.327
JUDGMENT.

01:50:00.393 --> 01:50:01.494
IS THAT.

01:50:01.561 --> 01:50:03.897
A COURSE THAT WILL RESULT IN THE

01:50:03.964 --> 01:50:05.231
RATING AGENCIES.

01:50:05.298 --> 01:50:07.167
ARE GIVING US THE CLEARANCE SO

01:50:07.233 --> 01:50:08.301
WE DON'T HAVE THESE BIG HIGH

01:50:08.368 --> 01:50:10.437
PRICES FOR BARRING THAT RESULTS

01:50:10.503 --> 01:50:12.672
IN RATE PAYERS EPENSES GOING UP

01:50:12.739 --> 01:50:15.809
BECAUSE THE COST OF CAPITAL SO I

01:50:15.875 --> 01:50:16.810
IN MY JUDGMENT.

01:50:16.876 --> 01:50:18.578
THE RATINGS AGENCIES AT THIS

01:50:18.645 --> 01:50:20.547
POINT GIVEN THAT THEY'VE YOU

01:50:20.613 --> 01:50:22.148
INVERSE CONDEMNATION REFORM IS A

01:50:22.215 --> 01:50:23.650
LOW PROBABILITY OUTCOME.

01:50:23.717 --> 01:50:27.387
ARE MOST INTERESTED IN --

01:50:27.454 --> 01:50:28.922
CHANGES TO THE COST RECOVERY

01:50:28.989 --> 01:50:31.891
REGIME THAT MAKE IT VERY CERTAIN.

01:50:31.958 --> 01:50:33.893
THAT IF THERE IS A SO CALLED

01:50:33.960 --> 01:50:36.296
WILDFIRE EXPENSE IT WILL BE

01:50:36.363 --> 01:50:41.167
PASSED TO RATE PAYERS -- IF.

01:50:41.234 --> 01:50:42.702
THE AND THAT IS WHAT WILL.

01:50:42.769 --> 01:50:45.905
INCREASE CERTAINTY FOR INVESTORS

01:50:45.972 --> 01:50:47.007
THAT THEY HAVE A LOWER RISK

01:50:47.073 --> 01:50:48.408
INVESTMENTS IN A CALIFORNIA

01:50:48.475 --> 01:50:50.343
UTILITY WHICH IS WHAT THEY WANT

01:50:50.410 --> 01:50:51.878
TO AND FRANKLY WHAT WE WANT

01:50:51.945 --> 01:50:53.713
UTILITIES TO BE LOW RISK AS WELL

01:50:53.780 --> 01:50:54.647
SO THEY HAVE LOW BORROWING COSTS

01:50:54.714 --> 01:50:56.182
AND CAN BUILD INFRASTRUCTURE.

01:50:56.249 --> 01:50:57.884
COST EFFECTIVELY.

01:50:57.951 --> 01:50:59.652
THE PROBLEM IS.

01:50:59.719 --> 01:51:01.621
IN THE CURRENT SITUATION IF WE

01:51:01.688 --> 01:51:06.026
WERE -- TO DE RISK UTILITY COST

01:51:06.092 --> 01:51:07.827
RECOVERY THAT'S EXPOSING RATE

01:51:07.894 --> 01:51:10.363
PAYERS TO POTENTIALLY PUNISHING

01:51:10.430 --> 01:51:11.231
EXPENSE.

01:51:11.297 --> 01:51:14.734
AND AND SO YOU COULD HAVE A YOU

01:51:14.801 --> 01:51:15.869
KNOW THAT THERE THERE ARE THERE

01:51:15.935 --> 01:51:17.937
IS PROBABLY A SWEET SPOT IN THE

01:51:18.004 --> 01:51:19.372
LIQUIDITY FUNDS WHERE YOU BILL

01:51:19.439 --> 01:51:20.640
TO FIND IS LARGE ENOUGH.

01:51:20.707 --> 01:51:23.109
YOU GIVE SOME MODEST.

01:51:23.176 --> 01:51:24.577
COST RECOVERY REFORMS AND AND

01:51:24.644 --> 01:51:27.547
AND AND I THINK YOU KNOW PERHAPS --

01:51:27.614 --> 01:51:29.149
YOU COULD BRAIN THE RATING

01:51:29.215 --> 01:51:31.217
AGENCIES TO THE TABLE

01:51:31.284 --> 01:51:33.420
PARTICULARLY IF THAT WERE PAIRED

01:51:33.486 --> 01:51:34.621
WITH YOU KNOW MASSIVE

01:51:34.687 --> 01:51:36.256
INVESTMENTS AND MITIGATION RIGHT

01:51:36.322 --> 01:51:39.659
SO YOU THINK YOU'RE GONNA HAVE A

01:51:39.726 --> 01:51:41.394
SMALLER RISK OF RAW.

01:51:41.461 --> 01:51:42.062
I GUESS FROM MY PERSPECTIVE WE

01:51:42.128 --> 01:51:43.463
YOU WOULD NEED TO CONSULT WITH

01:51:43.530 --> 01:51:46.366
ASSN P. IN MOVIES AND TO TO

01:51:46.433 --> 01:51:47.434
REALLY KNOW FOR SURE THAT AT AND

01:51:47.500 --> 01:51:48.968
TO CAN I JUST FOLLOW UP ON THAT

01:51:49.035 --> 01:51:49.402
JUST.

01:51:49.469 --> 01:51:50.837
APOLOGIZE TO DRILL THE THE BILL

01:51:50.904 --> 01:51:52.839
A LITTLE IN DEEPER WE TALKED

01:51:52.906 --> 01:51:54.107
ABOUT VARIOUS COMMITTEES COMING

01:51:54.174 --> 01:51:55.208
FORTH WITH IDEAS AND CREATING

01:51:55.275 --> 01:51:56.876
COMPETITION A GREAT ENTERPRISE

01:51:56.943 --> 01:51:58.678
VALUE.

01:51:58.745 --> 01:52:00.613
IF YOU WERE.

01:52:00.680 --> 01:52:02.382
TO SIX A LIQUIDITY FUND VERSUS A

01:52:02.449 --> 01:52:04.584
LIABILITY FUND WOULD NOT BE

01:52:04.651 --> 01:52:06.553
EASIER AND I COULD BE WRONG I'M

01:52:06.619 --> 01:52:08.154
NOT TRYING TO BE LEADING THE NEW

01:52:08.221 --> 01:52:09.489
ON THIS I'M JUST TRYING TO

01:52:09.556 --> 01:52:10.824
UNDERSTAND IT BY LEADING YOU.

01:52:10.890 --> 01:52:12.492
WOULD NOT BE EASIER IF YOU'RE

01:52:12.559 --> 01:52:16.262
GOING TO GET EQUITY OUT OF

01:52:16.329 --> 01:52:17.797
SHAREHOLDERS OR LENDERS WHO

01:52:17.864 --> 01:52:19.566
WHOEVER THEY MIGHT BE WOULDN'T

01:52:19.632 --> 01:52:21.701
IT BE EASIER ENOUGH TO GET THAT

01:52:21.768 --> 01:52:23.103
MONEY INTO A FUND THAN JUST

01:52:23.169 --> 01:52:24.804
BASICALLY A BANK.

01:52:24.871 --> 01:52:26.639
WHICH WAS A LOAN FUND WHERE THEY

01:52:26.706 --> 01:52:28.708
WOULD ACTUALLY YOU KNOW IN TERMS

01:52:28.775 --> 01:52:30.443
OF A FOR ONE OF OUR CHALLENGE

01:52:30.510 --> 01:52:31.811
WERE FACING IS YOU KNOW ALL

01:52:31.878 --> 01:52:33.179
THESE THINGS WERE JUGGLING RIGHT

01:52:33.246 --> 01:52:35.648
WE'RE TRYING TO MINIMIZE THAT

01:52:35.715 --> 01:52:37.383
SHOCK STICKER SHOCK TO TO RATE

01:52:37.450 --> 01:52:38.718
PAYERS IS REALLY IMPORTANT I

01:52:38.785 --> 01:52:39.185
THINK FAIR TO SAY.

01:52:39.252 --> 01:52:41.287
THE COMMITTEE REALLY IMPORTANT

01:52:41.354 --> 01:52:43.323
THE SAME TIME WE WANT TO SEE IF

01:52:43.389 --> 01:52:44.457
WE CAN TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THAT

01:52:44.524 --> 01:52:46.259
COMPETITION IN THE IN THE WAY

01:52:46.326 --> 01:52:47.927
THAT PROTECTS US IS CALIFORNIA

01:52:47.994 --> 01:52:49.829
TAXPAYERS AND RATEPAYERS.

01:52:49.896 --> 01:52:52.499
CAN WE DO THAT AND IS THE FUND

01:52:52.565 --> 01:52:54.567
THE MODEL A BETTER MODEL TO

01:52:54.634 --> 01:52:56.603
CONSTRUCT IN YOUR JUDGMENT THEN

01:52:56.669 --> 01:53:00.673
THE BRIDGE FINANCING MODEL.

01:53:00.740 --> 01:53:01.241
I THINK THE BRIDGE FINANCING

01:53:01.307 --> 01:53:02.509
MODEL IF WE CANNOT.

01:53:02.575 --> 01:53:04.811
BRAIN UTILITIES TO THE TABLE --

01:53:04.878 --> 01:53:05.845
IF THEY DON'T SEE IT IS IN THEIR

01:53:05.912 --> 01:53:07.380
INTEREST TO PARTICIPATE THE

01:53:07.447 --> 01:53:09.048
BRIDGE FINANCING MODEL HAS A LOT

01:53:09.115 --> 01:53:12.919
GOING FOR IT -- IF WE CAN.

01:53:12.986 --> 01:53:17.790
AND THEY ARE WILLING -- TO PUT.

01:53:17.857 --> 01:53:19.392
IF THEY'RE WILLING TO YOU KNOW

01:53:19.459 --> 01:53:20.994
AND WE WE DON'T SPECIFY NUMBERS

01:53:21.060 --> 01:53:22.162
IN OUR REPORT WE THINK OF THIS

01:53:22.228 --> 01:53:23.763
IS KIND OF ROUGHLY EQUAL

01:53:23.830 --> 01:53:25.064
CONTRIBUTIONS RIGHT.

01:53:25.131 --> 01:53:26.032
RATEPAYERS PUT A DOLLAR ON THE

01:53:26.099 --> 01:53:27.333
TABLE SHAREHOLDERS ARE PUTTING

01:53:27.400 --> 01:53:29.402
IT ON THE TABLE IF THAT KIND OF

01:53:29.469 --> 01:53:32.605
ARRANGEMENT AS POSSIBLE -- THEN

01:53:32.672 --> 01:53:35.408
THE LARGER FIND -- IS A IS AN

01:53:35.475 --> 01:53:36.209
INTRIGUING POSSIBILITY TO

01:53:36.276 --> 01:53:37.510
CONSIDER AND WHERE DOES THE

01:53:37.577 --> 01:53:39.012
MONEY COME FOR THE BRIDGE

01:53:39.078 --> 01:53:42.549
FINANCING MODEL WAS A CABS

01:53:42.615 --> 01:53:43.149
REGIONALLY IT WOULD COME FROM

01:53:43.216 --> 01:53:43.583
REPAIRS.

01:53:43.650 --> 01:53:45.318
BUT IT'S IMPORTANT TO REALIZE

01:53:45.385 --> 01:53:47.353
REPAIRS WOULD NOT -- LATELY IT'S

01:53:47.420 --> 01:53:49.589
BECAUSE IT'S A REVOLVING LOAN

01:53:49.656 --> 01:53:50.924
REPAIRS ARE GONNA GET BACK THE

01:53:50.990 --> 01:53:52.926
MONEY WILL GO OUT AND IT'LL COME

01:53:52.992 --> 01:53:53.159
BACK IN.

01:53:53.226 --> 01:53:57.797
INTERIOR.

01:53:57.864 --> 01:53:59.232
YEAH THAT THE PRIMARY RISK THAT

01:53:59.299 --> 01:54:02.001
I WORRY ABOUT IN THAT CONTEXT

01:54:02.068 --> 01:54:03.670
WOULD BE.

01:54:03.736 --> 01:54:04.537
EIGHTY A BRIDGE LOAN TO AN

01:54:04.604 --> 01:54:08.708
ENTITY TO GOES BANKRUPT --

01:54:08.775 --> 01:54:10.810
THAT'S THAT'S THE RISK I THINK

01:54:10.877 --> 01:54:15.181
THEIR WAYS OF MANAGING AT RISK.

01:54:15.248 --> 01:54:16.549
SO I THINK OUR GENEROSITY.

01:54:16.616 --> 01:54:17.817
REALLY WANTED TO GO IN.

01:54:17.884 --> 01:54:18.785
THANK YOU PROFESSOR WHO ARE I I

01:54:18.851 --> 01:54:20.420
JUST WANT TO GO OVER A FEW

01:54:20.486 --> 01:54:22.222
ASSUMPTIONS VERY BASIC -- THE

01:54:22.288 --> 01:54:25.291
FIRST IS THAT -- CALIFORNIA IS

01:54:25.358 --> 01:54:28.294
UNIQUE IN THIS PLANET.

01:54:28.361 --> 01:54:30.563
THAT ARE WILDFIRES ARE STARTED

01:54:30.630 --> 01:54:32.599
BY UTILITIES IT DOESN'T HAPPEN.

01:54:32.665 --> 01:54:34.000
I MEAN WE HAVE WILD FIRES ALL

01:54:34.067 --> 01:54:35.034
OVER THE GLOBE EUROPE.

01:54:35.101 --> 01:54:36.936
FLORIDA.

01:54:37.003 --> 01:54:38.671
ARIZONA BUT WE'RE UNIQUE THAT

01:54:38.738 --> 01:54:39.505
THERE [inaudible]

01:54:39.572 --> 01:54:41.808
UTILITY.

01:54:41.874 --> 01:54:42.976
START ARM.

01:54:43.042 --> 01:54:44.944
UTILITIES.

01:54:45.011 --> 01:54:46.613
IN GENERAL STARFIRE'S IF YOU

01:54:46.679 --> 01:54:48.748
STRAIN HIGH VOLTAGE WIRES THAT

01:54:48.815 --> 01:54:49.749
ARE UNINSULATED ALL OVER THE

01:54:49.816 --> 01:54:51.150
LANDSCAPE AND THERE ARE TREES

01:54:51.217 --> 01:54:52.185
AND THERE IS WHETHER.

01:54:52.252 --> 01:54:53.987
THOSE WIRES WILL EVENTUALLY FALL

01:54:54.053 --> 01:54:54.554
DOWN AND SOMETIMES THEY WILL

01:54:54.621 --> 01:54:55.488
START FIRES.

01:54:55.555 --> 01:54:57.523
USUALLY THE DIFFERENCE WHAT'S

01:54:57.590 --> 01:54:59.425
GOING ON IN CALIFORNIA THAT'S

01:54:59.492 --> 01:55:00.393
DIFFERENT IS THAT.

01:55:00.460 --> 01:55:01.995
WHEN THOSE FIRE STARTS AT

01:55:02.061 --> 01:55:02.996
CERTAIN POINTS IN THE FALL IN

01:55:03.062 --> 01:55:04.397
CALIFORNIA?

01:55:04.464 --> 01:55:07.800
THERE IS NO WAY TO PUT THEM OUT.

01:55:07.867 --> 01:55:10.536
OUR AND THE THE ONLY POSSIBLE

01:55:10.603 --> 01:55:12.305
RESPONSE OF FIRST RESPONDERS TO

01:55:12.372 --> 01:55:12.939
TRY TO MOVE PEOPLE OUT OF THE

01:55:13.006 --> 01:55:13.973
WAY.

01:55:14.040 --> 01:55:16.009
THAT'S DIFFERENT.

01:55:16.075 --> 01:55:17.143
AND ENGINE THAT HASN'T BEEN THE

01:55:17.210 --> 01:55:18.344
EXPERIENCE IN OTHER STATES AT

01:55:18.411 --> 01:55:20.246
LEAST SO FAR.

01:55:20.313 --> 01:55:21.581
NOW I COME FROM A COUNTY THAT

01:55:21.648 --> 01:55:23.216
HAS WID BUYER EXPERIENCE TO ME

01:55:23.283 --> 01:55:24.851
LOOK AT AUSTRALIA AND OTHER

01:55:24.917 --> 01:55:25.084
MODELS.

01:55:25.151 --> 01:55:26.252
BUT I'M JUST TRYING.

01:55:26.319 --> 01:55:27.854
TO YOU AS WE FOCUS ON THIS TOPIC

01:55:27.920 --> 01:55:28.821
WE'RE JUST TALKING ABOUT

01:55:28.888 --> 01:55:30.623
CALIFORNIA THIS UNIQUE PLACE ON

01:55:30.690 --> 01:55:32.325
THE PLANET THAT HAS UTILITIES

01:55:32.392 --> 01:55:34.527
STARTED FIRES -- SO THAT MEANS

01:55:34.594 --> 01:55:36.429
WE HAVE NO MODELS THERE'S NO

01:55:36.496 --> 01:55:37.397
OTHER.

01:55:37.463 --> 01:55:38.965
MUNICIPALITY ON THE GLOBE THAT'S

01:55:39.032 --> 01:55:42.869
GOT A VICTIMS FUND CORRECT --

01:55:42.935 --> 01:55:44.704
THERE ARE NO THERE'S NO

01:55:44.771 --> 01:55:46.639
EQUIVALENT FOR UTILITY COST

01:55:46.706 --> 01:55:48.107
WILDFIRE.

01:55:48.174 --> 01:55:50.109
THERE ARE FUNDS THEIR SO CALLED

01:55:50.176 --> 01:55:51.678
CATASTROPHE FUNDS THAT A NUMBER

01:55:51.744 --> 01:55:53.146
OF STATES IN THE UNITED STATES

01:55:53.212 --> 01:55:53.780
OF CREATED THE BEAR SOME

01:55:53.846 --> 01:55:56.215
RESEMBLANCE SO IN PARTICULAR.

01:55:56.282 --> 01:55:58.217
THE FLORIDA HER KINKY TAX FREE

01:55:58.284 --> 01:56:00.253
FUND IS ONE EXAMPLE THERE ARE

01:56:00.320 --> 01:56:02.221
MODIFICATIONS OF THE FAIR PLAN

01:56:02.288 --> 01:56:04.457
IN OTHER STATES IN THE SOUTHEAST

01:56:04.524 --> 01:56:05.558
THAT LOOK A LOT LIKE A

01:56:05.625 --> 01:56:07.393
CATASTROPHE FOUNDER OF VICTIMS

01:56:07.460 --> 01:56:10.363
FUND -- BUT THEY ARE DIFFERENT

01:56:10.430 --> 01:56:12.031
IN THE SENSE THAT THEY PAY.

01:56:12.098 --> 01:56:15.034
THEIR DAY ARE IN GENERAL EITHER --

01:56:15.101 --> 01:56:16.803
THERE IS THERE IN GENERAL -- A

01:56:16.869 --> 01:56:18.771
REINSURER SO THEY THEY BACKED

01:56:18.838 --> 01:56:20.640
THE PRIMARY HOME INSURERS RATHER

01:56:20.707 --> 01:56:23.976
THAN BACKING THE UTILITIES

01:56:24.043 --> 01:56:25.378
AGAINST THIRD PARTY CLAIMS.

01:56:25.445 --> 01:56:25.978
THANK YOU THEN I I'LL DO MORE

01:56:26.045 --> 01:56:27.113
RESEARCH ON HER CANE.

01:56:27.180 --> 01:56:28.648
I'D BE HAPPY TO SHARE SOME

01:56:28.715 --> 01:56:30.049
INFORMATION WITH YOU ABOUT THAT

01:56:30.116 --> 01:56:30.950
THAT'S REAL HELPFUL AND I

01:56:31.017 --> 01:56:32.418
APPRECIATE THAT BECAUSE I'M.

01:56:32.485 --> 01:56:34.787
I'M TRYING TO LOOK AT YOUR

01:56:34.854 --> 01:56:35.321
COMMENT IT WOULD JUST TAKE

01:56:35.388 --> 01:56:36.656
LEADERSHIP.

01:56:36.723 --> 01:56:37.957
WE JUST YOU KNOW WE JUST NEED TO

01:56:38.024 --> 01:56:40.360
DO THIS AND AND I'M KINDA

01:56:40.426 --> 01:56:42.095
LOOKING AT THE CONSTRAINTS FROM

01:56:42.161 --> 01:56:44.664
MY LITTLE VANTAGE POINT BUT I'M

01:56:44.731 --> 01:56:46.833
LOOKING AT LET'S SAY A BUDGET

01:56:46.899 --> 01:56:49.569
WHERE WE GET THE LARGEST BUDGET

01:56:49.635 --> 01:56:49.869
WE'VE EVER.

01:56:49.936 --> 01:56:52.739
PRODUCED.

01:56:52.805 --> 01:56:54.040
WORKING ON THE BUDGET LAST NIGHT

01:56:54.107 --> 01:56:56.642
ABOUT TEN PM.

01:56:56.709 --> 01:56:59.479
AND I DID SEE ONE DOLLAR GO.

01:56:59.545 --> 01:57:01.848
TO ANY FUND FOR FIRE MEDICATION

01:57:01.914 --> 01:57:03.649
OR VICTIMS BUT I DIDN'T SEE THE

01:57:03.716 --> 01:57:05.218
STATE'S STEP UP WITH ONE DOLLAR

01:57:05.284 --> 01:57:06.619
I SAW A LOT OF PORK GOING TO A

01:57:06.686 --> 01:57:10.523
LOT OF DISTRICTS IN THIS STATE --

01:57:10.590 --> 01:57:13.326
I SAW A DEFERRED MAINTENANCE

01:57:13.393 --> 01:57:16.662
FUND REDUCED 50% BECAUSE WE WERE

01:57:16.729 --> 01:57:18.297
GIVING SO MUCH MONEY AWAY. TO

01:57:18.364 --> 01:57:19.966
OTHER OTHERAREAS AND I'M AND

01:57:20.032 --> 01:57:20.566
I'M TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHERE

01:57:20.633 --> 01:57:22.235
IS THE LEADERSHIP GOING TO COME

01:57:22.301 --> 01:57:24.937
FROM -- BECAUSE JUST LAST WEEK

01:57:25.004 --> 01:57:27.440
WE WE RECEIVED OUR COMPREHENSIVE

01:57:27.507 --> 01:57:29.208
ANNUAL FINANCIAL REPORT.

01:57:29.275 --> 01:57:31.010
YOU KNOW GETTING IN JUNE A YEAR

01:57:31.077 --> 01:57:32.478
LATER AFTER THE YEAR AND ALMOST.

01:57:32.545 --> 01:57:33.880
AND WE HAVE THE LARGEST

01:57:33.946 --> 01:57:35.214
UNRESTRICTED NET DEFICIT OUR

01:57:35.281 --> 01:57:37.283
STATE'S HISTORY IT'S NOW 200-13

01:57:37.350 --> 01:57:38.851
BILLION FOR A GOVERNMENTAL

01:57:38.918 --> 01:57:40.453
ACTIVITIES AND WE'RE TALKING

01:57:40.520 --> 01:57:42.255
REPAIRS WERE TALKING TAXPAYERS

01:57:42.321 --> 01:57:43.756
THEIR THEIR STOCK CAN MEAN WE'RE

01:57:43.823 --> 01:57:45.324
TALKING OVER UTILITIES REALLY

01:57:45.391 --> 01:57:46.526
GOVERNMENT AND JUST.

01:57:46.592 --> 01:57:50.096
YOU KNOW SEGREGATED FORM AND AND

01:57:50.163 --> 01:57:50.797
SO I'M I'M TRYING [inaudible]

01:57:50.863 --> 01:57:51.597
TO FIGURE OUT.

01:57:51.664 --> 01:57:53.566
HOW TO FIX THIS BECAUSE OUR

01:57:53.633 --> 01:57:54.801
ELECTRICITY RATES ARE REALLY

01:57:54.867 --> 01:57:56.502
REALLY HIGH?

01:57:56.569 --> 01:57:58.738
P. GENIES RATES ARE WELL ABOVE

01:57:58.805 --> 01:58:01.941
THE NATIONAL AND AND STATE RATES

01:58:02.008 --> 01:58:03.910
AND AS WE HAVE INDUSTRY THAT'S

01:58:03.976 --> 01:58:05.311
NOT GONNA DO WELL IF WE RAISE

01:58:05.378 --> 01:58:06.646
THEIR RATES.

01:58:06.712 --> 01:58:08.014
ASKING THEM TO OKAY YOU BE A

01:58:08.080 --> 01:58:09.081
LEADER IN THEIR KIND OF GOING

01:58:09.148 --> 01:58:10.283
WELL MAYBE WILL LEAD SOMEWHERE

01:58:10.349 --> 01:58:12.752
ELSE BECAUSE WE CAN MANUFACTURE.

01:58:12.819 --> 01:58:14.387
SO I'M LOOKING AT ALL THESE

01:58:14.454 --> 01:58:16.189
CONSTRAINTS IN A BAD BALANCE

01:58:16.255 --> 01:58:18.658
SHEET HI RATES NO WILLINGNESS TO

01:58:18.724 --> 01:58:20.660
SET BONTA SIDE IN THIS BUDGET TO

01:58:20.726 --> 01:58:21.360
REALLY.

01:58:21.427 --> 01:58:22.862
SHOW SOME RESOLVE [inaudible]

01:58:22.929 --> 01:58:23.596
SO.

01:58:23.663 --> 01:58:27.033
I'M KIND OF DUMPING IT ON YOU

01:58:27.099 --> 01:58:27.900
I'M KIND OF COMPLAINING BUT I'M

01:58:27.967 --> 01:58:29.368
TRYING THIS BABY PLEADING LIKE

01:58:29.435 --> 01:58:30.536
OKAY WHERE.

01:58:30.603 --> 01:58:33.172
WHERE'S THE MOVEMENT GOING TO BE.

01:58:33.239 --> 01:58:34.974
WELL I I DON'T.

01:58:35.041 --> 01:58:37.210
HAVE A CLEAR ANSWER THEIR CENTER

01:58:37.276 --> 01:58:39.779
MORE LUCK BUT I WOULD SAY THAT.

01:58:39.846 --> 01:58:41.113
ANY POLICY PROPOSAL.

01:58:41.180 --> 01:58:43.783
SHOULD GO THROUGH AN ANALYSIS

01:58:43.850 --> 01:58:45.318
WORRIED IT IS SHOWN.

01:58:45.384 --> 01:58:47.253
THAT THE FUND OR WHATEVER WE

01:58:47.320 --> 01:58:51.958
ENACT -- IS BETTER FOR

01:58:52.024 --> 01:58:53.326
RATEPAYERS.

01:58:53.392 --> 01:58:55.127
THAN THE STATUS QUO.

01:58:55.194 --> 01:58:56.762
RIGHT AT YOU KNOW WE NEED TO

01:58:56.829 --> 01:58:57.296
THERE THERE NEEDS TO BE A

01:58:57.363 --> 01:58:58.498
SHOWING.

01:58:58.564 --> 01:59:00.066
AND THE STATUS QUO IS GRAHAM YOU

01:59:00.132 --> 01:59:02.301
KNOW I MENTIONED ACOSTA CAPITAL

01:59:02.368 --> 01:59:03.236
REQUESTS.

01:59:03.302 --> 01:59:04.971
I HAD THE OTHER ISSUES ARE WHAT

01:59:05.037 --> 01:59:06.372
HAPPENS WITH ABOUT WHILE FAR

01:59:06.439 --> 01:59:08.007
LIABILITIES WHAT HAPPENS YOU

01:59:08.074 --> 01:59:09.842
KNOW THE COST OF GREAT HARDENING

01:59:09.909 --> 01:59:11.077
ARE NONTRIVIAL.

01:59:11.143 --> 01:59:11.978
THEY'RE GONNA HAPPEN OVER THE

01:59:12.044 --> 01:59:13.446
NEXT DECADE SO.

01:59:13.513 --> 01:59:17.517
RATES ARE UNFORTUNATELY GOING UP.

01:59:17.583 --> 01:59:19.151
AND THE QUESTION IS CAN A

01:59:19.218 --> 01:59:21.354
WELFARE FUNDS.

01:59:21.420 --> 01:59:23.256
STABILIZE THAT SITUATION MAKE

01:59:23.322 --> 01:59:25.892
THINGS LESS BAD THAN THEY WOULD

01:59:25.958 --> 01:59:31.230
HAVE BEEN -- AND AND AND HELP --

01:59:31.297 --> 01:59:33.132
TO TO INSURE BOTH SAID REPAIRS

01:59:33.199 --> 01:59:34.400
DON'T GET SURPRISED WITH THE

01:59:34.467 --> 01:59:37.236
BILL SO THEY CAN PLAN AND ALSO

01:59:37.303 --> 01:59:39.071
THAT VICTIMS GET PAID.

01:59:39.138 --> 01:59:39.672
THANK YOU PROFESSOR THANK YOU

01:59:39.739 --> 01:59:40.973
MISTER.

01:59:41.040 --> 01:59:42.108
THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN THANK

01:59:42.174 --> 01:59:44.010
YOU PROFESSOR FOR ALL THE TIME

01:59:44.076 --> 01:59:45.444
YOU SPENT ON THIS IT'S IT'S

01:59:45.511 --> 01:59:46.913
PHENOMENAL MUCH APPRECIATED.

01:59:46.979 --> 01:59:48.814
OF YOU MENTION WE TALK ABOUT THE

01:59:48.881 --> 01:59:50.316
THE CREATION AND THE

01:59:50.383 --> 01:59:52.184
ESTABLISHMENT FUND THAT THERE

01:59:52.251 --> 01:59:52.919
WOULD BE.

01:59:52.985 --> 01:59:54.654
NO OF RATE PAYERS IN THE

01:59:54.720 --> 01:59:56.322
UTILITIES AND OTHER ACTORS WHO

01:59:56.389 --> 01:59:59.725
THOSE OTHER ACTORS THAT WOULD

01:59:59.792 --> 02:00:00.660
PARTICIPATE IN THAT THAT YOU SEE.

02:00:00.726 --> 02:00:03.429
IN THE INNER REPORT.

02:00:03.496 --> 02:00:07.767
WE SUGGESTS THAT THE LEGISLATURE

02:00:07.833 --> 02:00:09.201
SHOULD AT LEAST CONSIDER THE

02:00:09.268 --> 02:00:10.603
IDEA OF A SURCHARGE AND

02:00:10.670 --> 02:00:13.172
INSURANCE RATES -- ELECTRICITY

02:00:13.239 --> 02:00:14.640
RATES IN CALIFORNIA ARE AMONG

02:00:14.707 --> 02:00:15.975
THE HIGHEST.

02:00:16.042 --> 02:00:19.612
IN THE NATION OUR BILLS ARE MORE

02:00:19.679 --> 02:00:20.580
UNDER CONTROL BECAUSE OF OUR

02:00:20.646 --> 02:00:22.048
VERY AGGRESSIVE ENERGY

02:00:22.114 --> 02:00:23.583
EFFICIENCY POLICIES.

02:00:23.649 --> 02:00:27.887
ARE BY THE THE ON OUR HOME

02:00:27.954 --> 02:00:30.323
INTEREST RATES ARE ACTUALLY --

02:00:30.389 --> 02:00:32.058
ON THE VERY LOW AND I THINK

02:00:32.124 --> 02:00:33.659
WE'RE FORTY SECONDS -- BEFORE

02:00:33.726 --> 02:00:37.797
YOU EVEN ADJUST FOR INCOME AND

02:00:37.863 --> 02:00:39.131
VALUE IN SHIRT WHICH OBVIOUSLY.

02:00:39.198 --> 02:00:40.366
VERY DIFFERENT CALIFORNIA AND IN

02:00:40.433 --> 02:00:42.435
MANY PLACES NOW OF COURSE.

02:00:42.501 --> 02:00:44.236
IN THE WILL BE IN THE HIGH RISK

02:00:44.303 --> 02:00:46.038
AREAS LIKE WHERE SENATOR JACKSON

02:00:46.105 --> 02:00:47.206
LIVES.

02:00:47.273 --> 02:00:48.941
OUT WHERE I LIVE -- I AND NUMBER

02:00:49.008 --> 02:00:50.443
OF MY NEIGHBORS HAVE RECENTLY

02:00:50.509 --> 02:00:52.111
GONE TO LLOYDS OF LONDON TO GET

02:00:52.178 --> 02:00:55.581
THEIR POLICIES -- THEY THE COSTS

02:00:55.648 --> 02:00:59.085
ARE MUCH HIGHER -- THE IDEA OF A

02:00:59.151 --> 02:01:00.720
SURCHARGE AN INSURANCE RACES IS

02:01:00.786 --> 02:01:02.088
ONE THAT WE SUGGEST WHAT WE

02:01:02.154 --> 02:01:03.856
THINK -- YOU KNOW CONCEPTUALLY

02:01:03.923 --> 02:01:04.824
IT MAKES SENSE THERE ARE GOING

02:01:04.890 --> 02:01:06.626
TO BE SOME LEGAL CHALLENGES THAT

02:01:06.692 --> 02:01:08.861
NEED TO BE OVERCOME IF THAT'S A

02:01:08.928 --> 02:01:11.330
POLICY APPROACH IT'S TAKEN --

02:01:11.397 --> 02:01:13.299
ESPECIALLY IN TERMS OF MANAGING

02:01:13.366 --> 02:01:15.968
PROPOSITION TWENTY SIX

02:01:16.035 --> 02:01:18.738
REQUIREMENTS.

02:01:18.804 --> 02:01:19.305
OTHER ONE IS YOU KNOW WE'RE

02:01:19.372 --> 02:01:20.272
TALKING ABOUT.

02:01:20.339 --> 02:01:23.209
REPAIR RESPONSIBILITY IN SOME IS

02:01:23.275 --> 02:01:23.909
PART OF THE FUND AND THEN

02:01:23.976 --> 02:01:26.112
ELSEWHERE WHERE DO YOU SEE AND

02:01:26.178 --> 02:01:29.015
WHERE DOES THE THE THE COMMITTEE

02:01:29.081 --> 02:01:31.684
LOOK AT THE YOU KNOW WE SEE THAT

02:01:31.751 --> 02:01:32.752
YOU KNOW YOU HAVE THE FUND AND

02:01:32.818 --> 02:01:33.319
THEN.

02:01:33.386 --> 02:01:34.553
UTILITIES WILL CONTRIBUTE

02:01:34.620 --> 02:01:36.355
PERHAPS INSURANCE SURCHARGE ALL

02:01:36.422 --> 02:01:37.823
OF THESE OF THE WHERE DO YOU SEE

02:01:37.890 --> 02:01:40.326
THE RATE PAYERS ROLE IN THIS IN

02:01:40.393 --> 02:01:42.561
TERMS OF ANOTHER PART OF THAT

02:01:42.628 --> 02:01:43.462
WITH.

02:01:43.529 --> 02:01:44.664
YOU KNOW THEIR RESPONSIBILITY

02:01:44.730 --> 02:01:45.698
AND I UNDERSTAND THAT IT'S

02:01:45.765 --> 02:01:47.466
IMPORTANT TO HAVE THEIR PRESENCE

02:01:47.533 --> 02:01:49.769
BECAUSE OF THE THERE'S A COST

02:01:49.835 --> 02:01:51.504
THERE REGARDLESS WHEN WE TO LOOK

02:01:51.570 --> 02:01:54.340
AT THE THE COST OF BORROWING

02:01:54.407 --> 02:01:56.175
MONEY AND AND AND ELSEWHERE SO

02:01:56.242 --> 02:01:57.810
WHERE DO YOU SEE THE RATE PAYERS.

02:01:57.877 --> 02:01:59.779
PART IN THIS IN TERMS OF THEIR

02:01:59.845 --> 02:02:02.248
RESPONSIBILITY -- WITH A

02:02:02.314 --> 02:02:04.116
LIABILITY WITHOUT LIABILITY IS

02:02:04.183 --> 02:02:05.785
IT BECAUSE OF THAT.

02:02:05.851 --> 02:02:09.188
THE FACT THAT IF YOU HAVE -- HE

02:02:09.255 --> 02:02:11.457
WITH INVERSE IF.

02:02:11.524 --> 02:02:12.992
AS I LOOK AT IT IF THERE'S NO

02:02:13.059 --> 02:02:15.428
NEGLIGENCE NO LIABILITY ON THE

02:02:15.494 --> 02:02:16.896
PART OF THE UTILITY WE WE SHOULD

02:02:16.962 --> 02:02:18.364
SOCIALIZED ACOSTA BE I THINK

02:02:18.431 --> 02:02:19.198
THAT EVERYONE SHOULD BE

02:02:19.265 --> 02:02:21.100
RESPONSIBLE IS THAT WHERE YOU'RE

02:02:21.167 --> 02:02:23.436
SEEN THAT ROLE FOR THE REPAIRS

02:02:23.502 --> 02:02:24.837
IN THAT FUND IN THOSE OR

02:02:24.904 --> 02:02:26.272
CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE.

02:02:26.338 --> 02:02:30.776
THERE IS CHAIRED LIABILITY.

02:02:30.843 --> 02:02:31.877
WELL I THINK ON THE ROLE FOR

02:02:31.944 --> 02:02:33.512
RATE THE APPROPRIATE ROLE FOR

02:02:33.579 --> 02:02:35.514
RATEPAYERS.

02:02:35.581 --> 02:02:39.218
IS -- TO PAY COSTS WHEN THERE IS

02:02:39.285 --> 02:02:40.920
NO FAULT ON THE PART OF THE

02:02:40.986 --> 02:02:42.254
UTILITY IN A GIVEN THE INVERSE

02:02:42.321 --> 02:02:44.256
CONDEMNATION FRAMEWORK THAT WE

02:02:44.323 --> 02:02:47.693
HAVE -- BUT I THINK THAT THE

02:02:47.760 --> 02:02:49.562
REALITY AND AND AND AND SPEAKING

02:02:49.628 --> 02:02:51.497
SORT OF AS A STUDENT OF ENERGY

02:02:51.564 --> 02:02:53.265
REGULATION IN THE UNITED STATES

02:02:53.332 --> 02:02:54.633
THE REALITY IS THAT WHEN.

02:02:54.700 --> 02:02:55.968
MASSIVE LIFE UNEXPECTED

02:02:56.035 --> 02:02:58.104
LIABILITIES OCCUR IN THE POWER

02:02:58.170 --> 02:03:00.239
SECTOR IN REGULATED INDUSTRIES

02:03:00.306 --> 02:03:00.973
RIGHT.

02:03:01.040 --> 02:03:02.241
IF YOU LOOK BACK THROUGH HISTORY

02:03:02.308 --> 02:03:03.309
AT THE NUCLEAR POWER PLANT

02:03:03.375 --> 02:03:05.478
DISALLOWANCE IS THAT OCCURRED IN

02:03:05.544 --> 02:03:06.011
THE NINETEEN EIGHTIES FOR

02:03:06.078 --> 02:03:08.748
EXAMPLE -- WE SEE YOU KNOW ACTOR

02:03:08.814 --> 02:03:10.382
FOR RECENT NUCLEAR POWER PLANT

02:03:10.449 --> 02:03:11.717
DISALLOWANCE IS THAT HAVE

02:03:11.784 --> 02:03:12.885
OCCURRED IN SOUTH CAROLINA.

02:03:12.952 --> 02:03:15.387
WHAT WE SEE IS A HISTORY OF

02:03:15.454 --> 02:03:17.590
SHARED SACRIFICE RIGHT EVERYONE

02:03:17.656 --> 02:03:19.125
IS EVERYONE IS FORCED TO

CONTRIBUTE THE SHAREHOLDERS ARE

02:03:21.360 --> 02:03:21.961
FORCED TO CONTRIBUTE?

02:03:22.027 --> 02:03:23.095
THE RATE PAYERS ARE FORCED TO

02:03:23.162 --> 02:03:24.697
CONTRIBUTE BECAUSE WE ALL THAT

02:03:24.764 --> 02:03:26.232
THE SHAREHOLDERS NEED A STABLE

02:03:26.298 --> 02:03:27.199
BUSINESS.

02:03:27.266 --> 02:03:28.601
THE RATE PAYERS NEED PROVISION

02:03:28.667 --> 02:03:29.835
OF AN ESSENTIAL SERVICE.

02:03:29.902 --> 02:03:34.673
AND USUALLY IN THE REGULAR ORDER

02:03:34.740 --> 02:03:36.342
OF BUSINESS THAT CAN BE HANDLED

02:03:36.408 --> 02:03:37.476
AT THE P. YOU SEE.

02:03:37.543 --> 02:03:39.211

MANAGER STANDARD BUT THEN THERE

02:03:43.382 --> 02:03:46.485
ARE EXTRAORDINARY TIMES WHEN.

02:03:46.552 --> 02:03:47.419
IT IS SORT OF HIS ABOVE THE P.

02:03:47.486 --> 02:03:49.722
UC'S PAY GRADE FRANKLY AND THE

02:03:49.789 --> 02:03:51.190
LEGISLATURE.

02:03:51.257 --> 02:03:53.526
LOOKS AT THE AUTHORITY IT HASN'T

02:03:53.592 --> 02:03:55.227
HIT DELEGATES TO THE PC NORMALLY

02:03:55.294 --> 02:03:57.663
IN AND HAS TO MAKE THAT CALL.

02:03:57.730 --> 02:03:59.198
ABOUT HOW TO ALLOCATE

02:03:59.265 --> 02:04:02.301
RESPONSIBILITY FOR GETTING OUT

02:04:02.368 --> 02:04:04.470
OF A WHOLE.

02:04:04.537 --> 02:04:07.173
ARM AND I GUESS MY VIEW WOULD BE

02:04:07.239 --> 02:04:09.542
THAT EVERYONE SHOULD CONTRIBUTE.

02:04:09.608 --> 02:04:12.845
THAT WE NEED TO ENSURE THAT AS

02:04:12.912 --> 02:04:14.013
WE ARE MAKING THESE SHARED

02:04:14.079 --> 02:04:16.348
CONTRIBUTIONS THE UTILITIES ARE

02:04:16.415 --> 02:04:17.917
SETTING THEIR HOUSE IN ORDER.

02:04:17.983 --> 02:04:19.518
SO THAT THIS DOESN'T HAPPEN

02:04:19.585 --> 02:04:20.519
AGAIN.

02:04:20.586 --> 02:04:22.321
AND WE NEED TO HOLD THE TELLY

02:04:22.388 --> 02:04:24.623
MANAGEMENT ACCOUNTABLE AND SURE

02:04:24.690 --> 02:04:26.358
THAT METRICS ARE IN PLACE TO SEE

02:04:26.425 --> 02:04:27.793

02:04:27.860 --> 02:04:29.028
GOALS ARE SAT.

AND WITH WITH THOSE

02:04:33.833 --> 02:04:35.301
PRECONDITIONS.

02:04:35.367 --> 02:04:37.002
I THINK IT'S APPROPRIATE THAT WE

02:04:37.069 --> 02:04:38.137
ALL CONTRIBUTE TO STATE BECAUSE

02:04:38.204 --> 02:04:40.072
WE ALL BENEFIT WHEN THE POWER

02:04:40.139 --> 02:04:42.374

LITTLE FURTHER ON ALL ISSUES OF

02:04:58.557 --> 02:05:00.092
MITIGATION.

WHETHER IT'S UNDER FUNDING WHEN

02:05:05.231 --> 02:05:06.365

LOST THEIR HOME AND THEY HAD --

02:05:19.812 --> 02:05:21.480
MORE AGGRESSIVE HOME PARTIES IN

02:05:21.547 --> 02:05:22.414
IS IN AND THEN SOME NEIGHBORS

02:05:22.481 --> 02:05:24.850
DID -- BACK IN THE EIGHTIES.

I AND NOW WE'RE GONNA ASSN TO BE

02:05:26.518 --> 02:05:27.786
ABLE TO REBUILD.

02:05:27.853 --> 02:05:29.355
POTENTIALLY WITH.

02:05:29.421 --> 02:05:32.958
HIGHER STANDARDS AGAIN.

02:05:33.025 --> 02:05:34.960
HOW DO YOU SEE THIS PLANE NOW?

02:05:35.027 --> 02:05:36.428
ARMED WITH THOSE FOLKS WHO MAY

02:05:36.495 --> 02:05:39.398
NOT BE ABLE TO AFFORD -- AND

02:05:39.465 --> 02:05:40.933
THEN THE OTHER PIECES -- HOW DO

02:05:41.000 --> 02:05:42.568
YOU SEE THIS PLAYING OUT?

02:05:42.635 --> 02:05:44.103
RELATED TO FOLKS WHO HAVEN'T

02:05:44.169 --> 02:05:45.504
BEEN HIT BY FIRE BUT CAN'T GET

02:05:45.571 --> 02:05:49.041
INSURANCE.

02:05:49.108 --> 02:05:49.942
SO.

02:05:50.009 --> 02:05:52.978
I I GUESS.

02:05:53.045 --> 02:05:54.613
THE LET ME RESPOND TO THE

02:05:54.680 --> 02:05:55.614
QUESTIONS IN TURN.

02:05:55.681 --> 02:05:58.851
THE CHALLENGE FOR FOLKS IN

02:05:58.918 --> 02:06:00.486
CALIFORNIA THAT ARE LIVING IN

02:06:00.552 --> 02:06:02.021
COMMUNITIES YOU KNOW THAT HAVE

02:06:02.087 --> 02:06:04.323
BEEN HIT BY FIRE OR HAVEN'T BEEN

02:06:04.390 --> 02:06:04.924
HIT BY FIRE YET.

02:06:04.990 --> 02:06:07.092
BUT WANT TO DO THE RIGHT THING

02:06:07.159 --> 02:06:08.661
BUT LIVE IN OLDER HOUSING STOCK.

02:06:08.727 --> 02:06:10.963
IS ENORMOUS YEAH AND I THINK THE

02:06:11.030 --> 02:06:13.866
STATE HAS A ROLE TO PLAY NOT

02:06:13.933 --> 02:06:16.535
NECESSARILY IN PAIN.

02:06:16.602 --> 02:06:18.237
FOR THE THE IMPROVEMENTS THAT

02:06:18.304 --> 02:06:19.605
NEED TO BE MADE BUT IT AT LEAST

02:06:19.672 --> 02:06:21.774
PERHAPS IN FINANCING AND

02:06:21.840 --> 02:06:23.275
ASSISTING.

02:06:23.342 --> 02:06:26.312
THOSE -- HOMEOWNERS TO TO AFFORD

02:06:26.378 --> 02:06:27.513
THE KINDS OF INVESTMENTS AND AND

02:06:27.579 --> 02:06:28.814
THE INVESTMENTS ARE NOT MASSIVE

02:06:28.881 --> 02:06:30.749
REYES.

02:06:30.816 --> 02:06:32.518
TO ASPHALT ROOF.

02:06:32.584 --> 02:06:33.886
COVERED EVE'S IT OUT BETTER

02:06:33.953 --> 02:06:36.388
VANCE IN A MASH IN IN THE VANCE --

02:06:36.455 --> 02:06:37.923
AND AND THEN CREATION OF

02:06:37.990 --> 02:06:39.625
SENSIBLE SPACE.

02:06:39.692 --> 02:06:41.060
BUT MANY PEOPLE.

02:06:41.126 --> 02:06:43.162
CAN'T AFFORD EVEN THAT.

02:06:43.228 --> 02:06:45.297
AND SO THERE IS A ROLE AND I

02:06:45.364 --> 02:06:47.466
THINK FOR STATE ASSISTANCE THERE --

02:06:47.533 --> 02:06:53.706
THE ON THE INSURANCE QUESTION.

02:06:53.772 --> 02:06:55.407
YEAH I I THINK THERE ARE NOT

02:06:55.474 --> 02:06:57.676
SIMPLE ANSWERS HERE OTHER THAN

02:06:57.743 --> 02:07:00.646
THE KIND OF VERY LARGE PROGRAM.

02:07:00.713 --> 02:07:02.214
THAT.

02:07:02.281 --> 02:07:05.351
BOB WE'VE DISCUSSED UP THE

02:07:05.417 --> 02:07:06.552
INSURANCE SITUATION IN

02:07:06.618 --> 02:07:09.088
CALIFORNIA IS WHAT WE DESCRIBE

02:07:09.154 --> 02:07:11.223
IN THE REPORT AS FRAGILE -- IT'S

02:07:11.290 --> 02:07:12.791
DIFFICULT TO GET GOOD

02:07:12.858 --> 02:07:14.760
INFORMATION ABOUT WHAT IS GOING

02:07:14.827 --> 02:07:16.528
ON SO MUCH OF THE INFORMATION

02:07:16.595 --> 02:07:18.397
ABOUT NON RENEWALS AT THIS POINT

02:07:18.464 --> 02:07:20.466
IS REALLY ANECDOTAL -- BUT

02:07:20.532 --> 02:07:22.701
CONCERNING VERY CONCERNING

02:07:22.768 --> 02:07:23.002
[inaudible]

02:07:23.068 --> 02:07:28.307
AND THE THE BIG QUESTION THAT I

02:07:28.374 --> 02:07:30.309
HAVE IS HOW.

02:07:30.376 --> 02:07:32.011
YOU KNOW I MENTIONED --

02:07:32.077 --> 02:07:35.781
REINSURANCE AS AN ISSUE THE THE

02:07:35.848 --> 02:07:37.683
ABILITY OF CALIFORNIA.

02:07:37.750 --> 02:07:38.984
SURE IT'S RISK.

02:07:39.051 --> 02:07:40.419
OUTSIDE THE BORDERS IS VERY

02:07:40.486 --> 02:07:42.054
IMPORTANT FOR MAKING INSURANCE

02:07:42.121 --> 02:07:44.089
AFFORDABLE WITHIN THE BORDERS OF

02:07:44.156 --> 02:07:44.356
THE STATE.

02:07:44.423 --> 02:07:47.793
AND THE FOLKS YOU KNOW IN

02:07:47.860 --> 02:07:48.627
BERMUDA.

02:07:48.694 --> 02:07:51.730
REALLY THAT OFFER US COVERAGE

02:07:51.797 --> 02:07:52.931
FOR WILDFIRE.

02:07:52.998 --> 02:07:54.767
ARE GETTING VERY NERVOUS.

02:07:54.833 --> 02:07:57.736
AND I WORRY THAT.

02:07:57.803 --> 02:08:00.172
WE WILL FIND A HARDENING OF THAT

02:08:00.239 --> 02:08:02.474
MARKET LEADING TO A HARDENING OF

02:08:02.541 --> 02:08:03.575
THE HOME INTEREST MARKET WITHIN

02:08:03.642 --> 02:08:04.143
THE STATE.

02:08:04.209 --> 02:08:06.712
AND IT THIS WILL SPREAD BY

02:08:06.779 --> 02:08:10.549
BEYOND -- THERE ARE.

02:08:10.616 --> 02:08:11.984
IT DEPENDS ON HOW YOU COUNT THEM

02:08:12.051 --> 02:08:13.952
BUT THERE ARE ABOUT A MILLION

02:08:14.019 --> 02:08:16.388
HOMES IN CALIFORNIA OUT OF

02:08:16.455 --> 02:08:17.456
TWELVE MILLION.

02:08:17.523 --> 02:08:19.425
THAT ARE AND SEVERE.

02:08:19.491 --> 02:08:21.860
HAZARD ZONES THERE ABOUT THREE

02:08:21.927 --> 02:08:23.362
AND A HALF MILLION IN THE WE WE

02:08:23.429 --> 02:08:24.997
GENERALLY.

02:08:25.064 --> 02:08:27.166
THAT'S A LOT OF HOUSING STOCK.

02:08:27.232 --> 02:08:28.333
THE COULD FACE A REAL CRISIS IN

02:08:28.400 --> 02:08:31.136
TERMS OF ABILITY TO NOT DEFAULT

02:08:31.203 --> 02:08:33.439
ON A MORTGAGE OR ABILITY TO SELL.

02:08:33.505 --> 02:08:35.340
IF -- TO A NEW BUYER WHO WOULD

02:08:35.407 --> 02:08:37.242
HAVE TO ACQUIRE INSURANCE THEY

02:08:37.309 --> 02:08:38.210
ACTUALLY RIGHT I THINK THAT IN

02:08:38.277 --> 02:08:40.412
YOU'D MENTIONED RAIN COUNTY

02:08:40.479 --> 02:08:42.681
BRING COUNTY YOU'RE SEEN ENTIRE

02:08:42.748 --> 02:08:44.416
SWATHS OF CITIES.

02:08:44.483 --> 02:08:45.818
AT HOMEOWNERS WHO ARE AN

02:08:45.884 --> 02:08:47.019
INCORPORATED CITY.

02:08:47.086 --> 02:08:48.620
OUR CHALLENGE TO BE ABLE TO

02:08:48.687 --> 02:08:50.189
PURCHASE TRADITIONAL LAKE COUNTY

02:08:50.255 --> 02:08:52.524
IS A WHOLE NOTHER UNIVERSE WHERE --

02:08:52.591 --> 02:08:54.159
ENTIRE COMMUNITIES.

02:08:54.226 --> 02:08:57.229
I THINK THE OTHER CHALLENGE THAT

02:08:57.296 --> 02:08:58.297
WE HAVE IS THERE IS.

02:08:58.363 --> 02:08:59.198
ISN'T A GRACE ABILITY TO COLLECT

02:08:59.264 --> 02:09:00.432
THE DATA TO BE ABLE TO SEE THE

02:09:00.499 --> 02:09:01.567
HARD NUMBERS OF THOSE WHO ARE

02:09:01.633 --> 02:09:03.068
BEING NON RENEWED.

02:09:03.135 --> 02:09:04.236
I AND I KNOW WE NEED TO TREAD

02:09:04.303 --> 02:09:05.237
LIGHTLY ON THAT BASE OF A

02:09:05.304 --> 02:09:07.005
PROPOSITION BUT SIMPLY BEING

02:09:07.072 --> 02:09:08.941
ABLE TO SEE -- PERCENTAGES I

02:09:09.007 --> 02:09:09.908
KNOW THAT SOME THAT WE'RE

02:09:09.975 --> 02:09:12.678
LOOKING AT OF BASED OFF THE ZIP

02:09:12.744 --> 02:09:13.178
CODE.

02:09:13.245 --> 02:09:16.582
OF WHO IS RECEIVING NUMBER NO

02:09:16.648 --> 02:09:17.249
ONE KNOWS I THINK IT'S GONNA BE

02:09:17.316 --> 02:09:18.417
IMPORTANT SO THAT WERE ABLE TO

02:09:18.484 --> 02:09:21.186
SEE REALLY WHAT THAT LIABILITY

02:09:21.253 --> 02:09:22.721
IS.

02:09:22.788 --> 02:09:23.455
I AUTHORS ANY DISCUSSION ABOUT

02:09:23.522 --> 02:09:24.256
THAT BECAUSE IT'S IT'S HARD TO

02:09:24.323 --> 02:09:26.325
BE TO GET THE ACTUAL HARD DATA I

02:09:26.391 --> 02:09:27.893
COMPLETELY AGREE AND THAT'S ONE

02:09:27.960 --> 02:09:31.196
OF THE REASONS THAT WE SUGGEST

02:09:31.263 --> 02:09:32.564
THE NUMBER OF DATA CALLS.

02:09:32.631 --> 02:09:33.499
ARE FROM THE CALIFORNIA

02:09:33.565 --> 02:09:35.767
APARTMENT INSURANCE AND

02:09:35.834 --> 02:09:38.704
INSURANCE CHAPTER OF OUR REPORT.

02:09:38.770 --> 02:09:40.672
THANK YOU SO MUCH THANK YOU.

02:09:40.739 --> 02:09:42.808
IT SEEMS TO ME THAT THE VICTIMS

02:09:42.875 --> 02:09:44.776
WEALTH FIRE VICTIMS FUND IS

02:09:44.843 --> 02:09:47.045
SUPERIOR TO LIQUIDITY.

02:09:47.112 --> 02:09:48.814
FIVE BECAUSE ONE OF THE REASONS

02:09:48.881 --> 02:09:50.182
OBVIOUSLY HAVE AN INTEREST IN.

02:09:50.249 --> 02:09:53.252
HELPING FOR ASSISTING P. GENIE

02:09:53.318 --> 02:09:55.587
TO HELP ITSELF EMERGE FROM

02:09:55.654 --> 02:09:57.089
BANKRUPTCY IN YOUR AND WE'RE

02:09:57.156 --> 02:09:58.657
TRYING TO IMPROVE.

02:09:58.724 --> 02:10:00.826
SOLVENCY OF ALL OF ALL --

02:10:00.893 --> 02:10:03.762
UTILITIES IN IN THE WAY WE DO

02:10:03.829 --> 02:10:06.899
THAT IS WE TRY.

02:10:06.965 --> 02:10:08.600
TO REDUCE THE LOOK OR MINIMIZE

02:10:08.667 --> 02:10:11.937
THE THE LIABILITIES IN ORDER TO

02:10:12.004 --> 02:10:13.038
INVEST WERE.

02:10:13.105 --> 02:10:15.073
ATTRACT CAPITAL IN THE

02:10:15.140 --> 02:10:17.676
BANKRUPTCY THAT WILL ALLOW.

02:10:17.743 --> 02:10:19.344
A PLAN THAT WILL ASK FOR NEW

02:10:19.411 --> 02:10:21.380
MONEY TO COME IN AND THAT MONEY

02:10:21.446 --> 02:10:22.948
IS NOT GONNA COME IN UNLESS WE

02:10:23.015 --> 02:10:24.883
DO SOMETHING ON THE MITIGATION

02:10:24.950 --> 02:10:26.518
HARDENING AND ALL THAT BUT ALSO

02:10:26.585 --> 02:10:28.253
LIMIT THE CAPITAL BECAUSE THERE

02:10:28.320 --> 02:10:29.955
ARE FORTY NINE OTHER STATES THAT.

02:10:30.022 --> 02:10:32.958
THAT CAPITAL FUNDS CAN PUT THEIR

02:10:33.025 --> 02:10:33.992
MONEY INTO AND GET THEIR 10%.

02:10:34.059 --> 02:10:36.528
RETURN ON INVESTMENT -- IT SO IF

02:10:36.595 --> 02:10:39.431
WE DON'T TAKE CARE OF THAT PIECE

02:10:39.498 --> 02:10:40.832
IT SEEMS LIKE.

02:10:40.899 --> 02:10:44.169
OUR WERE JUST -- INVITING THESE

02:10:44.236 --> 02:10:49.041
ARE THE UTILITIES. TWO YOU KNOW

02:10:49.107 --> 02:10:50.175
THE FAULT OR ENTER INTO

02:10:50.242 --> 02:10:51.410
BANKRUPTCY TO DEAL WITH THIS

02:10:51.476 --> 02:10:53.912
UNCERTAINTY ON THE ON THE

02:10:53.979 --> 02:10:55.514
LIABILITY PIECE IN MY GETTING

02:10:55.581 --> 02:10:58.217
THIS WRONG [inaudible]

02:10:58.283 --> 02:11:06.491
WELL -- THE THING TO REMEMBER.

02:11:06.558 --> 02:11:11.630
IS THAT WHILE A LARGER FIND.

02:11:11.697 --> 02:11:12.831
WELL CREATE A YOU KNOW ON AN

02:11:12.898 --> 02:11:15.033
INSURANCE POLICY AS OPPOSED --

02:11:15.100 --> 02:11:17.002
TO A BRIDGE LOAN IT'S A LOT MORE

02:11:17.069 --> 02:11:18.437
EXPENSIVE.

02:11:18.503 --> 02:11:20.839
BOB AND IF NOTHING IS FREE IN

02:11:20.906 --> 02:11:22.374
THIS CONVERSATION.

02:11:22.441 --> 02:11:25.010
SO -- YES I THINK IT WOULD

02:11:25.077 --> 02:11:26.411
CREATE GREATER CERTAINTY BUT AT

02:11:26.478 --> 02:11:27.846
A GREATER COST.

02:11:27.913 --> 02:11:30.148
AND THE QUESTION IS -- YOU KNOW

02:11:30.215 --> 02:11:31.516
IS IS IS IS IS IT IN THE

02:11:31.583 --> 02:11:33.085
INTERESTS OF THE STATE GIVEN

02:11:33.151 --> 02:11:36.555
THAT COST TO CREATE.

02:11:36.622 --> 02:11:38.323
A FIND OF THE SCALE THAT WE'RE

02:11:38.390 --> 02:11:39.558
TALKING ABOUT SUFFICIENT TO

02:11:39.625 --> 02:11:42.394
MANAGE THIS RISK. TO GET TO A

02:11:42.461 --> 02:11:45.664
HEART INTEGRATED -- AND I THINK

02:11:45.731 --> 02:11:47.532
THE ANSWER DEPENDS ON IT DEPENDS

02:11:47.599 --> 02:11:49.001
ESPECIALLY ON WHO IS PAYING THAT

02:11:49.067 --> 02:11:50.969
LARGER COST.

02:11:51.036 --> 02:11:52.704
RIGHT I MEAN A CERTAIN CERTAINLY

02:11:52.771 --> 02:11:55.140
THE CALIFORNIA CALIFORNIA HAS A

02:11:55.207 --> 02:11:55.774
PORTION OF IT BUT WE'RE TALKING

02:11:55.841 --> 02:11:58.910
ABOUT P. JEANNIE VOLUNTARILY --

02:11:58.977 --> 02:12:00.379
CONTRIBUTING TO THE TO THE FUN

02:12:00.445 --> 02:12:02.447
EN EN THE ONLY WAY THEY'RE GOING

02:12:02.514 --> 02:12:03.582
TO DO THAT IS A YEAR IF THEY

02:12:03.649 --> 02:12:05.083
ATTRACT THE CAPITAL MARKETS IF

02:12:05.150 --> 02:12:06.518
THEY LOOK AND THEY SAY WE WANT

02:12:06.585 --> 02:12:08.053
TO PLAY BALL WITH CALIFORNIA NOW

02:12:08.120 --> 02:12:09.521
BECAUSE THEY'VE DONE.

02:12:09.588 --> 02:12:12.491
ALL THESE RECOMMENDATIONS THAT

02:12:12.557 --> 02:12:14.426
YOU COME IN WELL THAT'S IT IT'S

02:12:14.493 --> 02:12:15.961
A VOLUNTARY ACTION BY PEACHY

02:12:16.028 --> 02:12:17.496
NEED THE SIGNALS TO THE CAPITAL

02:12:17.562 --> 02:12:19.064
MARKET IS THAT IS THAT WE'RE

02:12:19.131 --> 02:12:20.165
GOING TO PUT.

02:12:20.232 --> 02:12:22.334
A CAP ON DAMAGES LET'S JUST SAY

02:12:22.401 --> 02:12:23.969
WHAT IT IS THERE'S GONNA BE IT

02:12:24.036 --> 02:12:25.570
HOWEVER WE SLICE OF THIS PIE

02:12:25.637 --> 02:12:27.906
WE'RE GOING TO PUT A CAP ON

02:12:27.973 --> 02:12:29.207
DAMAGES AND THEY SAY OKAY.

02:12:29.274 --> 02:12:31.810
MY MONEY IS WORTH AS MUCH IN

02:12:31.877 --> 02:12:34.046
CALIFORNIA AS IT IS IN TEXAS OR

02:12:34.112 --> 02:12:35.314
IN RHODE ISLAND WHEREVER ELSE

02:12:35.380 --> 02:12:37.149
THE CAPITAL MARKETS INVEST

02:12:37.215 --> 02:12:39.751
INVESTORS AND THEN THE THE THE

02:12:39.818 --> 02:12:41.019
DEBTOR IN POSSESSION AT LEAST IN

02:12:41.086 --> 02:12:42.721
THE P. GENIE IS GOING TO SAY WE

02:12:42.788 --> 02:12:43.288
WANT.

02:12:43.355 --> 02:12:44.556
TO WE WANT TO EMERGE FROM

02:12:44.623 --> 02:12:46.291
BANKRUPTCY WE WE HAVE THE

02:12:46.358 --> 02:12:50.429
CERTAINTY NOW THE CALIFORNIA HAS.

02:12:50.495 --> 02:12:51.096
PRESCRIBED FOR US WITH THIS THIS

02:12:51.163 --> 02:12:52.731
PLAN THAT WE CAN ASK THE CAPITAL

02:12:52.798 --> 02:12:55.000
MARKETS PUT MORE VALUE INTO THE

02:12:55.067 --> 02:12:56.902
THE NEW DEBTOR AND WILL EMERGE

02:12:56.968 --> 02:12:58.270
AND THEN WE WILL.

02:12:58.337 --> 02:13:00.672
VOLUNTARILY PARTICIPATING YOU'RE

02:13:00.739 --> 02:13:02.040
OUT WILDFIRE FITNESS OF I DON'T

02:13:02.107 --> 02:13:08.013
SEE HOW ANY OTHER WAY TO DO IT.

02:13:08.080 --> 02:13:11.883
IT IS HARD TO SEE A SUSTAINABLE.

02:13:11.950 --> 02:13:12.851
SO.

02:13:12.918 --> 02:13:14.186
THE CAPITAL MARKETS HAVE

02:13:14.252 --> 02:13:15.554
CONCLUDED THAT THE CAPITAL

02:13:15.620 --> 02:13:17.189
MARKETS AGREE WITH YOU SENATOR

02:13:17.255 --> 02:13:19.991
CASKEY THEY DO NOT SEE RIGHT NOW

02:13:20.058 --> 02:13:21.360
SUSTAINABLE BUSINESS MODEL.

02:13:21.426 --> 02:13:23.528
BOB IN THE UTILITY SPACE IN

02:13:23.595 --> 02:13:25.063
CALIFORNIA BECAUSE OF WHAT THEY

02:13:25.130 --> 02:13:26.598
PERCEIVE AS I'M ON LIMITED

02:13:26.665 --> 02:13:27.866
DOWNSIDE RISK.

02:13:27.933 --> 02:13:29.034
AND DID THAT THERE COULD THEY

02:13:29.101 --> 02:13:30.369
COULD WAKE UP YOU COULD INVEST

02:13:30.435 --> 02:13:31.236
TEN DOLLARS IN CALIFORNIA YOU

02:13:31.303 --> 02:13:32.771
COULD WAKE UP ON SUNDAY IN

02:13:32.838 --> 02:13:34.406
SEPTEMBER AND FIND THAT THAT TEN

02:13:34.473 --> 02:13:36.341
DOLLARS IS WORTH ONE DOLLAR --

02:13:36.408 --> 02:13:41.346
SO.

02:13:41.413 --> 02:13:41.847
WE NEED TO CHANGE THAT

02:13:41.913 --> 02:13:42.981
PERCEPTION.

02:13:43.048 --> 02:13:45.283
AT THE MINIMUM COST TO RATE

02:13:45.350 --> 02:13:47.052
PAYERS AND TO VICTIMS.

02:13:47.119 --> 02:13:51.089
AND I THINK THE UTILITIES AND

02:13:51.156 --> 02:13:52.591
THEIR SHAREHOLDERS AND THEIR

02:13:52.657 --> 02:13:54.659
BOND HOLDERS HAVE AN ENORMOUS

02:13:54.726 --> 02:13:56.161
INTEREST IN SEEING THAT PROBLEM

02:13:56.228 --> 02:13:57.863
SOLVED AS WELL.

02:13:57.929 --> 02:13:58.497
AND WE SHOULD ALL CONTRIBUTE TO

02:13:58.563 --> 02:14:04.669
A SOLUTION.

02:14:04.736 --> 02:14:07.939
I THINK ARE INVERSE CONDEMNATION

02:14:08.006 --> 02:14:10.675
IS WAS A LOVELY CONCEPT IN THE

02:14:10.742 --> 02:14:11.843
NINETEENTH CENTURY WHEN WE

02:14:11.910 --> 02:14:13.712
THOUGHT THAT SPREADING THE RISK

02:14:13.779 --> 02:14:15.580
AROUND MEANT PUTTING IT ON TO

02:14:15.647 --> 02:14:16.782
THE THE RATE PAYERS.

02:14:16.848 --> 02:14:17.949
WE'RE NOW IN THE TWENTY FIRST

02:14:18.016 --> 02:14:20.419
CENTURY AND WE HAVE EMINENT

02:14:20.485 --> 02:14:22.587
DOMAIN WE HAVE EASEMENTS AND WE

02:14:22.654 --> 02:14:23.855
HAVE.

02:14:23.922 --> 02:14:25.824
INVERSE CONDEMNATION VAN THAT WE

02:14:25.891 --> 02:14:28.126
ALL LEARNED IN IN LAW SCHOOL BUT

02:14:28.193 --> 02:14:29.728
THE CLIMATE.

02:14:29.795 --> 02:14:31.029
I CHANGES AND ALL THESE OTHER

02:14:31.096 --> 02:14:33.298
FACTORS HAVE REALLY CHANGED THAT

02:14:33.365 --> 02:14:35.400
VARIABLE AND WE'VE TALKED AROUND

02:14:35.467 --> 02:14:38.370
AND ROUND OF WITH SPREADING THAT

02:14:38.437 --> 02:14:39.838
SOCIALIZING THAT WRIST YOU HAVE

02:14:39.905 --> 02:14:42.407
ANY IDEAS AT LEAST IN THE IN THE

02:14:42.474 --> 02:14:43.842
LAW OF HOW WE MAY.

02:14:43.909 --> 02:14:46.378
REDEFINE WHAT IT MEANS TO HAVE

02:14:46.445 --> 02:14:47.379
UTILITIES.

02:14:47.446 --> 02:14:50.882
OUR POLLS ON YOUR PROPERTY IN A

02:14:50.949 --> 02:14:54.052
IN AN EASEMENT INVERSE --

02:14:54.119 --> 02:15:01.159
EMINENT DOMAIN -- WORLD -- I

02:15:01.226 --> 02:15:05.397
THINK THERE ARE.

02:15:05.464 --> 02:15:07.098
WHAT I WOULD SAY IS THAT

02:15:07.165 --> 02:15:07.399
[inaudible]

02:15:07.466 --> 02:15:09.901
IF.

02:15:09.968 --> 02:15:12.003
INVERSE CONDEMNATION STAYS AS IT

02:15:12.070 --> 02:15:14.172
IS.

02:15:14.239 --> 02:15:19.911
ARE THERE IS A TREMENDOUS REWARD.

02:15:19.978 --> 02:15:21.847
FOR CREATIVE LAWYERS WHO

02:15:21.913 --> 02:15:23.415
CREATIVE PROPERTY LAWYERS WHO

02:15:23.482 --> 02:15:27.052
CAN THINK UP NEW WAYS TO SOLVE

02:15:27.118 --> 02:15:28.854
THE KIND OF NETWORK PROBLEMS.

02:15:28.920 --> 02:15:31.823
THAT UTILITIES HAVE HISTORICALLY

02:15:31.890 --> 02:15:40.365
SALT USING EASEMENTS.

02:15:40.432 --> 02:15:41.032
I'M USING UTILITY LINES MEN'S IN

02:15:41.099 --> 02:15:42.234
ANOTHER WAY THAT DOESN'T INVOLVE

02:15:42.300 --> 02:15:43.468
CONDEMNATION -- AND DOESN'T

02:15:43.535 --> 02:15:45.036
DOESN'T THEREFORE CREATE THIS

02:15:45.103 --> 02:15:46.338
PROBLEM.

02:15:46.404 --> 02:15:47.239
COM I AM NOT SURE WHAT THAT

02:15:47.305 --> 02:15:48.406
SOLUTION LOOKS LIKE -- BUT I

02:15:48.473 --> 02:15:50.175
IMAGINE THAT THERE ARE YOU KNOW

02:15:50.242 --> 02:15:50.375
THAT.

02:15:50.442 --> 02:15:51.343
THERE ARE [inaudible]

02:15:51.409 --> 02:15:52.777
IN PRACTICE.

02:15:52.844 --> 02:15:55.313
UTILITIES STRIVE TO AVOID

02:15:55.380 --> 02:15:57.916
CONDEMNING PROPERTY THEY TRY TO

02:15:57.983 --> 02:15:59.718
REACH AGREEMENTS SETTLEMENTS

02:15:59.784 --> 02:16:02.053
THAT DON'T INVOLVE ACTUAL USE OF

02:16:02.120 --> 02:16:04.389
EMINENT DOMAIN AUTHORITY --

02:16:04.456 --> 02:16:06.324
THERE ARE PROBABLY OTHER

02:16:06.391 --> 02:16:08.260
CONTRACTUAL MODELS THAT WOULD

02:16:08.326 --> 02:16:10.495
AVOID THE INVERSE CONDEMNATION

02:16:10.562 --> 02:16:12.898
DOCTRINE THE PROBLEM IS THAT WE

02:16:12.964 --> 02:16:14.466
HAVE THE SYSTEM WE HAVE.

02:16:14.533 --> 02:16:16.067
AND IT'S BEEN BUILT USING THE

02:16:16.134 --> 02:16:18.103
POWER OF EMINENT DOMAIN AND SO

02:16:18.169 --> 02:16:22.941
SUBJECT TO THE LAW THAT WE HAVE.

02:16:23.008 --> 02:16:24.476
THE CHARGES FOLLOW REQUEST LAST

02:16:24.543 --> 02:16:25.677
WORD SENATOR HERTZBERG AND THEN

02:16:25.744 --> 02:16:27.579
WE'RE GOING TO PUBLIC COMMENT.

02:16:27.646 --> 02:16:28.647
ON CENTER RECOUNTS THESE

02:16:28.713 --> 02:16:29.314
COMMENTS BECAUSE I WANT TO BUILD

02:16:29.381 --> 02:16:30.148
ON THAT BECAUSE I THINK YOU

02:16:30.215 --> 02:16:32.817
TOUCHED A NERVE HERE.

02:16:32.884 --> 02:16:34.252
THANKS IMPORTANT.

02:16:34.319 --> 02:16:35.820
ON YOU TALKED ABOUT THE COST OF

02:16:35.887 --> 02:16:38.156
THE INSURANCE MODEL VERSUS THE

02:16:38.223 --> 02:16:39.558
BRIDGE THE LOAN MODEL.

02:16:39.624 --> 02:16:40.825
AND NO QUESTION IS MORE

02:16:40.892 --> 02:16:42.427
EXPENSIVE WOULD YOU ASKED THEM

02:16:42.494 --> 02:16:44.429
MOST PROBATIVE QUESTION OF WHO

02:16:44.496 --> 02:16:45.564
PAYS.

02:16:45.630 --> 02:16:47.198
WHEN YOU TALKED EARLIER ABOUT

02:16:47.265 --> 02:16:49.434
ENTERPRISE VALUE WHAT WE HAVE

02:16:49.501 --> 02:16:51.069
HERE IN TERMS OF WHAT'S CLEAR IS

02:16:51.136 --> 02:16:53.471
WE HAVE RATE PAYERS ARE GOING TO

02:16:53.538 --> 02:16:54.105
PAY DOUBLE RETAIL?

02:16:54.172 --> 02:16:56.541
WE HAVE TAXPAYERS ARE GOING TO

02:16:56.608 --> 02:16:58.443
PAY DOUBLE RETAIL BUT WE HAVE

02:16:58.510 --> 02:17:00.612
THIS UNIQUE ENTERPRISE VALUE

02:17:00.679 --> 02:17:02.347
SYSTEM WHERE FOLKS IT

02:17:02.414 --> 02:17:04.215
PARTICULARLY P. JEAN OTHERS ARE

02:17:04.282 --> 02:17:06.318
LOOKING AT THIS WHERE WE KNOW

02:17:06.384 --> 02:17:07.819
WHAT A HEALTHY UTILITY.

02:17:07.886 --> 02:17:09.054
TRADES THAT WE KNOW WHAT OUR

02:17:09.120 --> 02:17:10.355
TRADES THAT WE KNOW WHAT THE

02:17:10.422 --> 02:17:12.390
WHAT THE WAS TRADING AT NOW

02:17:12.457 --> 02:17:13.892
WHETHER IT'S DEBT INSTRUMENTS

02:17:13.959 --> 02:17:15.226
FOR EQUITY INSTRUMENTS.

02:17:15.293 --> 02:17:17.596
THAT PROVIDES AN OPPORTUNITY TO

02:17:17.662 --> 02:17:20.799
TAKE THE COST OFF THE BOOKS OF

02:17:20.865 --> 02:17:23.335
THE RATE PAYERS OR TAX PAYERS.

02:17:23.401 --> 02:17:26.204
IF IT'S ELEGANTLY DRAFTED TO BE

02:17:26.271 --> 02:17:28.173
ABLE TO TO DEAL WITH THIS AND

02:17:28.239 --> 02:17:29.841
THE IDEA OF THE UNLIMITED

02:17:29.908 --> 02:17:31.743
DOWNSIDE RISKS TO WHICH CHORE TO

02:17:31.810 --> 02:17:32.410
CHELATED.

02:17:32.477 --> 02:17:34.145
IS GOING TO BE INFORMED BY AND

02:17:34.212 --> 02:17:36.781
AGGRESSIVE MITIGATION SIX TO ONE

02:17:36.848 --> 02:17:38.483
APPROACH THAT YOU JUST TALKED

02:17:38.550 --> 02:17:40.185
ABOUT THAT COULD BE PRETTY

02:17:40.251 --> 02:17:41.953
DRAMATIC SO I IN TERMS OF

02:17:42.020 --> 02:17:44.356
FIGURING OUT AS THE NINE A ONE

02:17:44.422 --> 02:17:45.857
YOUR COMMISSION TALKED ABOUT.

02:17:45.924 --> 02:17:47.359
OF THESE VERY IS KIND OF

02:17:47.425 --> 02:17:49.494
ELEMENTS WE'RE TRYING TO DO IS

02:17:49.561 --> 02:17:50.762
TO TAKE THOSE THOUGHTFUL

02:17:50.829 --> 02:17:52.430
ELEMENTS AND COBBLED THEM

02:17:52.497 --> 02:17:53.498
TOGETHER.

02:17:53.565 --> 02:17:55.700
IN AN APPROACH THAT DEALS WITH

02:17:55.767 --> 02:17:57.535
THE SENATE JACKSON TALKED ABOUT

02:17:57.602 --> 02:17:58.103
WOULD CENTER NIELSEN TALKED

02:17:58.169 --> 02:17:59.304
ABOUT WASN'T KOWSKI JUST TALKED

02:17:59.371 --> 02:18:00.205
ABOUT.

02:18:00.271 --> 02:18:02.374
INTO A WAY FORWARD AND THE THE

02:18:02.440 --> 02:18:04.509
THE COST ANALYSIS AND WHAT YOUR

02:18:04.576 --> 02:18:06.778
CONFIRMATION ON THIS IF I'M

02:18:06.845 --> 02:18:08.313
RIGHT ON CONFIRMATION IF I'M

02:18:08.380 --> 02:18:10.048
WRONG. TO MEDICALLY CHANGES

02:18:10.115 --> 02:18:12.050
BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT BECAUSE YOU

02:18:12.117 --> 02:18:13.385
HAVE PEOPLE THERE TRADING AT

02:18:13.451 --> 02:18:14.886
DEEP DISCOUNTS WHO DESPERATELY

02:18:14.953 --> 02:18:16.988
WANT TO PROTECT THEIR ASSETS.

02:18:17.055 --> 02:18:18.790
IN AND P. JEANNIE IN PARTICULAR

02:18:18.857 --> 02:18:20.892
AND WITH RESPECT TO THE LARGER

02:18:20.959 --> 02:18:22.460
PICTURE OF US GRADING HEALTHY

02:18:22.527 --> 02:18:23.962
UTILITY MODEL WITH THE WITH THE

02:18:24.029 --> 02:18:25.430
LESSON DOWNSIDE RISKS.

02:18:25.497 --> 02:18:27.432
THAT A GREAT OPPORTUNITY RESTS

02:18:27.499 --> 02:18:29.267
IN CAPTURING THAT ENTERPRISE

02:18:29.334 --> 02:18:36.641
VALUE TO THOSE INSTRUMENTS.

02:18:36.708 --> 02:18:37.676
I THINK THAT'S RIGHT RPG HAS

02:18:37.742 --> 02:18:38.309
SIGNIFICANT LIABILITIES

02:18:38.376 --> 02:18:39.411
OBVIOUSLY BECAUSE OF THE

02:18:39.477 --> 02:18:41.046
PARADISE -- CATASTROPHE.

02:18:41.112 --> 02:18:43.381
AND THE FIRES THAT OCCURRED IN

02:18:43.448 --> 02:18:44.949
NAPA AND SONOMA COUNTIES.

02:18:45.016 --> 02:18:48.353
BY THE REALITY IS THAT.

02:18:48.420 --> 02:18:50.055
I HEALTHY P. JEANNIE WOULD TRADE

02:18:50.121 --> 02:18:52.390
AT MULTIPLES OF ITS CURRENT

02:18:52.457 --> 02:18:53.558
VALUE.

02:18:53.625 --> 02:18:56.594
AND THE FIRMS THAT ARE INVESTING

02:18:56.661 --> 02:18:57.962
P. JEANNIE AT PRESENT ARE NOT

02:18:58.029 --> 02:19:00.131
TRADITIONAL UTILIY INVESTORS

02:19:00.198 --> 02:19:00.799
THEIR HEDGE FUNDS THAT ARE EVENT

02:19:00.865 --> 02:19:01.566
DRIVEN.

02:19:01.633 --> 02:19:03.935
AND ARE LOOKING AT THIS AS A

02:19:04.002 --> 02:19:06.304
OPPORTUNITY WITH SIGNIFICANT

02:19:06.371 --> 02:19:06.838
UPSIDE.

02:19:06.905 --> 02:19:09.474
AND I THINK IT IS REASONABLE TO

02:19:09.541 --> 02:19:11.409
ASK THAT IF THE STATE IS GOING

02:19:11.476 --> 02:19:14.012
TO CREATE THAT UPSIDE FOR THE

02:19:14.079 --> 02:19:15.013
SHAREHOLDERS APPEASING NEEDED TO

02:19:15.080 --> 02:19:17.348
SHAREHOLDERS SHARE SOME OF IT

02:19:17.415 --> 02:19:19.451
WITH THE STATE.

02:19:19.517 --> 02:19:20.218
GET CAPITA SIDE STATUTORILY IN

02:19:20.285 --> 02:19:21.753
TERMS OF THE IDEAS THAT WE WANT

02:19:21.820 --> 02:19:23.188
TO DO WE CAN REQUIRE GREATER

02:19:23.254 --> 02:19:24.122
CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE QUOTE THE

02:19:24.189 --> 02:19:26.091
FUNDS ARE GREATER CONTRIBUTIONS

02:19:26.157 --> 02:19:27.592
TO THE TO THAT WILDFIRE FUNDS

02:19:27.659 --> 02:19:28.993
THE INSURANCE FUND WE COULD

02:19:29.060 --> 02:19:32.797
CREATE A PROCESS TO MAKE SURE

02:19:32.864 --> 02:19:33.364
THAT WERE PROTECTED IN THAT

02:19:33.431 --> 02:19:34.966
REGARD NOW.

02:19:35.033 --> 02:19:36.634
WE YES THE I THINK THE STATE

02:19:36.701 --> 02:19:38.903
COULD CONDITION ACCESS TO

02:19:38.970 --> 02:19:41.039
VARIOUS TOOLS LIKE A WILDFIRE

02:19:41.106 --> 02:19:44.175
FIND OR I DID A OF BETTER.

02:19:44.242 --> 02:19:45.343
FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF A

02:19:45.410 --> 02:19:46.711
SHAREHOLDER BETTER COST RECOVERY

02:19:46.778 --> 02:19:49.514
LOWER RISK COST RECOVERY
