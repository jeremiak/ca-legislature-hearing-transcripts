ALL RIGHT WE'RE NOW GOING TO HEAR SB SIX BY SENATOR DOLE ALSO. POOR POOR FIVE QUARTERLY REPORT FIRST ONE IS START OFF BY THANKING SENATOR RAWSON FOR A HARD WORK ON THIS TOPIC. SCIENCE IS CLEAR THAT EXPOSURE TO FOR HER FIVE OTHER. WITH DAN- FAST A PESTICIDES CAN HAVE SIGNIFICANT MEN WITH NEGATIVE IMPACTS. ESPECIALLY FOR CHILDREN AND DEVELOPING FETUSES. WANT TO THANK YOU FOR KEEPING THIS IMPORTANT TOPIC IN THE SPOTLIGHT. OKAY SENATOR YOU MAY PROCEED WHEN READY. THANK YOU GOOD MORNING- AND THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRPERSON QUIRK AND MEMBERS OF THE OF THE COMMITTEE OF FOR YOUR TIME AND- COMPREHENSIVE ANALYSIS OF THIS BILL SB EIGHTY SIX WILL REQUIRE THE DEPARTMENT OF PESTICIDE REGULATION. TO SUBMIT QUARTERLY REPORTS THAT PROVIDE INFORMATION ON GRANULAR CHLORPYRIFOS USE TO LEGISLATIVE COMMITTEES AND THE OFFICE OF THE SURGEON GENERAL. CALIFORNIA HAS A CRITICAL TO US IN AND SHE THAT FARMER. THE FACT IS ARE PUT. BRISTOL BACK OF EXPOSURE TO HARMFUL PESTICIDES CLEAR PURIFIES IS ACUTELY TOXIC AND ASSOCIATED WITH NEAR DEVELOPMENTAL HARMON CHILDREN. BRING CAN BE EXPOSED TO CHLORPYRIFOS WHEN THEIR PARENTS OR SIBLINGS BRING THE PESTICIDE INTO THE HOME ON THEIR SKIN CLOTHING AND SHOES CHILDREN EXPERIENCE GREATER EXPOSURE TO CHLORPYRIFOS AND OTHER PESTICIDES. BECAUSE RELATIVE TO ADULTS THEY EAT DRINK AND BREATHE MORE IN PROPORTION TO THEIR BODY WEIGHT. MIDDLE AND EARLY LIFE EXPOSURE TO CHLORPYRIFOS IS ASSOCIATED WITH ELEVATED RISKS A REDUCED IQ LOSS OF WORKING MEMORY DELAYS AND MOTOR DEVELOPMENT ATTENTION DEFICIT DISORDERS AND STRUCTURAL CHANGES IN THE BRAIN. OCTOBER NINTH TWENTY NINE EIGHTEEN THE DEPARTMENT OF PESTICIDE REGULATION ANNOUNCED THAT IT HAD REACHED A LEGAL SETTLEMENT WITH CHLORPYRIFOS REGISTRANTS WERE BY. SALES OF CERTAIN CHLORPYRIFOS PRODUCTS WOULD END BY FEBRUARY TWENTY TWENTY THE DEPARTMENT CLARIFIED THAT PRODUCTS THAT APPLY FOR PEER FUSS AND ITS GRANULAR FORM WOULD BE ALLOWED TO REMAIN ON THE MARKET. THE P. R. AND THE DEEP CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF FOOD AND AGRICULTURE CREATED A CLEAR PAYER FALSE ALTERNATIVES WORKGROUP TO IDENTIFY EVALUATE AND RECOMMEND TURNED IT MATTER SALUTE. IN THERE JUST A CLIPPER A SEARCH CORPORATE FOST THANKS THE DPRK KNOWLEDGE THAT IT ONLY CONSIDERED SPRAY DRIFT DIETARY EXT JUST CLICK. DPR DID NOT EVALUATE THE WAYS THE GRANULAR CHLORPYRIFOS CAN HARM WORK. ON THE OTHER IN TWENTY AND IT'S TWENTY SIXTEEN ASSESSMENT THE UNITED STATES ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY CONSIDERED OVER SEVENTY USES OF GRAND CHLORPYRIFOS. THAT FEDERAL AGENCY CONCLUDED THAT ALL OF THESE USES PRESENT RISKS OF CONCERN TO FARMWORKERS EVEN WHEN PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT IS WORN. NOW I WOULD LIKE TO DISCUSS DEEP YARDS CURRENT REPORTING REQUIREMENTS I WANT TO EMPHASIZE THAT SB EIGHTY SIX FITS WITHIN DPR IS EXISTING INFRASTRUCTURE FOR REPORTING PESTICIDE USE. THE DPR IS REQUIRED TO BE PART ANNUAL REPORTS OF PESTICIDE USE AND QUARTERLY REPORTS A RESTRICTED. SIDE YOU. THE MOST RECENT ANNUAL REPORT THAT WE CAN ACCESS IS THE TWENTY SEVENTEEN REPORT THIS IS UNACCEPTABLE THE PUBLIC NEEDS TO KNOW THE INFORMATION THAT IS AVAILABLE IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN AND TWENTY TEN REPORTS. IN TERMS OF RESTRICTED PESTICIDE SUCH AS GRANULAR CHLORPYRIFOS ALL COUNTY AGRICULTURAL COMMISSIONS ARE REQUIRED TO SUBMIT RESTRICTED PESTICIDE USE REPORTS TO THE DPR. THE COUNTY AGRICULTURE COMMISSIONERS ARE REQUIRED TO SUBMIT THESE REPORTS MONTHLY. THEN THE DPR DIRECTOR IS REQUIRED TO SUMMARIZE THE DATA ON THE TYPE OF MATERIAL AN AMOUNT ON A QUARTERLY BASIS THESE SUMMARIES SHALL BE MADE AVAILABLE. BUT THE DPR DIRECTOR HAS THE DISCRETION WHETHER OR NOT THE PUBLISH OR DISTRIBUTE THE SUMMARIES FOR THE MORE EVEN THE CHLORPYRIFOS ALTERNATIVES WORKGROUP. WE COMMEND BOARDING FOSS USE AND SHARE THIS INFORMATION WITH THE PUBLIC SB EIGHTY SIX FOLLOWS THAT RECOMMEND. BEING OF CHANGE. AND THAT'S NOT AVAILABLE ON A REPORTS. SB EIGHTY SIX REQUIRES A DEEP YARD TO PROVIDE CORD REPORT AND THEN SUBMIT IT IS TWO SIX IS COMMITTEE INCLUDED BECAUSE OF THE SURGEON GENERAL. I'M THE BILL GIVES THE PR SIXTY DAYS. WE NEED GREATER TRANSPARENCY OVER THE USE OF GRANULAR CHLORPYRIFOS THIS INFORMATION MUST BE ACCESSIBLE TO THE PUBLIC ESPECIALLY PEOPLE LIKE FARMWORKERS ALL WE WANT IS TO TRACK THE USE A GRANULAR USES OUR CORE PEER FOSS AND IT'S HEALTH IMPACTS ON FARMWORKERS. FINALLY I JUST WANT TO END WITH THE WORDS OF SAYS OUR JOB IS THE CO FOUNDER OF THE UNITED FARM WORKERS UNION AFTER HIS LAST UNCONDITIONAL WATER ONLY FAST. IF GROWERS ARE CHEMICAL COMPANIES CAN SHOW THAT STANDARDS PROTECTING PEOPLE WILL COST MORE THAN THEY BENEFIT. THEY CAN GET OFF THE HOOK. UNDER COST BENEFIT STANDARDS ACOSTA PESTICIDE SAFETY ARE QUANTIFIABLE LIKE THE MONEY CHEMICAL COMPANIES INVEST IN PRODUCING PESTICIDES OR IN THE STOCK OF TOXICS THAT HAVE ALREADY BEEN MANUFACTURED. PROPS GROUPS CLASS BE ENDANGERED IF SOME PESTICIDES ARE BOUND. THE BENEFITS OF PESTICIDE PROTECTION ESPECIALLY LONG TERM CHRONIC THREATS TO FARMWORKERS AND CONSUMERS ARE IMPOSSIBLE TO EXPRESS IN DOLLARS AND CENTS THEY ARE OFTEN CONTAINED AT BEST IN VAGUE STUDIES THANKS TO THE GROWERS AND CHEMICAL COMPANIES ARE RESISTED TESTING FOR HELP TO FIX. SO THEY DON'T BÃ N THE WORST OF THESE POISONS BECAUSE SOME FORMER FOR MY GIVE BIRTH TO A DEFORMED CHILD SO THEY DON'T BAN IN- THEY DON'T IMPERIL MILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN PROFITS TODAY BECAUSE SOME DAYS SOME CONSUMER MIGHT GET CANCER. SO THEY ALLOW ALL OF US WHO PLACE OUR FAITH AND THE SAFETY OF THE FOOD CHAIN TO CONSUME GRAPES AND OTHER PRODUCE WHICH CONTAIN RESIDUES FROM PESTICIDES CARD K. SIR AND BIRTH DEFECTS. SO WE ACCEPT DECADES OF ENVIRONMENTAL DAMAGE THAT'S BEEN BROUGHT UPON THE LAND. I'M SORRY I'M SORRY. THE GROWERS CHEMICAL COMPANIES AND OTHERS SAY THESE ARE ACCEPTABLE LEVELS OF EXPOSURE BUT ACCEPTABLE TO HOME ACCEPTABLE TO FARMWORKERS AND THEIR SONS AND DAUGHTERS WHO HAVE KNOWN TRAGEDY FROM PESTICIDES THERE IS NO ACCEPTABLE LEVEL EXPOSURE TO ANY CHEMICAL THAT CAUSES CANCER. THERE CAN BE NO TOLERATION OF ANY TOXIC THE CAUSES MISCARRIAGES STILLBIRTHS AND DEFORMED BABIES. RISK IS ASSOCIATED WITH ANY LEVEL OF EXPOSURE AND ANY LEVEL OF EXPOSURE IS TOO MUCH. ISN'T THAT THE STANDARD PROTECTION YOU WOULD ASK FOR YOUR FAMILY AND YOUR CHILDREN. ISN'T THAT THE STANDARD OF PROTECTION YOU WOULD BE BANNED FOR YOURSELF. SO WHY DO WE ALLOW FARMWORKERS TO CARRY THE BURDEN OF PESTICIDES ON THEIR SHOULDERS. HE ENDURED A THIRTY SIX DAY FAST TO PROTEST THE USE OF PESTICIDES. MY WITNESSES TODAY WILL BE NICOLE CHAVEZ BENEATH THAT UNITED FARM WORKERS. TYLER SMITH FROM EARTH JUSTICE AND I WILL HAVE AVAILABLE BARBON CHAN FROM EARTH JUST AS WHO WILL HELP ANSWER ANY TECHNICAL QUESTIONS THANK YOU MISTER. THANK YOU SENATOR.

AND WHAT TO A GOVERNESS ANNOUNCED THE START OF THE CANCELLATION PROCEEDING OR BAN ON QUICKER PLUS. THE DOCTOR CHILL BUT THE GOVERNOR THAT'S PARTLY. DEAL WITH THE CHEMICAL INDUSTRY. ALLOWED THE CONTINUED USE OF THE BRAIN DAMAGING CHEMICAL A GRANULAR FORM. THE DOCTOR COULD CARRY KAREN ROSS OF THE RECOMMENDED PRODUCTS THAT FROM CANCELLATION. THE GOVERNOR'S LEUPOLD DANGEROUS. SECRETARY'S WANT. THANK YOU MEDICAL EXPERTS WITHOUT THE COUNTRY HAVE STUDIED THE BRAIN DAMAGE I'M A CO WROTE RIGHT DECADE IN ALL ITS FORMS.

GOOD MORNING REBEKAH MARKETS ON BEHALF OF CALIFORNIANS FOR PESTICIDE REFORM AND PESTICIDE ACTION SUPPORT OUR PESTICIDE ACTION NETWORK NORTH AMERICA AND STRONG SUPPORT THANK YOU. THANK YOU. MODERATOR IS THERE ANYONE ELSE. DO IT ONE MORE ITS LINE FORTY PLEASE GO AHEAD. LEAVE THE LEAK BREAST CANCER PREVENTION PARTNERS IN SUPPORT OF SB EIGHTY SIX. THANK YOU. WE HAVE NO FURTHER IN Q. AT THIS TIME. NOW WE HAVE TWO WITNESSES OPPOSITION TESTIFIED IN THE WITNESS VIDEO CONFERENCE WHERE. WARRANT NO ONE HUNDRED ON BEHALF OF SEVERAL ORDER EVER CULTURAL ORGANIZATIONS INCLUDING WESTERN PLAN HOW THIS IS. HELLO ZIP MUTUAL WE ARE GO AHEAD. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE LEARNING NO AND HE TO COME HAVE A WESTERN PLAN HEALTH ASSOCIATION CAL CITRUS MUTUAL CALIFORNIA'S AT CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF HAS CONTROL ADVISORS AS WELL AS SEVERAL OTHER AG ORGANIZATIONS IN OPPOSITION SB EIGHTY SIX- WHAT I'M GONNA TALK ABOUT IS SOME OF THE CONCERNS THAT WE HAVE WITH THE FINDINGS OF THIS BILL IT DOESN'T PAINT THE WHOLE PICTURE OF WHAT WE DO HERE IN CALIFORNIA OR THE STUDIES THAT HAVE GONE INTO NOT JUST GRANULAR CORPORATE FOSS BUT ALL PESTICIDES HERE IN THE STATE- PESTICIDES CARRY RISKS WE'RE NOT. GOING TO GET AROUND THAT POINT IT'S A PESTICIDE BUT WHAT WE DO HAVE IS THE DEPARTMENT HAS SAID REGULATION HERE IN CALIFORNIA THAT DOES EXTENSIVE STUDIES ON ALL PESTICIDES AND ONE FOR PURE FARCE THAT MEANS AERIAL SPRAYS GRANULAR ALL FORMS OF THEM THEY AREN'T LEAVING ANYTHING OUT- THERE'S ACTUALLY A MEMO DATED AUGUST TWELFTH TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN FROM THE PART SIDE OF ELATION TO THE FOR DEPARTMENT. OF TALKING ABOUT THE STUDY TO AND WHY THEY DID IT JUST TO THE CANCELLATION PROCESS ON BECAUSE OF DRAFTING DIETARY CONCERNS. NOT I'M- BECAUSE THEY DO HAVE. EVIDENCE THAT IT POSES THE SAME CONCERNS SO THERE WERE STUDIES DONE ON THAT. FURTHER WE HAVE EXTENSIVE PROGRAMS HERE IN CALIFORNIA WITH DPR CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF FOOD AND AGRICULTURE AND OTHER ORGANIZATIONS. THAT SPECIFICALLY MAKE SURE THAT ANY PESTICIDE IS NOT ENTERING OUR WATER SYSTEM. OR OUR FOOD SYSTEM AND CAUSING RESIDUE- THERE HAVE BEEN NO ILLNESSES OR INJURIES REPORTED IN CALIFORNIA. WHEN IT COMES TO GRANULAR CHLORPYRIFOS. THERE'S ALSO BEEN EXTENSIVE STUDIES DONE ON IT AND THE FINDINGS ON ACCOUNT FOR THIS THEY TALK ABOUT. ALL USES A POOR PAIR FOR US THEY TALK ABOUT IT BEING BROUGHT HOME- AND EXPOSED TO SIBLINGS AND OTHERS. I WILL TELL YOU IT'S A VERY RESTRICTIVE PESTICIDE RUNNING PARKER FOSS IS ONLY ALLOWED TO BE USED IN VERY LIMITED CIRCUMSTANCES MOSTLY ON. JUST SPECIFIC CROPS THAT HAVE NO ALTERNATIVES FOR CERTAIN PASS. ANYONE WHO APPLIES IT FIRST HAS TO GET A LICENSE IN ORDER TO FIGHT THEY HAVE TO WEAR PROTECTIVE GEAR. AND THEN THERE ARE PERIODS WHERE NO ONE IS ALLOWED TO ENTER AN ORCHARD FIELD. IN AFTER THAT APPLICATION. TO ENSURE THAT NOTHING IS BEING TRACKED OFF THE FIELD AND INTERFERING. WITH CITIZENS OR THE ENVIRONMENT- WORKING SIR. CONTINUOUS YOUR MATH WE WILL GET MY TIME. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR ALL SAY THAT WE'RE CONCERNED ABOUT THE LEGISLATURE PASSING SOMETHING THAT- LEAVES OUT WHAT THE AMAZING WORK WE'RE DOING HERE IN CALIFORNIA SO WE ARE SPECIALLY OPPOSE. ALSO IN THE WITNESS VIDEO CONFERENCING ROOM WE HAVE TAYLOR. RUSSIAN ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA FARM BUREAU FEDERATION. PLEASE GO AHEAD. GOOD MORNING THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS TAYLOR OCEAN WITH THE CALIFORNIA FARM BUREAU WE'D ECHO THE COMMENTS I MADE BY MY COLLEAGUE AN AD THAT THIS BILL- INCREASES THE WORKLOAD ON ALREADY OVERBURDENED AGRICULTURAL COMMISSIONERS AND THE DEPARTMENT OF PESTICIDE REGULATION. AT THAT WILL HAVE POLICY AND FISCAL IMPLICATIONS INCREASING THE FREQUENCY OF REPORTING TO A QUARTERLY BASIS I WILL LEAD TO THE PUBLICATION OF POTENTIALLY INVALID REPORTS EVERY COUNTY AND THE DEPARTMENT UNDERTAKEN EXHAUSTIVE PROCESS TO ENSURE THAT THE DATA IN THE REPORTS ARE ACCURATE BEFORE THEIR PUBLICIZED. SHOULD THIS PROCESS BE DONE IN HASTE IN ORDER TO MEET THIS DEADLINE AND MISTAKES ARE MADE IT'S CERTAINLY THREATENS THE TRUTHFULNESS OF THAT DATA WHICH DOESN'T SERVE THE BROADER PUBLIC INTEREST IF ERRORS ARE FOUND AND JUSTIN'S ARE MADE PERIODICALLY WE'LL BE SEEING MULTIPLE ADDENDUMS TO EACH QUARTERLY REPORT. THAT ILL MAKE BEING ABLETO CHRONOLOGICALLY ASSESS THE AMOUNT OF USE MORE AND MORE DIFFICULT FOR THE PUBLIC TO ACHIEVE- IT ALSO WOULD REPRESENTATIVES AT SEGREGATION OF ONE ACTIVE INGREDIENT TO QUARTERLY REPORTING BASIS- THAT'S DIFFERENT THAN ALL OTHER. REPORTING REQUIREMENTS. AT THE WORK DONE BY AG COMMISSIONERS AND DPR IS NOT A CHEAP TASK- DEBEERS COST TO ADMINISTER THIS DATA. MANAGE THE DATABASE AND ASSIST THE COUNTIES IN DATA ENTRY IS ABOUT TWO MILLION DOLLARS NEARLY HALF OF THIS GOES TO COUNTY AYE COMMISSIONERS FOR THAT DATA ENTRY ALONE. THESE ACTIVITIES ARE NOT FUNDED BY THE GENERAL FUND DOLLARS OR BY COUNTY FUNDS. RATHER THE WORK IS PAID FOR BY FEES ON REGISTRATIONS AND THE MILL SAYS MINT WHICH IS THAT FEE ASSESSED ON. I'M ALL PASS A SALES IN CALIFORNIA. THE DEPARTMENT STRETCHES THESE FUNDS TO ALSO COVER THE REMAINDER OF THE ESSENTIAL FUNCTIONS OF DPR LIKE ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING. RISK ASSESSMENTS AND EDUCATING THE PUBLIC AND APPLICATORS. ALL OF WHICH HAVE INCREASED OVER TIME. ADDING DVRS COMMIT AND COMMISSIONERS REPORTING. TO THE BILL WILL NOT ASSUREDLY DIRECT FUNDING AND LEAVE OUT PRIME. FUND ON. OR ON. WE THE- ON IN FOR CHANCE. IN FOR PUBLIC HEALTH BUT IN THIS PARTICULAR INSTANCE WE CAN'T IDENTIFY INDISCERNIBLE PUBLIC BENEFIT FROM THE BILL. THAT WOULD RESULT IN MORE SIGNIFICANT ADMINISTRATIVE FINE CON. THANK YOU. THANK FOR ALL. MODERATOR DO WE HAVE ANY WITNESSES ON THE LINE IN OPPOSITION FOR SB- SB EIGHTY SIX- IF SO PLEASE INTRODUCE. THEM AND LET THEM SPEAK. OKAY LADIES AND GENTLEMEN IF YOU WOULD. TO OPPOSE PLEASE PRESS ONE THEN AT THIS TO. ONCE IT'S. ONE ZERO. WE DO HAVE A FEW COMING UP IN JUST A MOMENT WHILE WE GIVE THEM THEIR LINE NUMBERS. THE PROCEEDS WITH ONE AFTER THE OTHER. ONE MOMENT HERE THEY'RE JUST ABOUT BACK WITH US. OUR FIRST IS GONNA COME FROM THE LINE FORTY ONE PLEASE GO AHEAD YOUR LINE IS OPEN. MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS ANTHONY MILLION ON BEHALF OF THE ALLMAN ALLIANCE OF CALIFORNIA AND THE CALIFORNIA STATE ASSOCIATION IN OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL THANK YOU. NEXT WE'RE GONNA GO TO THE LINE. ONE MOMENT THEY'RE NOT BACK WITH THIS. NEXT IS LINE FORTY TWO PLEASE GO AHEAD YOUR LINE IS OPEN. HI VALERIE NARROW FOR THE CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COM COMMERCE IN OPPOSITION TO SB EIGHTY SIX THANK YOU. ONCE AGAIN FOR OPPOSITION PLEASE PRESS ONE NINE ZERO. NEXT IS LINE FORTY SIX PLEASE GO AHEAD YOUR LINE IS OPEN. GOOD MORNING THIS IS MICHAEL BELL OF THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF BY VOTERS HAVE OPPOSED THANKS VERY MUCH. AND WE HAVE NO FURTHER IN Q. THANK YOU- SO MODERATE. WE WILL NOW ASK THE MEMBERS IF THEY HAVE ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. YES MISTER MATHIS. ARM MR SURE I'D I'D LIKE TO IF WE COULD HAVE- LAUREN COME BACK ON WITH SOME OF THE FINDINGS TO PAINT A BETTER PICTURE OF FOLLOW WHAT YOUR NOLAN IF YOU. TWENTY IT UP PLEASE COME ON THE LINE AND FINANCIAL LAST NAME PROPERLY. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER AND MISTER CHAIR LAUREN ONLY T. JACK. GO AHEAD MR MATHIS WHAT WE HAD IF YOU COULD KIND OF PAINT THE- A BETTER PICTURE OF THE CURRENT USAGE OF THE GRANULAR BECAUSE- MY UNDERSTANDING AND BEING VICE CHAIRMAN OF AGRICULTURE AND THEN GOING ON MULTILATERAL WRIST- WHEN WE DO APPLY. THIS CHEMICAL IN A GRANULAR WAY- THEY DON'T ALLOW ANYBODY OUT THERE IN INTO THE FILTER INTO THE ORCHARDS SHOW WHY WE ALL KNOW- WE CAN GO OVER THE FINDINGS ON. WHAT THE CHEMICAL DOES AND BIRTH DEFECTS IN ALL OF THESE THINGS BOY IT RAISES THE QUESTION OF. HOW IS ANYBODY OUT IN THE FIELD. IF THE FIELD SHUT DOWN DURING A SPECIFIC TIME AFTER THIS IS BEEN APPLIED IT'S TO ME IT'S KIND OF LIKE- WHEN IT WHEN HE YEAR HOUSE BLOG FOR TERMITES OR SOMETHING YOU KNOW YOU'RE NOT GONNA WALK INSIDE OF IT SO WHY WOULD ANYBODY BE OUT IN THIS FIELD- ESPECIALLY FARMWORKERS IF THEY KNOW THAT THIS IS BEEN APPLIED SO CAN YOU ENLIGHTEN US A LITTLE BIT MORE ON ON THAT FOR OFFICE AND HOW THAT WORKS- FOR THIS PARTICULAR REGULATION. YEAH I THINK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER FOR THE QUESTION NOT SAID VERY GOOD POINT YOU DESCRIBED IT VERY WELL SO WHEN IT COMES TO GRANULAR CORE PURIFY US USE IN CALIFORNIA THERE'S A VERY VERY LIMITED CROPS BUT IT CAN ACTUALLY BE USED ON AND AS I MENTIONED BEFORE THERE'S NO RESIDENTIAL USE ALLOWED HERE IN CALIFORNIA. SO WHEN IT IS BEING APPLIED TO THIS SPECIFIC CROPS THAT IT'S ALLOWED HERE IN CALIFORNIA WHAT YOU FIRST HAVE TO DO IS GET AT- A LICENSED. AS A SIDE- REGISTRANT TO COME OUT THERE AND ACTUALLY TELL YOU. YES YOU NEED THIS FOR YOUR CROP THIS IS WHY THIS IS THE SPECIFIC USE AND THIS IS WHEN YOU SHOULD USE THAT. AFTER YOU GET THAT PIECE OF PAPER IT GETS REPORTED TO YOUR LOCAL ACT COMMISSIONER THE I. COMMISSIONER ALSO HAS TO SIGN OFF. ON THE USE A GRANULAR PER PURIFY US IN A WAY THAT THAT PEST CONTROL ADVISER HAS TOLD YOU THAT YOU CAN USE IT. THEN IN ORDER TO APPLY IT TO THE ACTUAL WHETHER THAT BE A FIELD OR LIKE IN MY CLIENTS- CITRUS USES IT. OCCASIONALLY FOR CERTAIN TYPES OF ANTS- YOU HAVE TO GET AND NOTIFY THE AYE COMMISSIONER THAT YOU'RE USING IT. THE TEN APPLYING IT HAS TO BE. A LICENSE. IF I. TRAINING SPECIAL TRAINING I MEAN IT'S NOT JUST ANYONE WHO'S HANDED THIS MATERIAL THEN THEY HAVE TO APPLY IT EXACTLY HOW THE LABEL TELLS THEM THAT THEY CAN APPLY IT FOR THAT SPECIFIC CROP SO EACH PESTICIDE HAS A LABEL THAT GOES ALONG WITH IT. AND IF YOU APPLY IT IN ANY WAY THAT'S OUTSIDE OF THAT LABEL YOU ARE OPEN TO HUGE LIABILITIES HUGE FINES POTENTIAL JAIL TIME. ALL OF THESE THESE TYPES OF ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS- ONCE YOU APPLY IT BECAUSE IT IS A RESTRICTED USE PESTICIDES THERE HAS TO BE SIGNED INTO THAT IS PUT. UP IN THE FIELDS NOTIFYING PEOPLE THAT THE PESTICIDE HAS BEEN APPLYING AND THAT THERE IS NO ENTRANCE TO THE FIELD- FIRST INTERESTS THAT A FIVE DAY PERIOD WHERE NO ONE IS ALLOWED TO GO BACK INTO THAT ORCHARD. IN ORDER TO ENSURE THAT THERE'S NO EXPOSURE HAPPENING. IT'S GOOD TO KNOW TOO THAT WITH GRAMMAR PROCURE FOSS. WHAT IT IS IT'S COATED. WITH THE ACTIVE INGREDIENT CORKER POSSIBLE A SMALL AMOUNT F IT AND THEN IT'S A CLAY LIKE SUBSTANCE SO THAT IT MAKE SURE IT STICKS IN THE SOIL. AND THAT'S- BECAUSE IT MITIGATE RISK OF GETTING ON TO PEOPLE- IT SINKS INTO THE SOIL SO IT'S REALLY GOING AFTER THOSE ANTS. AND IT IT DOES IT'S NOT GONNA GET INTO WATER OR ANYTHING OF THAT NATURE. SO THAT'S KIND OF THE WHOLE PROCESS THAT GOES INTO IT AGAIN YOU HAVE TO GET DON'T CHECK FOR YOU TO APPLY THIS. ONE QUIET. YOU HAVE TO ENTER THAT NO GOING THE FIELD SIGN AND NOTICE IT SHOULDN'T. USE I. WELL WHAT DOES NOT IS. GET PEOPLE AND- THANK YOU. ALL MISTER FOR GOT GOT A FEW. I THANK YOU MISTER COMING OUT OF THE OUT WORLD I JUST WAS AT THE ALLMAN INPUT THIS IS SOME IN A LARGER BRIEFLY TOUCHED ON THE ANT SITUATION WHEN YOU HARVEST- ALMONDS. YOU SHAKE THEM OFF THE TREE THEY FALL ON THE GROUND IF YOU HAVE AN ANT PROBLEM WITHIN THAT PARTICULAR PIECE OF PROPERTY IT CAN BE ABSOLUTELY DEVASTATING TO THE CROWD. IT'S NOT JUST LIKE YOU LOSE A LITTLE BIT YOU LOOKED A LOT AND CAN BE ABSOLUTELY ECONOMICALLY DEVASTATING TO THE GROWER IT TOO IS EMPLOYEES AND ALL THOSE TYPES OF THINGS. AS WELL AS HER COMMENTS THAT. THERE IS A TIME FOR. YOU HAVE TO TREAT THIS PRIOR TO HARVEST. SO THE CHEMICAL. THE CALL FOR IT'S GONE BY THE TIME YOU GET THERE SO. WHEN IT COMES TO. CROPS NOT ALL CROPS ARE CREATED EQUAL. SOME CROPS ARE MORE SUSCEPTIBLE. TO BUG DAMAGE THAN OTHERS AND- THE M. INDUSTRY USES US. VERY A SPARINGLY BUT IT'S ALSO A TOOL IN OUR TOOLBOX. AND IF WE TAKE THAT TOOL WHERE IT ABSOLUTELY DEVASTATING FOR SHOULD. ONE OTHER QUESTION TO FROM. THE AGAIN MISTER CHAIR FOR THIS SECOND BY WILL BE APPLE. THEN AND NOW MAKE SURE YOU ASK EARLIER BY OKAY I WANT. SINCE I BELIEVE FLOOR QUESTION WERE GERMANE TO ALL OUR LORD THAT'S WHY I WANTED HAVE YOU FINISHED WITH YOUR QUESTION SIR NO SIR TOOLS BUT NOW THE MY MIKE IS FOR THE SENATOR DO YOU ACTUALLY HAVE ANY. EVIDENCE OF GRANULAR BEING TRACKED BACK INTO HOMES FOR ANY ANYTHING ALONG THOSE LINES THAT YOU CAN REPORT TO US ON. AS REGARDS THE FINDINGS. I DON'T PERSONALLY I'D LIKE TO ASK- MISTER JOHN OF YOU COULD ANSWER THAT WITH REGARDS TO. THIS TO CHANGE TAT INFORMATION PLEASE ANSWER THE QUESTION. HI AND- I THINK THAT THAT QUESTION IS ACTUALLY BETTER DIRECTED TOWARD TYLER- SMITH WHO IS WHO HAS STUDIED THAT. YEAH BUT THANK YOU THE- THERE ARE A pMEANT THAT A LOOK NOT ONLY AT- WORKERS EXPOSURE WHEN GRAIN GRANULAR QUICKER OCCUPIED BUT ALSO THE EXPO EUROPE THE WORKERS AROUND ANYWHERE- WHERE QUICKER ACOSTA DIVIDED MAYBE WORKING EITHER ON YOUR BY FIELD OR IN THE FIELD SOMETIME AFTERWARD YOU AT THE YEAH LOOK AT THAT THE TECHNICALLY. AND THEY FOUND- NOT ONLY DID- ALL OF THE GRAND NO ARE YOU THE CLIP CARAFA THAT THEY'VE APPROVED RESULT IN EXPOSURE OF CONCERN BUT OF COMPOUND TO WORKERS- BUT THEN. THE HI THE PATH DOCTOR TO IT FOR THE- ETHIC WITH ACT IT OFTEN IT DOCTOR AND- FOR GRANULAR YOU THE QUICKER. OUT GRANULAR YOU WITH THOSE WORKERS THERE ON THE IN ARE EXPOSED THEY AND HEY IT AND THIRDLY WHAT ON THE INTERNET THE CLOTHING AND GO BACK HOME WE FAMILY MEMBERS MAY EXPOSED WELL. BEING THAT WE HAVE THE MOST HIGHEST REGULATED- IN FRANKLY ARE ARE DEPARTMENTS WORLD RENOWNED FOR WHAT IT DOES DO YOU HAVE ANY. ACTUAL EVIDENCE OF THIS HAPPENING IN CALIFORNIA UNDER THE CURRENT SYSTEM.

THANK NATIONAL POLL ON WORKERS THE RIGHT THAT THEY NEED TO AVOID HARMFUL FRAGRANCE AND FLAVOR INGREDIENTS AND BEAUTY PRODUCTS THEY USE EVERY DAY AT WORK AND THE POWER TO SELECT PAPER PRODUCTS FOR THEIR CLIENTS THE LACK OF FRAGRANCE INGREDIENT DISCLOSURE CREATES A BUYER BEWARE SITUATION FOR CONSUMERS AND WORKERS MAKING IT IMPOSSIBLE THEM FOR THEM TO FULLY UNDERSTAND WHAT INGREDIENTS ARE IN THE PRODUCTS THEY USE. RENTALS ARE FOUND IN OVER 95% OF THE PERSONAL CARE PRODUCTS INCLUDING MOST NE'ER NAIL AND HAIR SALON PRODUCT THAT'S- ONE WORKERS FACE A DOUBLE WHAMMY OF TOXIC EXPOSURE. GIVEN THE YOUTH AND BEAUTY PRODUCTS BOTH IN THEIR PERSONAL AND PROFESSIONAL LIFE. NOT THE WORKPLACE SALON WORKERS ARE EXPOSED TO FRAGRANCES MORE THAN THE GENERAL POPULATION WHICH ADDS TO THEIR ALREADY DAILY EXPOSURE TO TOXIC CHEMICALS. LABOR INGREDIENTS CAN INCLUDE CHEMICAL THAT ARE CLASSIFIED AS CARCINOGENS REPRODUCTIVE DEVELOPMENTAL TOXICANTS NEAR TALK AGAINST AN ALLERGEN BY A DOOR TATE OF SCIENTIFIC BODIES IN FACT RESEARCH HAS FOUND THAT HAIR STYLIST AND BEAUTICIAN HOBBY FORTY SEVEN TIMES HIGHER RISK OF FRAGRANT SKIN ALLERGIES. THAN PEOPLE IN OTHER OCCUPATIONS ANY THIRD OF ALL FRAGRANCE CHEMICALS CURRENTLY IN USE HAVE BEEN FLAG AT THE TENSION LIKE TOXIC BY SCIENTISTS AROUND THE WORLD. FINALLY THE CODE NINETEEN PANDEMIC HAS EXPOSED OUR SOCIETIES PUBLIC HELP BUT WONDER ABILITY AND INEQUITIES WITH RESPECT TO CODE NINETEEN TOXIC CHEMICALS AND PERSONAL CARE AND BEAUTY PRODUCTS ARE PART OF THE PROBLEM WE KNOW THAT WE'RE NOT ALONE WORKERS ARE MADE UP OF POPULATION WHO ALREADY BEAR A DISPROPORTIONATE BURDEN OF TOXIC EXPOSURES. NOW SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE IS SHOWING THAT THERE CLOSER TO ENDOCRINE DISRUPTING COMPOUNDS FOUND IN FRAGRANCE PRODUCT ADD TO THEIR DAILY BODY BURDEN OF TOXIC EXPOSURE AND MAY AFFECT THEIR IMMUNE SYSTEM DEFENSE EXASPERATING THEIR VULNERABILITY. OF THE NINETEEN WE BELIEVE THAT CONSUMERS AND WORKERS HAVE A RIGHT TO KNOW IF HARMFUL INGREDIENTS ARE IN THE BEAUTY AND PERSONAL CARE PRODUCTS BRING HOME TO THEIR FAMILIES AND YOU DALY IN THEIR WORKPLACES AND URGE YOU TO VOTE I ON SB.

THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN. SENATOR I THINK YOU AND I HAD A DISCUSSION LAST YEAR BUT THIS BILL AND I'M A LITTLE DISAPPOINTED BECAUSE I MASS IN QUESTION THAT I ASKED YOU YOU GO AND- HOPE THE THAT WE CAN KIND OF RESOLUTION AND NOW THE BILL APPLIES TO. MANUFACTURE OF A COSMETIC PRODUCTS SOLD IN CALIFORNIA BUT SOLD AS WITH A LOWER CASE SAYS IT'S NOT DEFINED IN THE BILL CAN YOU. TELL ME WHAT WHAT YOUR CONCEPTION OF THE YOU KNOW WHAT WHAT THE MEANING OF SOLD IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IS. THAT I THINK PRETTY STRAIGHTFORWARD I'M SORRY YOU'RE DISAPPOINTED- IT'S A LITTLE IT'S PRETTY STRAIGHT. IT HAS TO BE SOLD IN CALIFORNIA SO THAT CALIFORNIA WE'RE ARE LEGISLATING CALIFORNIA STATE LAW. OUR HOPE IS THAT OTHER LEGISLATURES ACROSS THE COUNTRY WILL DECIDE TO DO THE SAME. SO HERE'S MY CONCERN. IF THERE'S AN INTERMEDIARY LIKE A DISTRIBUTOR IN THE DISTRIBUTOR PURCHASES PRODUCTS FROM A MANUFACTURER IN FLORIDA. AND UNBEKNOWNST TO THAT MANUFACTURER DISTRIBUTOR SELLS THOSE PRODUCTS IN CALIFORNIA HOW WITH THE MANUFACTURE IN FLORIDA. NO THAT THAT WERE SUBJECT TO THE DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS OF THIS LAW. WELL I DON'T KNOW. AND I THINK I GAVE YOU THAT SAME ANSWER LAST YEAR. OKAY BUT I MEAN I THINK IT WOULD BEEN EASILY NOT EASY ENOUGH TO SAY KNOWINGLY SELLS OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT JUST TO. TO ESTABLISH THAT CONNECTION THAT YOU KNOW WE'RE NOT TRYING TO IN FOR SOMETHING ABOUT AGAINST TO MANUFACTURE THERE'S NO DEA THEIR PROPERTY BEING DISTRIBUTED HERE. BOB THANK YOU SO AND I HAVE TO ASK BECAUSE- THIS IS A GOVERNMENT OBVIOUSLY- THIS THIS BILL. I DON'T THINK SO. I MEAN IT WHEN. DID WE GET AMENDED BECAUSE IT WAS WE HAD A LOT YEAR. AND I GOT HELD SO WE JUST USED A DIFFERENT VEHICLE. THAT'S RIGHT SO THE- OF WHAT I'M SAYING IS THAT THE AYE AYE. THE REASON I BROUGHT IT UP AS I LOVED THIS BILL THE CONTENTS THE BILL BEFORE US. ESTABLISHED A- A GRANT PROGRAM FOR PROVISION OF SERVICE DOGS TO VETERANS. I LOVE THAT BILL AND I JUST HAVE TO ASK WHAT HAPPENED TO IT BECAUSE- I WAS LOOKING FORWARD TO BOOK- WE LOVE THAT BILL TO WE HAD ON THERE WERE NUMEROUS PROBLEMS. ACTUALLY THE ASSEMBLY WITH THAT BILL- THE VETERANS COMMITTEE DID NOT LOVE THE BILL AND SO. I THOUGHT THAT WE COULD ALREADY. MONEY THE WE WERE LOOKING FOR. THEY THOUGHT THAT WAS ALREADY OUT THERE AND THAT WE COULD HELP VETERANS GROUPS APPLY FOR THAT. MONEY I WAS EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED WELL I LOW THAT BILL TO. IT GOT. IT GOT HELD WAS A MOVE ANY FARTHER BECAUSE IT SO IT WAS GOING TO DIE IN THE ASSEMBLY. SO WE USED IT FOR SOMETHING ELSE. I WOULD CERTAINLY ENCOURAGE YOU TO REDUCE IT WHEN FISCAL TIMES ARE BETTER. I THOUGHT WHAT'S GREAT IDEA AND IT WASN'T EVEN A FISCAL ISSUE IT WAS JUST THAT. THE VETERANS COMMITTEE THOUGHT THAT. WOULD THAT IT. THAT IT WAS. DUE TO PUT DUPLICATIVE THE DAY THESE GROUPS. HI FOR THAT MONEY I DIDN'T THINK THAT WE DIDN'T THINK THAT BUT- THEY DID SO. THAT'S HAPPENED UP THERE WAS A GREAT IDEA THANK YOU WITHOUT SO ANYONE ELSE. SENATOR LEYVA YOU MAY CLOSE SPEC MASS FOR NIGHT OF A SORRY FOR THE DRAMA. RIGHT THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS. MEASURES FOR AND FOR ALL OF YOUR HARD WORK AND THEN WE DID PASSES SUBCOMMITTEE EIGHT LAST YEAR. BY THE WAY JUST SOLD SOLD AT RETAIL WAS THAT. WHICH IS THE COMMON SENSE SORT OF DEFINITION.

AS THE BILL MOVES FORWARD PLEASE CONTINUE TO WORK WITH MY COMMITTEE STAFF GO AHEAD MR ALLEN YEAH THANK YOU MISTER. WELL OKAY WE'LL FIND THE TIME BECAUSE I KNOW YOU'VE WORKED VERY HARD WITH ALL STAKEHOLDERS YEAH AND I APPRECIATE I APPRECIATE THAT AND I WANT TO ALSO A PERSONALLY THINK YOU MAY CARE AND ALSO YOUR YOUR GREAT- COMMITTEE STAFF FOR ALL THE HARD WORK YOU'VE PUT IN. HELPING TO CONVENE EVERY AND GET US TO HAVE WHAT I THINK NOW WE NOW STRUCK A DEAL WHICH I'M I'M VERY PLEASE IT'S STILL. VERY MUCH MAINTAINS THE INTEGRITY OF THE BILL SO. ON THIS THIS BILL HAS TO DO WITH P. FOSTER IT'S A IT'S A CARCINOGENIC- CHEMICAL THAT IS I HAVE BEEN FOUND IN. FIREFIGHT QUIT FIREFIGHTING FOAM FORTUNATELY IT GETS INTO OUR GROUND WATER SUPPLY IN AND pFIRST. TO IF YOU WANNA KNOW MORE ABOUT THE D. ASSOCIATED P. FIVE OF THERE'S A FAINT A DOCUMENTARY ON. YOU WATCH ALL THE- WE- IT'S ABOUT. AND THE EXTENT TO WHICH IT WAS CAUSING CANCER AND A WHOLE ZONE. OF APPALACHIA- SO WE'RE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT A WAY TO PHASE OUT THESE CHEMICALS. REACHED OUT SEVERAL YEARS AGO EITHER WORKING ON THIS FOR A COUPLE YEARS NOW TO THE FIREFIGHTERS. THEY OBVIOUSLY CARE A LOT ABOUT. GETTING CANCER TWENTY YEARS FROM NOW BUT THEY CARE MORE ABOUT MAKING SURE THEY DON'T GET BURNED RIGHT THEN AND THERE WITH THE FIRING FOR THEMSELVES. RASCAL SLIPPING YES YES SORRY SORRY SIR SO- SO WITH SO OBVIOUSLY THEY THEY ULTIMATELY I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY WERE GOOD ALTERNATIVES OUT THERE THAT WOULD ALLOW THEM TO CONTINUE THEIR IMPORTANT WORK IN FIGHTING FIRES WHILE ALSO AT THE SAME TIME- PROTECTING THEIR MEMBERS FROM FROM FROM CANCER QUITE FRANKLY AND SO- AFTER MANY WEEKS AGO SHE SHINS WITH- WITH VARIOUS. FOLKS INCLUDING FROM THE THIS IS THE TIME ASSOCIATION AT THE OPPOSITION COALITION I BELIEVE WE RECENT AGREEMENT ARE THE AMENDMENTS ARE WILL BE PUT INTO PRINT APPROPRIATIONS BUT THE CHANGES INCLUDE EXACTING AND STORAGE IN THE POOL AT ALL RIGHT. CENTER TRUST WELL REFINERS IN TERMINALS OUT TO TWENTY THIRTY TWO WHICH INCLUDES INCREASE DISCRETION BY THE FIRE MARSHAL BUT THE IDEA BEING. THAT THEY CAN ONLY GRANT THIS WAIVER- IF THERE THERE'S NOT A GOOD ALTERNATIVE WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE FOLKS CAN FIVE FIRES AT REFINERIES OBVIOUSLY. THAT'S THAT'S VERY IMPORTANT. OUR PROVIDING A THREE YEAR DELAY FOR P. FOSS PHONE PHASE OUT STRUCTURE SO THAT IF YOU HAVE A FIXED PHONES SUPPRESSION SYSTEM FOR EXAMPLE SO TO ACCOMMODATE WITH. BY OUR CAN CAN PLAN AND- IS IT. PHONE AFTER FEDERAL REQUIREMENTS ARE CHANGED. SO WITH THESE CHANGES THE BILL PROVIDES ADDITIONAL TIME FLEXIBILITY FOR INDUSTRY TO TRANSITION FROM P. FOSS PHONES. AND PROVIDES IMPORTANT CONTAINMENT PROVISIONS FOR ANY USES BEYOND TWENTY TWENTY TWO. TO PREVENT THE RELEASE OF THE FOAM INTO THE ENVIRONMENT. HI THIS IS A COMMON SENSE- WATER AGENCIES ARE SUPPORTING THE BILL BECAUSE GIVEN THE CONTAMINATION LEVELS IN OUR DRINKING WATER THE LEAST WE CAN DO IS STOP MAKING THE PROBLEM WORSE. THE LONGER WE WAIT THE MORE PEOPLE WILL BE EXPOSED IN FACE LIFELONG HEALTH AFFECTS. NOW IS THE TIME TO STAND UP FOR OUR FIREFIGHTERS FOR CHILDREN ARE COMMUNITIES FROM THIS UNNECESSARY SOURCE. OF PEACE. OSHA THE FACT IS THERE ARE ALTERNATIVES OUT THERE. THEY CAN BE USED TO FIVE FIRE SAFELY. THAT WON'T CAUSE. CANCER AND BIRTH DEFECTS.

ACTUALLY CLOCK BY FIRE FIGHTING THE POSSIBLY CARCINOGENIC OCCUPATION. FRANK THIS IS THE BEST PLACE TO FIND IN THE WORLD TO SPEC THAT OUR LINE OF WORK CAUSE CANCER. MANY CRAPPIE FIRE FIGHTING FOAMS KICKING PEOPLE OFF CHEMICALS THAT HAVE BEEN LINKED TO SEVERAL TYPES OF CANCER. AND A VARIETY OF OTHER HEALTH PROBLEMS. FOR THE MORE RESEARCH HAS SHOWN THAT OUR FIREFIGHTING PP THE EQUIPMENT UPON WHICH WE RELY TO DO OUR JOBS CAN CONTAIN. CHEMICALS CHEMICAL ATTACK NOT ONLY FIREFIGHTERS BUT EVERY MEMBER OF EVERY COMMUNITY THAT WAS SIR. THESE FIREFIGHTERS WILL ALWAYS PUT OUR DUTY TO PROTECT PUBLIC FIRST SO WITHOUT HESITATION WERE REPEATEDLY EXPOSED TO CONDITION THE INCREASE OUR RISK OF BEING DIAGNOSED WITH CANCER ONE DAY. AS A RESULT WE NEED TO MAKE UP GROUND IT OUT AGAIN CANCER THE FIRE SERVICE BY MINIMIZING OUR EXPOSURE TO CARCINOGENS WHEREVER POSSIBLE. ELIMINATING OR REDUCING EXPOSURE TO PEOPLE OF CHEMICALS AND FIRE FIGHTING FOAMS AN INCREASE IN AWARENESS ABOUT THE PRESENCE OF PEOPLE CAN. AND GEAR.
